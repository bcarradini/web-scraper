Wong, Lai Phooi-Ching","In a country like Singapore, which is rated high in power distance and low in indi vidualism (using Hofstede's dimensions of national cultures), interviews for entry- level positions in multinational corporations (MNCs) may reveal subtle clashes in culture. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed transcripts of job interviews involving nine English-speaking applicants from Chinese backgrounds and two experienced interviewers from Anglo-American MNCs in Singapore. Our assumption was that a person's cultural background and upbringing influence his or her perform ance at job interviews. The findings reveal that Chinese applicants tend to defer to the interviewer (i.e. superior) and focus on the group or family, besides being averse to self-assertion. Hence, applicants from a Chinese background may be dis advantaged when being interviewed for jobs with MNCs which are heavily influ enced by Anglo-American culture."

Fernandez","Since 1976, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) has encouraged business schools to include ethics in their curricula. Because lan guage is the means for conveying values, including ethical values, business com munication faculty play an important role in deciding what should be taught, and how. But until very recently, most researchers failed to look specifically at actual practices and perceptions in the workplace. To address that need, we conducted a survey of 250 business leaders concerning their ethical preferences and compared our results with an earlier study of business faculty and students. The survey, adapted from one used in the Arthur Andersen Business Ethics Program, consists of 20 narratives which presented respondents with the need to judge the impor tance of certain issues and their approval or disapproval of the action or decision described. We found no significant differences in responses to the 14 items which addressed ethical issues in such areas as creating ..."

One group of students may face particular challenges in this environment: those with high degrees of writing apprehension. This study examined the online communications behavior of such students as they communicated with both familiar and unknown audiences via Internet newsgroups. Low-apprehensive writers tend to exhibit simi lar communication strategies in both types of newsgroups. But high-apprehensive writers contributed more, initiated more topics of discussion, and felt more com fortable participating in electronic discussions with unknown audiences than they did when communicating with familiar audiences."

Babcock","Case studies tend to embed the language and values of the culture in which they are created. To use an American-based behavioural simulation, Looking Glass Inc., in Hong Kong, we needed to adapt it to the students' language environment and proficiency, their culturally derived behaviours, and their understanding of the context of American business. In Hong Kong, the norms prescribing language use are complex and contradictory; English is a major business, government, and legal language, but Cantonese and sometimes Mandarin have a continuing presence, especially in oral communication. The English in the simulation, however, reflect ing the authors' emphasis on realism, included slang and idiomatic expressions that were confusing even to students otherwise fluent in the language, and thus we had to modify materials to aid comprehension. We also had to adjust our administra tion of the materials to account for cultural differences between the individualistic and low power distance dimensions of the American ..."

Yet in reality effective lis tening is a skill that needs to be developed as a prerequisite for successful practice of the more 'active' skills of speaking and writing. The insurance industry is a prime example of an industry that relies heavily on good listening skills for effective marketing. We conducted a study in Singapore of how listening is perceived by people involved in insurance. We found that more experienced people were well aware of its key role although students majoring in insurance believed speaking was more important. This study confirms earlier research: in the insurance indus try in Singapore there is a gap between the perceived need for good listening and the degree to which good listening skills are perceived to be possessed by insurance agents."

Thomas","As a result of a major revision of the undergraduate curriculum in the Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina, we were given the task of establishing a center for business communication. Based on this experience, we present our strategic consultancy model for launching such a center. The model employs the strategic management paradigm of identifying the principle players in the process; identifying stakeholders; defining goals; analyzing strengths, weak nesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis); establishing consultancy relationships; and evaluating results. The model proved successful in writing a proposal for the center, implementing the center, and evaluating the center's work."

Theye","To determine what aspects of writing are most important in a business context, previous researchers have often surveyed business professionals as well as business faculty. We recently took a different approach. We asked business professionals to critique and evaluate a set of writing samples. We then asked business faculty to evaluate the same samples, and we analyzed the results from the two groups. We found that professionals judge writing on different criteria than do faculty. While both groups emphasize organization, professionals also emphasize wording/style, content, and sentence structure more than do faculty, who emphasize conciseness, spelling/grammar, appearance, and purpose. In addition, professionals are signifi cantly more lenient in assigning grades than are faculty and spend less time in evaluating the writing. In general, business professionals judge papers more on substance (content) and less on style (mechanics) than do business faculty."

Limaye,"Two assumptions underlie the teaching of international business communication. First, perceptual variations exist within a country, and they sharpen even more across countries and cultures. International business communication students need to be aware of such differences on substantive issues. Second, critical pedagogy maintains that making students think and revisit their worldviews through an encounter with discomforting or decentering ideas is a valuable teaching and learn ing tool. Exposing students in my class to controversial propositions caused them to demonstrate a gamut of reactions from agreement and disagreement to anger, pity, disbelief, and a sense of discovery."

They also benefit from understanding how people learn because they are likely to have to incorporate such understanding when, as managers, they implement orga nizational change. Moreover, they have to become life-long learners themselves as they adapt to new business environments. Business communication classes can perform an important role in preparing students to meet these challenges by intro ducing them to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Kolb's experiential learning cycle."

Cathy Sullivan","To improve the writing skills of accounting students, we developed a structured writing effectiveness program across three junior level courses in the accounting major: tax, cost, and financial accounting. Writing counted for approximately five percent of the grade in each course and accounting professors discussed grammar, sentence structure, and word choice. A consulting expert on writing also con tributed to the program. We tested the results of our program empirically through both a pretest/posttest design and a control/treatment group comparison. The results provide evidence that our writing across the curriculum project significantly improved the students' writing skills."

Arbaugh,"While the number of college courses being delivered via the Internet is increasing rapidly, our knowledge of what makes these courses effective learning experiences for students is still limited. Therefore, I conducted a study that examined the effects of technological, pedagogical, and student characteristics on student learn ing in Internet-based MBA courses. Of these characteristics, I found that only those reflecting instructor efforts to create an interactive classroom environment were significantly associated with student learning. Other characteristics such as the perceived ease of use of the course software package, the perceived flexibility of the online classroom environment, and the amount of time students spent logged onto the course Website were not significantly associated with student learning. These findings suggest that while some level of technological sophistication may be important, teaching expertise may be the primary criterion for teaching success in the online classroom environment..."

The differences derive from the need to adapt the meanings of existing expressions or to find new expressions for different things and to borrow expressions from different cultures. Separation and slow means of com munication also cause differences and encourage one side to retain archaic expres sions that others have abandoned or modified. The differences in vocabulary can be grouped into four categories: the same expression with differences in style, con notation, and/or frequency; the same expression with one or more shared and dif ferent meanings; the same expression with completely different meanings; and dif ferent expressions with the same shared meaning. These differences in vocabularies affect understanding of all varieties of English. To bridge differences in Enghsh language vocabularies, international busi..."

However, trainee police officers may be wary of training conducted by someone outside of law enforcement. This article lends support for using a needs assessment that helps trainers overcome organizational and personal boundaries in such a training class. In teaching interpersonal communication for groups of 8 to 12 police officers in two-hour training sessions, I learned that strate gically using the results of a needs assessment could encourage trainees to have a vested interest in the class and help the trainer feel competent and comfortable."

The approach is based on the concept of schemata (Rumelhart, 1980; Cook, 1994) and on Swales's (1990) techniques for genre analysis. It is divided into four interrelated teaching stages: background information, communicative purposes, text structure, and the implica tions of genre comparisons. Among the four stages, teaching the communicative purposes is the most important. This approach has been used effectively to teach students how to write sales letters in English and Chinese."

For this article, recruiters at several large commercial banks in the US were inter viewed on the usage of Internet recruiting tools. The interviews identified a number of trends that are fairly uniform across these banks, including the following:1. Recruiters are using the Internet at an increasing rate.2.

Gibson","The ability to work in groups is vital for today's workforce, yet the existence of the necessary skills among students is questionable. Although group activities are now common, specific classroom instruction in effective group participation skills is not. Moreover, students recognize the need for such instruction. Content analysis of students' self-descriptions identified ten categories of deficiencies: conflict avoidant, public speaking anxiety, leadership, shy, oral skills, lack motivation, brainstorm ing, impatient,-intolerant, dislike groups. These weaknesses were addressed by a vuriety of pedagogical exercises including individual presentations, type or tem perament identification, an enhanced understanding of argument and brainstorm ing, and ways to encourage substuntive, but not procedural or affective, conflict. Student-perceived improvements were found in all categories, with the largest improvement in public speaking anxiety."

During this evolution, hundreds of authors and more than a dozen editors have contributed to BCQ's progress. Articles on a broad variety of topics have provided pedagogical support to new and experienced teachers alike. Presented here is a brief history of BCQ, a glimpse at BCQ's most popular manuscript topics, and a listing of its editors and most prolific authors.

This study compared what business communication instructors believe their stu dents learn and what writing skills they improve by completing the assignment with what students believe they learn and what writing skills they believe are improved. Data were gathered from members of the Association for Business Communica tion and from students who have completed a business report. Instructors see greater improvement in student writing skills than do students. To close this gap, faculty should offer more explicit explanations of the assignment and of the con cepts to be learned and the skills to be improved. They should also explain the cri teria for evaluation and help students assess their writing skills and set personal goals for improvement. Questionnaires are provided so instructors can compare their own perceptions with those of their students as well as with the instructors and students from this study."

In developing a course with a majority of non-Western participants at The University of Waikato, we adapted critical pedagogy to address the Western biases in the texts and approaches of intercultural communication. We selected both mainstream and alternative readings that allowed students to connect the field's neo-colonial business present with its colonialist past, to question the ethics and efficacy of an often skewed territorialisation of knowledge; and to redress tra ditional distortions by introducing perspectives from a range of critical and post colonial theorists. The readings were reinforced by student presentations of their own experiences crossing cultural borders. These experiences were then assessed in class, so that we didn't rely on the simulated experiences recorded in the conven tional texts."

This study collected data on three groups (self, peers, and instructor) to address four research ques tions related to (a) the usefulness of self and peer ratings as substitutes for instruc, tor evaluation of oral business presentations and (b) the relationship between vari ous content and non-content factors on overall perceptions of presentation quality. Data from this study suggest that (1) both holistic and analytical peer assessments are reasonable substitutes for instructor assessment when raters are trained; (2) self assessment does not closely reflect either peer or instructor assessments; and (3) peer assessment of delivery characteristics, command of material, and content strongly predict peer ratings of overall presentation quality."

Most rhetorical models consider only the writing center as occupying the middle ground between students and teaching faculty. A revision of that model, one in which the writing center and teaching faculty share the middle ground, is more appropriate for a business writing center. Moreover, writing assignments best serve business student writers when students must situate themselves within the discourse community of a post-graduation employer. Instead of fostering an adversarial relationship, business writing centers function most effectively for students when the center complements the classroom faculty."

Some of the insights on politeness, tact, and def erence found in the work of Brown and Levinson, Leech, and Fraser and Nolen can help provide guidelines for assessing how important a you-attitude may be in writing about a particular real-world situation, and case grammar and information structure can inform strategies to enhance the expression of a you-attitude. Rather than being a binary variable, you-attitude appears to be gradable, and an infor mal student assessment of the you-attitude expressed in ten versions of the same passage suggests that the various strategies for enhancing the you-attitude conveyed by a text appear to have a cumulative effect, so that a greater sense of you-attitude is created when more strategies are used."

Immediacy behaviors represent instructors' attempts to reduce the social distance between themselves and their students. While my study found that immediacy behaviors were positive predictors of student learning and course satisfaction, such other factors as student attitudes toward course soft ware, the length of a course, and prior student and instructor experience with Web-based courses were also significant predictors.

The internal proposal (also known as the justification report), on the other hand, is applicable for almost any student's future career. It provides an opportunity for students to develop the competence and confidence to express their ideas in the workplace, encouraging them to demonstrate awareness and initiative, utilize problem-solving skills, and create a persuasive strategy. Because students are motivated to com plete this real-world assignment, it also inspires some of their best work."

Communicating across cultures using technology can be a difficult task. It requires understanding the advantages and limitations of technol ogy and how to build relationships via technology. Virtual team members need to choose an appropriate communication channel for their purposes and be sure to balance distance work with face-to-face communication. Team leaders should encourage open communication and brainstorming, and avoid assignment of blame. Other strategies for success include: 1) develop a network of good relation ships built on trust and understanding, 2) show respect for other cultures and lan guages, and 3) understand how diversity strengthens the team."

This campaign was motivated by govemment perception and media reports of a decline in English language skills.Using a 40-item questionnaire, this study investigated whether faculty at a large Singapore business school shared similar perceptions of inadequate communi cation skills, in this case among undergraduates, and also sought to explain their perceptions. The findings indicate that the faculty perceived undergraduate com munication skills to be in need of improvement, thus lending support to employer and government criticism. An analysis of survey responses revealed some probable underlying causes for faculty perceptions, including an apparent lack of real com mitment to the improvement of such skills."

Depending on the nature of the project and the policies at the faculty member's university, such projects may require prior approval by the university's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Therefore, business communication faculty will benefit from an understanding of three areas related to IRB review of class projects involving human subjects research: (1) whether their institution requires such class projects to be reviewed by the university's IRB and, if so, what form the review takes; (2) how they can adapt classroom activities, materials, and assignments so that human subjects research by students complies with IRB policies; and (3) how they can relate IRB policies to issues that students may face in their future professional lives."

Using a new process—silence—for developing listening skills, this study compared the effects on perceived listening effectiveness of a self- imposed period of silence versus attending a lecture on listening skills versus a combination of a self-imposed period of silence and attending a lecture. While no significant differences were found for either lecture or silence or the combination of the two on measures of perceived listening effectiveness, qualitative data from journals kept by the participants suggest that the act of self-imposed silence greatly improves awareness of one's listening effectiveness and the value of developing beneficial listening skills."

A minority applicant's name, address, education, work history, extra curricular activities, and choice of references may trigger unfavorable assumptions by the reader and unfairly influence the selection process. To reduce the chances of ""detection"" and being eliminated prematurely, some minority students Anglicize their names, use street addresses of relatives and friends in more desirable parts of town, and downplay ethnic-specific education, jobs, and affiliations. Concealing one's ethnic background, however, may be difficult and, more important, may be counterproductive.

One model, used at Clemson University, is a formal academic consultancy service in which students are paid for their work with for-profit businesses. Another, used at the University of North Texas, also incorporates for-profit clients but operates in the more traditional classroom setting where student teams are not paid for their work. Whatever the approach, client projects facilitate communication between academia and business, enlist the services of professionals in a variety of fields to help shape the education of future graduates, offer opportunities for students to gain practical experience that surpasses any classroom simulation or case study, and keep instructors in touch with business trends and practices."

An analysis of this process makes three contributions to communities of practice scholarship: It documents “catalyzing” circumstances for CoP creation, places the Ph.D. quest in the context of existing CoP theory, and identifies a critical point that precedes CoP formation in the existing CoP model. Highlighting the shared experience of postgraduate students opens up opportunities for CoP formation that can help students emerge from isolation into a supportive peer community."

When conflicts arise in an online class, the activity system of the class has to be kept in balance for the course to continue functioning effectively. Activity theory and distributed learning theory are useful for studying this process of conflict resolution and online communication.

Given the importance of culturally acceptable spelling, the need to be aware of and sensitive to cultural differences, and strong reactions to variation in spelling, it is important to understand the differences in these two spelling systems. Families of words that illustrate spelling practices draw attention to differences between the American and British spelling systems. Under at least some circumstances, business communicators should accommodate for spelling differences when communicating with those from other cultures. Implementing the presented teaching ideas based upon reacting, discussing, adapting, researching, and writing can clarify understanding of the American and British business-related spelling systems and help learners to prepare more culturally sensitive business documents when appropriate."

This focus on corporate strategy—the language and concepts that concern the mission and direction that an organization should adopt—requires, in turn, that faculty enact several roles to assist students in developing their final assignments, strategic presentations, and reports. Faculty play the role of specialists in corporate strategy, communication specialists, and stand-ins for the primary audience(s) for these assignments. Working with students on these assignments underscores two important values in MBA education: providing students with the means to engage in discussion at the CEO level where decisions about the company’s strategic direction are made, and demonstrating to students that the strategic assignments they produce belong to a larger communication campaign for getting buy-in for corporate strategy.

Learner-to-learner, noncontent-related statements showed minimal affective behavior, but that lack did not have a negative effect on grades.

Whereas Singaporean MBA/EMBA programs sit in a highly internationalized environment with substantial foreign student intake, and whereas Singapore is known for adopting best practices in education from around the world, communication training for management evidences a veneer of Asian content and imitation rather than innovation. These findings caused the authors to rethink what they have traditionally regarded as management communication and to consider the need for further internationalization, not only in this multicultural city-state but worldwide."

Hardy, IV","Since 1994, the University of South Carolina at Columbia and the Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration) have offered a joint master’s degree in international business. Communication instruction was initially a stable component of the program, with a week-long course at the beginning and a report-writing workshop at the end, followed by individual instruction in preparing deliverables for a consulting field project. Since the field projects were phased out in 2003, students continue to receive the one-week communication course in Vienna; after that, they have voluntary access to individual instruction from the Center for Business Communication at the University of South Carolina and exposure to in-class communication workshops as scheduled by faculty across the business disciplines. Although student feedback is positive, these instructional methods currently lack consistency. To achieve such consistency, a communication center can help to integrate instruct..."

The methods of delivery, however, do not seem to follow any particular model, such as the common U.S. practice of a separate program or department. Required courses are found at 10 of the 24 schools, including two at 2 schools. Elective communication courses are offered at 8 schools, and related courses, those with a communication component, appear at all but 1 school. Communication is perceived as being an integral part of overall management development and global leadership, as opposed to a skill that could be assessed via testing or other assessment."

Brumberger,"A survey of BizCom listserv subscribers suggests that visual rhetoric receives relatively little attention within business communication curricula. Results indicate that programs typically do not require a course in visual rhetoric, and on average, 20% or less of teaching in undergraduate courses is dedicated to visual communication. The findings suggest that business communication curricula may not adequately prepare students for the multimodal communication tasks they are likely to encounter in the workplace, particularly those tasks that rely on knowledge of visual rhetoric. Possible solutions include adding courses, integrating visual communication more deeply into existing courses, contextualizing existing design projects to ensure they are more than software exercises, and incorporating visual communication into other typical course projects."

The authors found that most students report conflicts that are process or relational in nature, with few students reporting task-oriented conflict. Nearly all students report discussing the conflict with third parties—individuals outside the organization and/or the conflict—and nearly all students find these discussions helpful in resolving or working through the conflict. Based on their literature review and research, the authors developed scenarios to help students “read” and resolve workplace conflicts. The scenarios use conversations with people outside the conflict—third-party discussions—to help students respond appropriately to the conflict."

The online segment of the test measures five competencies across three process levels; the in-class writing segment measures the same five competencies across higher process levels. The data can then be cross-referenced for multitiered measurements. The learning outcomes are derived from the grading rubric used in the business communication classes, thus bringing classroom grading practices into assessment at the program level. The core competencies, rubric, writing prompt, and sample questions are provided. The process of designing the assessment, engaging faculty participation, and measuring outcomes are detailed."

One way out of this position may be an act of disciplinary border crossing—aligning the field of business writing with progressive voices in business and management. This article describes a framework structured around key theoretical concepts from Senge’s The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization (1995). Senge’s text is surprisingly rhetorical, and I examine the associated framework in terms of its potential for invigorating both teaching and research in business writing, thereby building ethos for the profession."

Students in five sections of a course in written business communication composed the control group, whereas students in two sections composed the treatment group. On the first letter each group wrote early in the semester—before the treatment group began error labeling in remediation exercises—no significant differences were found in the writing performance of both groups. However, on their last letter written late in the semester, studentsin the treatment group significantly reduced the number of sentence-level errors they made, compared to students in the control group. The improved writing performance of the treatment group is attributed to error labeling in conjunction with error correction in the remediation exercises."

Barnes, Michael Keleher","The past two decades have seen an increased emphasis placed on the relationship between communication and ethics, a subject that philosophers have debated for centuries. An analysis of textbooks as disciplinary artifacts reveals that students enrolled in communication courses across the university are often presented with conflicting or contradictory ethics instruction. Commonly, business and technical communication textbooks advocate a foundational approach toward the subject, whereas interpersonal communication textbooks, as taught within the liberal arts, support a nonfoundational view. Rather than bolstering students’ understanding of the importance of ethical communication, such broad-based contradictions might lead to an overall ambivalence toward the subject. A critical pedagogy—one that acknowledges and explores this tacit disciplinary debate on ethics—would provide students a more comprehensive philosophical and historical basis for determining their own perspectives on ethical communication."

The purpose of this empirical study was to ascertain whether significant differences exist between faculty and student perceptions with regard to PPT's impact on perceived learning, classroom interactions, and student behaviors. The results indicated that (a) students have a significantly less favorable overall view of PPT's influence on cognitive learning and classroom interaction than faculty members; (b) unlike faculty members, students do not believe that posting notes on the Web will decrease their motivation to attend class; and (c) both faculty members and students perceive that PPT has a favorable impact on notetaking quality, content recall during exams, emphasis on key lecture points, and holding student attention during class.

In fact, scores have been relatively stable since the 1980s. The proportion of students with solid writing and reading abilities has held fairly steady but remained small during the past 25 years. During this period, however, the proportion of high school graduates who enter higher education has soared. Thus, more students with weak verbal abilities now enter college. Initiatives that encourage people to continue their education have succeeded, whereas initiatives to improve writing, reading, and reasoning abilities have not. The complex causes of entering college students' weak verbal abilities include social and cultural forces as well as decisions by educational institutions. By understanding the complicated history of this issue and reframing it in positive terms, business and technical communication faculty can help effect change."

Rejecting a psychometric assessment approach in which component features of critical thinking are disaggregated, this study is based on a holistic scoring of student memos. Students were asked to recommend and justify a course of action to a lay client facing an ill-structured finance problem. Analysis of student memos reveals critical thinking weaknesses that may be ameliorated by changes in assignments or instructional methods. The memos reveal four kinds of critical thinking problems: (a) failure to address the client's problem, (b) random rather than purposeful application of finance tools and methodologies, (c) inability to translate finance concepts or methods into lay language, and (d) inability to construct rhetorically useful graphics. The curricular implications of this study are discussed."

The authors investigate whether students in the contemporary business classroom view PPT as a novel stimulus and whether these perceptions of novelty are related to students' self-assessment of learning. Results indicate that the degree of novelty that undergraduate business students associate with PPT-based teaching significantly relates to their perceptions of PPT's impact on cognitive learning and classroom interaction. Students' views of PPT as a novel stimulus are also associated with their perception of specific constructive and dysfunctional classroom behaviors and attitudes.

To meet their needs, U.S. professional communication faculty are designing short courses that can be delivered abroad during between-term periods and that foster an understanding of the situations and genres of the field within a context of cultural dislocation. Based on the courses described in this article, the best approach is to settle students in one location rather than touring; keep student numbers low by an entrepreneurial approach to keeping costs low; encourage students to live as the locals do, in apartments rather than hotels; explicitly plan appropriate access to technology; use class time to provide structure and reflection, but allow free time for collateral learning; and make sure the course grows local roots."

However, few scholars have discussed the ethical implications of adjusting résumé keywords for the sole purpose of increasing searchbot hits. As the résumé genre has evolved over the past century, strategies of résumé “padding” have likewise evolved, at each stage violating one of four maxims of the Cooperative Principle. Direct factual misrepresentation violates the maxim of quality and is of course discouraged, but résumé writers have turned in succession to violations of manner (formatting tricks) and then more recently to violations of quantity and/or relevance with deceptive keywording techniques.

The results of a survey of 238 industry supervisors were collected over a 5-year period in the departments of English and communication at a private university in the Northeast. While the results suggest that student interns tend to meet their supervisors’ expectations in many areas, performance categories such as initiative, writing skills, and oral communication skills require increased attention in the ways we prepare students for their internships and post-graduation employment and, perhaps, the ways we help onsite supervisors develop expectations for and evaluate our interns."

Reeves",The graphic novel provides an attractive medium to communicate business concepts with a number of characteristics that may aid student learning in a more effective manner than traditional textbooks. The authors provide an overview of the graphic novel format and use McLuhan’s research on “hot” versus “cool” media as a theoretical base that highlights how and why this format can be a useful tool to present management content relevant for the current generation of business students. The authors provide examples of how the graphic novel medium could be applied to business concepts and conclude with an agenda for future empirical research.

Briefly put, classic PBL inverts the typical instructional sequence; rather than presenting concepts first and then asking students to apply them, PBL creates situations in which students must learn the concepts in order to solve a “problem” constructed for that purpose. Thus, students learn in an iterative process as they cycle through the three key questions: “What do we know?” “What do we need to know?” and “How will we learn it?” We advocate emphasizing three key elements inherent in classic PBL: rhetoricity, locality, and change."

However, there is a lack of well-grounded empirical data concerning precisely what accountancy employers mean by “oral communication” and what specific skills they value most highly. This article describes a research project investigating the importance of 27 oral communication skills for students intending to begin an accountancy career in New Zealand, as perceived by chartered accountancy professionals. It also examines how frequently accountancy employers are finding these desired skills in new graduates. The findings reported in this study offer important guidance concerning the oral communication skills that new graduates will find most useful in the New Zealand accountancy workplace and suggest useful directions for accountancy students internationally."

In this article, we use a commercially available assessment to investigate the relationship between information literacy and the key business communication skill of business writing. Information literacy scores obtained prior to instruction predicted performance in an undergraduate, upper-division business writing course. Similar results emerged regardless of whether participants considered English their best language."

The article focuses on teachers who want to integrate critical perspectives about business communication into their classes. A course ethos, learning groups, and an introductory activity were used to develop students’ thinking about business and management communication. These strategies encouraged collaborative peer learning in a large bicultural/multicultural lecture environment and developed learning relationships typically found in a small class context. In addition, the activities produced ongoing lecture learning groups in which business students could question their “trained incapacities,” boundaries, and assumptions gained from their experiences of communicating and managing relationships during these activities."

This article discusses how scenes from popular television series such as Everybody Loves Raymond, Friends, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show can be used to teach effective job interview skills in business communication courses. Television episodes may be used to examine in detail topics commonly covered in textbook discussions of job interviewing, such as attire, behavior, and interview questions; they may also be used to explore topics not typically addressed, such as gender issues and involvement of family members. The use of appropriate television scenes can enhance the job interviewing unit by attracting the students’ attention and generating productive class discussion.

However, the coverage of sustainability issues in business courses remains small at many universities. This article illustrates how business communication students can become cognitively, behaviorally, and emotionally involved in the analysis and evaluation of the complex sustainability paradigm via an assignment focusing on sustainability. The approach integrates several levels of learning, stretching students’ cognitive skills and enhancing the emotional competencies and behavioral skills needed to enter high-level business jobs."

Yet evidence of writing competency is not universally considered for admission to MBA programs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between the Analytical Writing Assessment Section (AWA) of the GMAT exam and a “critical thinking” writing assignment that is similar to the AWA. Results indicate that the AWA is significantly correlated with achievement, not only on the writing assignment but also with the final grade in a managerial communication course."

What is not so obvious is the specific written communication skill set employers look for and the extent those skills are computer mediated. Using survey research, this article explores the particular skills employers desire and their satisfaction level with new hires. Results indicate that basic writing mechanics are the skills in highest demand, followed by effective documentation. Except for email proficiency, employers do not consider computer-mediated communication competencies as important as traditional business communication skills.

Against the backdrop of the recent global financial crisis, the Aristotelian concept of ethos provides a framework to investigate linguistic features that express ethical stance. Text analysis software was used to produce frequency profiles of features that were then further interpreted qualitatively. Results showed that the executives used a variety of more or less explicit terms to maintain a strong focus on trustworthiness and commitment to moving forward. The findings can inform the development of teaching materials that help learners become more effective communicators in the context of IT-mediated financial reporting."

Cardon","Eportfolios are a powerful tool for business students to gain self-awareness and take control of their learning experiences. Ideally, they can be used as online profiles in the job application process, allowing more authenticity, personalization, and completeness than traditional résumés. In our colleges, eportfolios help students reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and form goals for professional development. Overall, however, our students’ eportfolios lack the professional touch of their résumés. We believe extensive coordination within a college is required to help business students create eportfolios that they can use to market themselves for professional positions."

Our philosophy underlying the use of eportfolio is influenced by narrative and sense-making theory. At the beginning of the semester, students record their experiences and accomplishments on eportfolio. We then guide students to identify the narrative themes running through their experiences, and to use those themes to develop personal brand statements, stories that demonstrate their strengths and values in action, and professional development plans.

Communication plays an important role in the instructor-student relationship, and students judge instructors’ ability to teach communication based on their ability to practice what they teach. The authors’ empirical study shows that students have higher expectations of their business communication instructors than they do of their other business instructors when it comes to their communication behaviors in and out of the classroom. The authors infer from the data that sensitivity to these expectations can improve student learning and instructor evaluations."

This qualitative study explores the role of the internship in narrowing the work expectation-reality gap. This article addresses two research questions: (a) What do students learn about work through internships that they did not know before? (b) How is this new knowledge reflected in their advice to future interns? Analysis of 59 intern exit interviews or surveys reveals two categories of communication-related discovery that in turn influenced subsequent advice messages. Practical implications for business curriculum and career development programs are discussed."

Thompson, Jennifer Hebblethwaite","Assurance of learning continues to be a hot topic in higher education. Both accreditation agencies and employers are asking a key question: Are we graduating students who actually have the knowledge and skills that we promise? This case study focuses on business writing in an MBA program and presents a prescriptive, five-step program to improve MBA students’ writing skills. The study provides example documents used in the assessment process and an example of data analysis used to “close the loop” in the assurance of learning cycle. The study concludes with lessons learned and recommendations for future improvements in the process."

French, Tracey Quigley Holden","Most communication research on bad news messages focuses on crisis communication, where attention is often limited to image repair strategies. The authors argue that a key indicator of an organization’s effectiveness in communicating “bad news” messages is its organizational culture. Developing an organizational culture that values positive organizational behavior can transform the way that “bad news” messages are crafted and received in the workplace. In this article, the authors demonstrate how organizational leadership and practice from the positive organizational behavior perspective can assist with communicating “bad news” messages, particularly during organizational crises."

Greer,"In response to current federal mandates requiring selected businesses and government agencies to use plain language (PL) when reporting information to the public, this article advocates the introduction of PL principles into current business communication curricula. Despite recent PL mandates and advances, many current business textbooks and curricula omit PL principles. Students must become familiar with PL principles in their business communication courses in order to apply PL effectively in the workplace. To accomplish this goal, the author focuses on defining PL, outlining the history and recent developments of PL, and listing the resources and exercises instructors can use to incorporate PL principles into business communication courses."

Even where business communications textbooks emphasize the importance of context and audience analysis to determine whether to adopt a direct or indirect arrangement when expressing bad news, many still favour an indirect approach. In reviewing 50 years of negative news research, this article highlights the major concerns that continue to influence the debate as educators challenge and question existing models for addressing this rhetorically complex message genre."

Veltsos,"Forty-six states require organizations to notify users when personally identifiable information has been exposed or when the organization’s data security measures have been breached. This article describes a qualitative document analysis of 13 data breach notification templates from state and federal agencies. The results confirm much of the typical advice for negative messages, but they suggest that the direct pattern may be an effective way to inform users as required by law, to overcome optimism bias, and to overcome rational ignorance. When a buffer is used, writers should not be afraid to refer to the bad news."

This article reports the results of exercises in which members of a dysfunctional multicultural class were assigned to teams and given a task to perform in an anonymous, virtual-team setting, as well as in a real-team setting. Team members contributed in a much more balanced manner in the anonymous virtual-team exercise.

One way to encourage employee engagement is to provide training in interpersonal communication. This research analyzes what one U.S.-based company is doing to achieve that goal. The company and the evolution of its communication training program are described, with a focus on an interpersonal communication component. Methods used for evaluating learning outcomes are outlined, along with some results. Finally, this study proposes several implications of this case study for business communication professionals."

This article suggests that business communication educators can realize this potential through three pedagogical changes: timing the assignment to coincide with reflective phases in the learning cycle, incorporating rhetorical context, and promoting abstraction and generalization. With these adjustments, the genre becomes a unique opportunity among reflective-reflexive documents because of its pervasiveness, timeliness, and rhetorical significance."

Traditional teaching has too often been based on a passive lecture model, dependent on an expert teacher who funnels knowledge into the somewhat retentive minds of students. More current learning theory suggests a different role for teachers—that of facilitators. Based on research about how people learn, this article advocates that teachers use more active, inductive instruction in the classroom and demonstrates a student-centered approach using classroom examples implemented in a required, college-level business communication course."

Business executives consider soft skills a very important attribute in job applicants. Employers want new employees to have strong soft skills, as well as hard skills. This study identified the top 10 soft skills as perceived the most important by business executives: integrity, communication, courtesy, responsibility, social skills, positive attitude, professionalism, flexibility, teamwork, and work ethic."

Messersmith","We synthesize the interdisciplinary literature into a heuristic for crafting effective organizational and supervisory apologies (the OOPS four-component apology). In the first experiment, we demonstrate how an offense committed by an organization is perceived to be more egregious than an offense committed by a friend or supervisor. Furthermore, results did not support that OOPS apologies are unequally effective if issued by a friend, supervisor, or organization. In the second experiment, we test OOPS apology-training effectiveness. Results indicated that trained participants crafted more effective apologies. Our apology heuristic is an innovation for training business communicators how to apologize effectively."

The model draws inspiration from (a) current-traditional rhetoric, modified for a business context, to address the need to write quickly, which I label the “prescriptive phase,” and from (b) cognitive rhetoric, again modified for a business context, to address the need to write effectively, which I label the “perceptive phase.”"

Ortiz,"To teach effective business communication, instructors must target students’ current weaknesses in writing. One method for doing so is by assigning writing exercises. When used heuristically, writing exercises encourage students to practice self-assessment, self-evaluation, active learning, and knowledge transfer, all while reinforcing the basics of good writing. Using writing exercises as a diagnostic or maintenance tool at different stages in the semester, in addition to the core assignments, can drastically improve undergraduate and graduate student writing and increase the probability that these students will transfer that writing knowledge into other courses and into their practices as professional writers in industry."

Price,Portfolios have long been a staple in professional writing courses: both in employment materials assignments and in entire classes that ask students to reflect on their experiential learning. Portfolios may also be used effectively in business communication teaching methods courses. This article details the justification and methodology for having a teaching portfolio as the capstone assignment in a business communication pedagogy course. It also explains how this portfolio may be used to anticipate programmatic assessment and verification of entry-level business communication courses during the accreditation process.

Though employing different methodologies, they saw similar outcomes. Through assessment of student reflections and discussions of course outcomes, both professors concluded that there is potential for collaborative service-learning projects between the two disciplines. This article discusses pedagogical approaches in the two courses, the theory and pedagogy on which the approaches are based, and practical ideas on how a collaborative professional writing/health studies service-learning project might be set up. Such ideas may provide a model for collaboration across disciplines."

Alexander","This article examines website headings used by Fortune 500 companies in their efforts to inform stakeholders about corporate social responsibility (CSR). Instead of using “Corporate Social Responsibility” as a heading, companies often use specific terms to identify various CSR initiatives. The purpose of this article is to identify common CSR-related headings that are currently used on Fortune 500 company websites. Data were collected from all Fortune 500 company websites. The websites were further analyzed according to manufacturing, retailing, and service industry. Interesting similarities and differences were found. This study provides guidance on articulating CSR-related activities to consumers, employees, and stakeholders."

To determine if the business school at a small comprehensive university provides sufficient intercultural communication training, feedback from two surveys and an interview with the international business (IB) coordinator were analysed. Results revealed that the business school has implemented a multicomponent IB concentration, but that business language initiatives were unsustainable because of inadequate administrative commitment. Thus, efforts directed at internationalising the curriculum fail unless they are fully integrated into all programs and engage all stakeholders."

The research analyzed all syllabi of FOB courses offered in the spring 2010 semester for evidence of WAC looking for indications of writing activities. The analysis focused on both expressive/informal and product/formal writing and discovered through the syllabi the intention of the instructor to incorporate writing. The findings suggest that these courses require little or no writing and therefore principles of WAC are not evident.

This article considers the curricular implications of the growing business uses of virtual world technology through three different lenses—students as employee-users, students as strategic designers and decision makers, and students as theorists. The instructor’s approach to communication principles relevant to persistent virtual worlds should be grounded in current and anticipated business applications. Emerging business practice provides guidance regarding the communication principles and skills that might be required of students entering careers in a contemporary business world of networked, digitized, and virtually enhanced communication."

The newest of the four generations in the workplace, Millennials, were recently shown to have different values than the other two prevalent generations. Surveys taken by 16,000 high school seniors of three generations on intrinsic, extrinsic, social, leisure, and altruistic values at work show only the altruistic value is not statistically different. When aggregated, these generational differences have noticeable practical impact. In the classroom, engagement is essential to learning. Examples of engaging activities that address the Millennials’ values are provided."

However, we see little evidence of the pedagogical practice, the use of personal reflective writing exercises, in the teaching of business communication. This article looks at pedagogy and theory that informs the use of personal, reflective writing exercises in composition and management and suggests the relevance of these same practices in business communication classrooms today. Building on relevant pedagogical theory and practice, the author also makes the claim that personal reflective writing exercises can make students better writers and more effective managers and leaders. The article concludes with sample exercises that readers might try in their own business communication classrooms."

Based on the analysis of ethnographic studies on hunter-gatherer and modern work organizations, this article claims that storytelling, as an adapted cognitive device, was selectively retained by natural and sexual selection, because of its survival and reproductive payoff. The narrative production through storytelling is a natural coping mechanism and has been functional in both old and new ways of working life under different ecological conditions. This article also highlights underlying adapted psychological mechanisms of storytelling and discusses some evolutionarily informed practical implications and pedagogical applications."

The goal of writing instruction in business communication classes is to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully meet future writing challenges. However, many writers struggle to transfer skills and knowledge from one context to another. The primary reason for this struggle is that despite years of writing instruction, most people are highly apprehensive about writing and do not consider themselves “writers.” Writing instruction typically does little to lessen writing apprehension, but fostering writing self-efficacy can both diminish writing apprehension and further writing development."

In response, we engage in a two-study approach. Study 1 explores the potential of graphic novels to affect learning outcomes and finds that the graphic novel was related to high levels of learning experiences. Study 2 compares the impact of graphic novels with that of traditional textbooks and finds that verbatim recognition was superior with graphic novel texts. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive examination of the graphic novel as a tool for effective business communication."

This article recommends changing these practices so that writers can prepare one résumé for both paper and electronic delivery. These recommendations focus on three areas. Résumés should be formatted based on eye-tracking research about on-screen reading. Specific guidelines should help writers decide when to include an objective or summary. Keywords should be prioritized over active verbs. Last, résumés still must be formatted for paper but designing for on-screen reading is now equally or more important, and best practices need to reflect this change."

Fall, Stephanie Kelly, Patrick MacDonald, Charles Primm, Whitney Holmes","Given the expanding globalized workforce, business educators continue to seek new ways to prepare students for intercultural encounters. Although immersion in other cultures is the optimal strategy, this method is not always feasible. As such, educators seek other mechanisms to simulate intercultural experiences. This study examines emotional intelligence as a predictor of intercultural communication apprehension among university students (N = 425). Results indicate that three of the emotional intelligence subscales predict intercultural communication apprehension: emotionality, sociability, and self-control. These results support the premise that emotional intelligence manages and/or reduces intercultural communication apprehension and therefore should be integrated in business curriculum."

The findings come from two of our recent research studies: an open-ended survey of 204 employees at a beverage distributor on the East Coast and a nationwide, random-sample survey of 350 business professionals in the United States. There were significant differences by age, group, gender, region, and income level. The differences between women and men were quite striking, with men nearly twice as likely to consider various mobile phone behaviors as acceptable in informal meetings."

A fresh review of voice assessment in light of recent technological developments strongly suggests that this form of review is now ready for broad adoption. Favorable student reception of voice assessment and its potential for raising instructor awareness around the review process itself argue further for considering it afresh."

However, current methods used to teach teamwork have been met with mixed results from both students and educators. This article integrates research on the importance of teamwork, team development processes, and coteaching through examining a case study wherein coteaching was used as a means of conveying teamwork concepts to students. Coteaching is an alternate approach to teaching teamwork skills. In this case, the core competencies of shared values, complementary expertise, and the willingness to experiment were critical to forming and developing a functional teaching partnership."

Benoit, Anne Czerwinski","Faced with a crisis, what can a business say? Crisis communication literature tends to focars on what to do before and after a crisis and on the kinds of crises corporations face. Less attention is given to the options available within mes sages about a crisis. The theory of image restoration provides a useful key to composing such messages. This article applies the theory to one case study in image repair discourse: USAir's response to media coverage of the crash of one of its aircraft in Pittsburgh in 1994. Introducing such case studies in the classroom helps students to understand the basic tenets of persausion in the highly charged context of repairing a corporate reputation after an attack."

The challenge facing consul tants is how to train employees to be competent listeners. Although much research in listening has taken place over the last few years, little of that research addresses workplace listening directly and much is based on false assumptions: that listening is a unitary concept, that listening is a cognitive rather than behavioral skill, and that listening is a linear act. In a 10-year study, we developed a model of organizational listening competency that does apply directly to the workplace. It provides a basis for assessing listening abil ity largely through the observations of co-workers. The model emphasizes two effective behaviors: accuracy, that is, confirming the message sent; and sup port, that is, affirming the relationship between the speaker and the listener: This model serves as an effective basis for improving workplace listening, both through fo..."

The results indicate that CMC encouraged students to become active learners and to contact instructors. Anecdotal evi dence suggests that e-mail helps African-American students to see instructors as facilitators, though it does not necessarily become a rhetorical ""safe house,"" where students engage in vernacular discourse. Nevertheless, e-mail fosters an informal rhetorical relationship that rewards openness and collaboration among students and instructors within the formal academic setting."

DuFrene, William Sharbrough, Tim Clipson, Miles McCall","Outdoor challenge education has gained a dedicated following since its inception in the 1940s. Outdoor programs provide a framework for organizations to improve teamwork, problem solving, risk-taking, self-esteem, and interpersonal communi cation. The advantages of outdoor-based programs include high participation in learning by trainees, opportunity to experience real emotions and adopt new pat terns of thinking, ability to promote experimentation in problem solving, and pro motion of group awareness and trust. Many advantages of outdoor education can be maintained when a program goes indoors. Indoor adaptations are safe and nondiscriminatory; they can be conducted anywhere regardless of weather, can facilitate easier transfer of learning to the workplace, and are less expensive. Using the outdoor model, teachers can devise challenge activities for classroom use. Such activities provide variety and the opportunity for experiential learning in the busi ness communication classroom."

Karuppan, Muthu Karuppan","A recent study showed that Web-based materials enhanced teaching and learning in an introductory operations management course. Evidence gained from the study provides the basis for several guidelines concerning the early stages of implementing such a course. Faculty should understand why students visit the Website, time the availability of materials to match usage patterns, and provide information in appropriate detail and in an appropriate format. The Website facilitated students' note taking and studying, enhanced class discussion, and aided retention; it did not encourage students to miss class, as some faculty feared. Students tended to print out materials from the site, so that printing costs for courses were not reduced, just transferred from an academic department to the computer lab or the students. While traditional ""chalk and talk"" approaches will continue in the short term, students will increasingly see such an approach as outdated and find the Web their instructional medium of choice."

The university business communication curriculum is filled with topics that lead to improving communication skills. A per centage of students find some topics to be boring, unimportant, intimidating, and/or nonessential. However, other students find these same topics to be interest ing, significant, challenging, and vital. For example, college students fear giving oral presentations more than writing papers. Could the preference or the abhor rence of various business communication topics be related to personality type? To answer this question, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), combined with a Likert Scale, was used to study the relationship between business communication students' personality types and their preferred topics in business communication."

To support such teaching, all the textbooks we've seen discuss style at this level, usually in a chap ter on the topic, with additional discussion within other chapters dedicated to spe cific types of messages. We are hopeful but not certain about the impact of this instruction on the quality of our students' future writing. To measure that impact in at least a small way, we gathered empirical data in a single classroom of busi ness communication students. A panel of three writing specialists and three non- specialists rated holistically the quality of informative memos written by undergrad uate business students before and after instruction. In addition, three panelists analyzed the style of the memos. The memos written after instruction were of higher quality than those written before instruction.

Such reviews can profit from two computer applications: news groups and specialized communication client software. In a recent survey, a majority of the students who conducted peer reviews in a business writing class found the activities useful and worthy of repeating in future semesters. But they suggested that faculty provide more guidelines and topics to enhance the substance of the review, train students more directly in the computer applications, and allot more time to conduct the reviews at a comfortable pace."

It investigates the work and communication needs of newly graduated auditors, their senior colleagues, and their managers in five MNCs (multinational companies ) in Sin gapore. Much research indicates that accountancy graduates entering the profession are perceived to be lacking some important communication abilities. This study investigates how important auditors perceive interpersonal, oral, and written skills to be to them at different stages of their professional careers and the degree to which they perceive that they need to improve in these skills. As expected, the newly graduated audit assistants perceived the greatest need for improvement in all three skills. However, they also per ceived that written skills were of lesser importance to them than interpersonal and oral skills. We suggest that accounting courses could prepare undergraduates more effectively in the oral/interpersonal skills needed in the initial stage..."

Erik Timmerman, Volker Frank, Laura Quinn","Communication audits serve well as educational tools for both student auditors and employees of organizations. To use audits, teachers need to gain access to organizations, especially through internal audit departments; negotiate the exchange of essentially free audit findings for a learning experience and research data; and secure commitment from top management, other organizational mem bers, and student auditors. To administer the audit itself, teachers should start with a pilot audit followed by full assessment, conduct a two-phase process of data collection and analysis that includes questionnaires and interviews, and report findings in a timely and effective manner. The promises of the approach outweigh its inevitable perils."

Students reported on interactions in a year-long workplace-focussed group communication project, comparing these with interactions on other academy-based group assignments. Differences were seen in the amount of brainstorming, the criteria for dividing up work, the intensity of editing, and how conflict was managed. Contributing factors to these differences included the presence or absence of a creative element, the instrumental nature of the task, and the need for a collective approach inherent in the task design."

In the study, 276 participants working in various industries completed measures of communication competence and leadership styles about their direct supervisor along with measures of their job satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment. As predicted, effective and appropriate communication were both positively related to satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment. Furthermore, task- and relations-oriented leadership styles were both positively related to all three employee outcomes as well. Finally, regression analysis determined that effective communication and relations-oriented leadership were the best predictors of satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment."

Bean","Our assessment research suggests that quantitative business courses that rely primarily on algorithmic problem solving may not produce the deep learning required for addressing real-world business problems. This article illustrates a strategy, supported by recent learning theory, for promoting deep learning by moving students gradually from “well-structured” algorithmic problems with single correct answers to “ill-structured” real-world business problems that may have multiple correct answers and require an argument addressed to a specific audience. We show how these scaffolded communication assignments promote deep learning, and suggest ways that interested faculty can adapt the assignments to their own courses."

Why presenters use PowerPoint in this way has not been studied so far. Our study using interviews with beginning and advanced presenters shows that some use the program as a speaking note and as a means to draw the attention away from themselves. Some even think that PowerPoint can replace rhetorical skills. Slides are mainly designed on the basis of commonsense, instead of guidelines based on human information processing. Implications for the teaching of PowerPoint use in business communication are discussed."

We developed and tested the efficacy of a cueing tool—Scribe Bene—to help students reduce their use of imprecise and ambiguous words and wordy phrases. Effectiveness was measured by comparing cue word usage between a treatment group given the tool and a control group without the tool. In written assignments, the treatment group used 16 of 23 cue words significantly less than the control group and this effect persisted over time. Implications for using automated cueing tools in teaching written communication skills are discussed."

It describes a preclass assignment for a meeting and negotiation skills course, in which students are instructed to observe an authentic business meeting, interview participants of the meeting, photograph the boardroom, draw a sketch of the seating arrangement, and write a reflective account. Its main argument is that immersion in corporate culture before class makes business communication training not only more authentic but also produces richer in-class discussions, ultimately leading to a level of metacognition associated with deep learning."

Chory","The present study examines instructors’ attempts to increase student satisfaction through what we predict to be destructive communication tactics. Results indicate that business majors reported being more likely to engage in incivility and academic dishonesty in courses taught by professors who attempted to gain student favor through gossiping, self-disclosure, and downward convergence. Furthermore, perceptions of the instructor’s ethical character mediated the relationships between instructor behaviors and student incivility. Given the centrality of the professor in developing future managers and employees, we discuss implications for business and professional education and advocate for a return to a more traditional business professor role."
http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2329490616676576,Gamification in the Business Communication Course,Jennifer R. Veltsos,"Interest in gamification in higher education has been growing steadily in the past decade. Using games and game elements has been shown to increase student engagement, motivation, and autonomy. This article draws parallels between game elements, instructional design, and the teaching of business and professional communication. It suggests ways that teachers can incorporate game elements into their courses (or perhaps identifies ways in which readers are already doing so without realizing it). The article concludes with an example of how game elements are used in the design of an introductory business communication course."
http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2329490616677045,Enhancing Student Learning Through Scaffolded Client Projects,Elizabeth Tomlinson,"This article reports on the current status of client projects (CPs) in business communication courses, provides a scaffolded model for implementing CP, and assesses student learning in CPs. Using a longitudinal mixed method research design, survey data and qualitative materials from six semesters are presented. The instructor survey indicated need for a model for CPs, assistance identifying community partners, and advice on tailoring CPs to course objectives, all of which are provided here. Results from assessing the model’s application indicate that students expressed higher levels of confidence as communicators and felt better prepared to engage in workplace communication."
http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2329490616680360,Modified Immersive Situated Service Learning,Natasha N. Jones,"Distinctions between traditional service learning and critical service learning with a social justice focus are important when structuring professional writing courses and defining course outcomes. This article presents a hybrid pedagogical approach for designing a critical service-learning course that integrates a social justice curriculum while focusing specifically on reflection, context, and positionality. Detailing the course design and sharing reflections from students and the instructor, the author argues that the modified immersive situated service-learning approach provides professional communication students the opportunity to become agents of change."

Witte,"Free online survey tools provide a practical learning-by-induction platform for business communication instructors interested in trying out an advanced multidisciplinary survey activity coupled with an innovative teaching design. More than just building skills in marketing, survey projects marshal a wider set of thinking and doing activities that build student competency in the interrelated disciplines of communication, consumer analysis, and research. The design and sequence of a survey-learning module are outlined as well as expected learning outcomes, assessment considerations, and suggestions for exploring the interdisciplinary opportunities that surveys afford."

Survey findings included female students reporting higher levels of anxiety than their male counterparts on four of the five scales. Results suggest that additional training for female applicants could reduce anxiety levels and help them excel in job interviews. Implications for job applicants, academic communities, and recruiters are discussed. The article concludes with study limitations and suggestions for future research."

Companies are expanding their CSR activities and making the terminology used to describe them more specific. This study compares website content of Fortune 500 companies in 2015 with content collected in 2011. Traditionally, two CSR issues have been the dominant focus on company websites: community and environment. Findings reveal that these terms have decreased in usage and new terms have emerged, such as supply chain and volunteer involvement. A shift has occurred that business practitioners will find helpful in communicating CSR initiatives."

This case study reviewed four classes from two different midsized universities whose classes range from 48 to 300 students. Findings suggest that, when faced with the possibility of teaching more students, it is important to understand that pedagogical strategies may need to be adjusted to maintain student learning. These strategies include modifying the course to the lecture/lab structure, limiting the amount of writing, or allowing the instructor to teach fewer courses."

The study examines three technical and professional online writing courses: one course that employs small groups and group moderators and two courses that have no small groups or moderators. The results of this study show that the amount of interaction between students in online writing courses increases dramatically by incorporating small groups and peer moderators.

Smith,"Expectancy violations theory, a communicative framework, is applied in this study to understand how recent college graduates form, evaluate, and respond to violated job-searching expectations. In-depth interviews of college seniors (N = 20) who were currently job searching helped answer the three research questions posed. Using a thematic analysis, the findings indicate that young job seekers evaluate some negative information positively because it reduces their uncertainty and that expectations and responses to expectancy violations change over time and are not stagnant, as the theory originally predicted. Other contributions, limitations, and teaching implications are discussed."

Petre, Elizabeth A. Petre","This article presents findings from a rhetorical analysis of job advertisements posted by the fastest growing companies in the United States (Inc. 5000 rankings). The analysis suggests that companies rely on standard rhetorical figures and share similar rhetorical visions of novelty that likely effect their organizational culture, paradoxically make them homogeneous, and potentially oversell positions that require prosaic job duties. Suggestions to authors of job advertisements include writing with fewer clichés and metaphors, since they tend to reify ageist stereotypes. Suggestions for job seekers include doing rhetorical analyses of advertisements and writing résumés so they comply with job advertisements’ creative rhetorical styles."

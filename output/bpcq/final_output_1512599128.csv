Chinese Cultural Values and Performance at Job Interviews: a Singapore Perspective,"Irene F. H. Wong, Lai Phooi-Ching","In a country like Singapore, which is rated high in power distance and low in indi vidualism (using Hofstede's dimensions of national cultures), interviews for entry- level positions in multinational corporations (MNCs) may reveal subtle clashes in culture. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed transcripts of job interviews involving nine English-speaking applicants from Chinese backgrounds and two experienced interviewers from Anglo-American MNCs in Singapore. Our assumption was that a person's cultural background and upbringing influence his or her perform ance at job interviews. The findings reveal that Chinese applicants tend to defer to the interviewer (i.e. superior) and focus on the group or family, besides being averse to self-assertion. Hence, applicants from a Chinese background may be dis advantaged when being interviewed for jobs with MNCs which are heavily influ enced by Anglo-American culture."
Ethical Preferences among Business Leaders: Implications for Business Schools,"Roger N. Conaway, Thomas L. Fernandez","Since 1976, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) has encouraged business schools to include ethics in their curricula. Because lan guage is the means for conveying values, including ethical values, business com munication faculty play an important role in deciding what should be taught, and how. But until very recently, most researchers failed to look specifically at actual practices and perceptions in the workplace. To address that need, we conducted a survey of 250 business leaders concerning their ethical preferences and compared our results with an earlier study of business faculty and students. The survey, adapted from one used in the Arthur Andersen Business Ethics Program, consists of 20 narratives which presented respondents with the need to judge the impor tance of certain issues and their approval or disapproval of the action or decision described. We found no significant differences in responses to the 14 items which addressed ethical issues in such areas as creating ..."
Computer Conversations and Writing Apprehension,Mark Mabrito,"As participants in a growing number of online business writing courses, students must communicate with each other and the instructor electronically. One group of students may face particular challenges in this environment: those with high degrees of writing apprehension. This study examined the online communications behavior of such students as they communicated with both familiar and unknown audiences via Internet newsgroups. Low-apprehensive writers tend to exhibit simi lar communication strategies in both types of newsgroups. But high-apprehensive writers contributed more, initiated more topics of discussion, and felt more com fortable participating in electronic discussions with unknown audiences than they did when communicating with familiar audiences."
Adapting an American-based Simulation to a Hong Kong Classroom,"Bertha Du-Babcock, Richard D. Babcock","Case studies tend to embed the language and values of the culture in which they are created. To use an American-based behavioural simulation, Looking Glass Inc., in Hong Kong, we needed to adapt it to the students' language environment and proficiency, their culturally derived behaviours, and their understanding of the context of American business. In Hong Kong, the norms prescribing language use are complex and contradictory; English is a major business, government, and legal language, but Cantonese and sometimes Mandarin have a continuing presence, especially in oral communication. The English in the simulation, however, reflect ing the authors' emphasis on realism, included slang and idiomatic expressions that were confusing even to students otherwise fluent in the language, and thus we had to modify materials to aid comprehension. We also had to adjust our administra tion of the materials to account for cultural differences between the individualistic and low power distance dimensions of the American ..."
The Key Role of Listening in Business: A Study of the Singapore Insurance Industry,"Valerie Priscilla Goby, Justus Helen Lewis","We tend to regard listening as a passive, automatic process that just happens rather than as a skill that is essential for good communication. Yet in reality effective lis tening is a skill that needs to be developed as a prerequisite for successful practice of the more 'active' skills of speaking and writing. The insurance industry is a prime example of an industry that relies heavily on good listening skills for effective marketing. We conducted a study in Singapore of how listening is perceived by people involved in insurance. We found that more experienced people were well aware of its key role although students majoring in insurance believed speaking was more important. This study confirms earlier research: in the insurance indus try in Singapore there is a gap between the perceived need for good listening and the degree to which good listening skills are perceived to be possessed by insurance agents."
A Strategic Consultancy Model for Establishing a Center for Business Communication,"Shirley Kuiper, Martha W. Thomas","As a result of a major revision of the undergraduate curriculum in the Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina, we were given the task of establishing a center for business communication. Based on this experience, we present our strategic consultancy model for launching such a center. The model employs the strategic management paradigm of identifying the principle players in the process; identifying stakeholders; defining goals; analyzing strengths, weak nesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis); establishing consultancy relationships; and evaluating results. The model proved successful in writing a proposal for the center, implementing the center, and evaluating the center's work."
Professionals and Professors: Substance or Style?,"Srivatsa Seshadri, Larry D. Theye","To determine what aspects of writing are most important in a business context, previous researchers have often surveyed business professionals as well as business faculty. We recently took a different approach. We asked business professionals to critique and evaluate a set of writing samples. We then asked business faculty to evaluate the same samples, and we analyzed the results from the two groups. We found that professionals judge writing on different criteria than do faculty. While both groups emphasize organization, professionals also emphasize wording/style, content, and sentence structure more than do faculty, who emphasize conciseness, spelling/grammar, appearance, and purpose. In addition, professionals are signifi cantly more lenient in assigning grades than are faculty and spend less time in evaluating the writing. In general, business professionals judge papers more on substance (content) and less on style (mechanics) than do business faculty."
Perception is the Thing: Presenting Variant Worldviews in the International Business Communication Classroom,Mohan R. Limaye,"Two assumptions underlie the teaching of international business communication. First, perceptual variations exist within a country, and they sharpen even more across countries and cultures. International business communication students need to be aware of such differences on substantive issues. Second, critical pedagogy maintains that making students think and revisit their worldviews through an encounter with discomforting or decentering ideas is a valuable teaching and learn ing tool. Exposing students in my class to controversial propositions caused them to demonstrate a gamut of reactions from agreement and disagreement to anger, pity, disbelief, and a sense of discovery."
Using Experiential Learning Theory and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator in Teaching Business Communication,"Valerie Priscilla Goby, Justus Helen Lewis","As more emphasis is placed on groupwork in business environments, management students need to be aware of the psychological underpinnings of communication. They also benefit from understanding how people learn because they are likely to have to incorporate such understanding when, as managers, they implement orga nizational change. Moreover, they have to become life-long learners themselves as they adapt to new business environments. Business communication classes can perform an important role in preparing students to meet these challenges by intro ducing them to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Kolb's experiential learning cycle."
Writing Across the Accounting Curriculum: An Experiment,"Diane A. Riordan, Michael P. Riordan, M. Cathy Sullivan","To improve the writing skills of accounting students, we developed a structured writing effectiveness program across three junior level courses in the accounting major: tax, cost, and financial accounting. Writing counted for approximately five percent of the grade in each course and accounting professors discussed grammar, sentence structure, and word choice. A consulting expert on writing also con tributed to the program. We tested the results of our program empirically through both a pretest/posttest design and a control/treatment group comparison. The results provide evidence that our writing across the curriculum project significantly improved the students' writing skills."
How Classroom Environment and Student Engagement Affect Learning in Internet-based MBA Courses,J.B. Arbaugh,"While the number of college courses being delivered via the Internet is increasing rapidly, our knowledge of what makes these courses effective learning experiences for students is still limited. Therefore, I conducted a study that examined the effects of technological, pedagogical, and student characteristics on student learn ing in Internet-based MBA courses. Of these characteristics, I found that only those reflecting instructor efforts to create an interactive classroom environment were significantly associated with student learning. Other characteristics such as the perceived ease of use of the course software package, the perceived flexibility of the online classroom environment, and the amount of time students spent logged onto the course Website were not significantly associated with student learning. These findings suggest that while some level of technological sophistication may be important, teaching expertise may be the primary criterion for teaching success in the online classroom environment..."
Differences in American and British Vocabulary: Implications for International Business Communication,James Calvert Scott,"American English and British English vocabularies have diverged over time, result, ing in lexical differences that have the potential to confound English-language intercultural communication. The differences derive from the need to adapt the meanings of existing expressions or to find new expressions for different things and to borrow expressions from different cultures. Separation and slow means of com munication also cause differences and encourage one side to retain archaic expres sions that others have abandoned or modified. The differences in vocabulary can be grouped into four categories: the same expression with differences in style, con notation, and/or frequency; the same expression with one or more shared and dif ferent meanings; the same expression with completely different meanings; and dif ferent expressions with the same shared meaning. These differences in vocabularies affect understanding of all varieties of English. To bridge differences in Enghsh language vocabularies, international busi..."
Interpersonal Communication for Police Officers: Using Needs Assessment to Prepare for Skeptical Trainees,Marilyn J. Woods,"The philosophy of community policing emphasizes interpersonal communication skills for police officers. However, trainee police officers may be wary of training conducted by someone outside of law enforcement. This article lends support for using a needs assessment that helps trainers overcome organizational and personal boundaries in such a training class. In teaching interpersonal communication for groups of 8 to 12 police officers in two-hour training sessions, I learned that strate gically using the results of a needs assessment could encourage trainees to have a vested interest in the class and help the trainer feel competent and comfortable."
Building Knowledge Structures in Teaching Cross-cultural Sales Genres,Zhu Yunxia,"Approaching genres as knowledge structures provides a useful theoretical basis for teaching students to communicate across cultures. The approach is based on the concept of schemata (Rumelhart, 1980; Cook, 1994) and on Swales's (1990) techniques for genre analysis. It is divided into four interrelated teaching stages: background information, communicative purposes, text structure, and the implica tions of genre comparisons. Among the four stages, teaching the communicative purposes is the most important. This approach has been used effectively to teach students how to write sales letters in English and Chinese."
Internet Recruiting in the Banking Industry,"C. Glenn Pearce, Tracy L. Tuten","The Internet has brought about changes in the job search and application process. For this article, recruiters at several large commercial banks in the US were inter viewed on the usage of Internet recruiting tools. The interviews identified a number of trends that are fairly uniform across these banks, including the following:1. Recruiters are using the Internet at an increasing rate.2. While job site services are popular, most recruiters we interviewed preferred using the corporate Website.3. The percentage of Internet-recruited applicants actually hired varies widely and is still a small percentage of the whole.4. Diversity programs are not hampered by Internet recruiting."
Self-observation in Teaching: what to Look for,Larry Robbins,"Instructors who want to improve their teaching often do not know how to identify the changes they need or want to make. This article offers practical suggestions on course planning and class preparation, effective communication, questioning and responding, assessment and evaluation. The focus is on providing a method of observing the process of teaching and learning. If teachers know how to observe themselves, they can more easily establish a personal style that motivates their students."
Getting Up to Speed on the Information Highway: Integrating Web-based Resources into Business Communication Pedagogy,"Thomas D. Clark, Sherrie E. Human, Heidi Amshoff, Mike Sigg","Building on student and faculty enthusiasm for Web resources, we addressed four significant questions as we revised a business communications class to incorporate the Internet:• What Web resources should we include?• How do we make sure we select high quality sites and assessment tools?• How do we effectively integrate Web tools with existing pedagogies?• Will students find Web assignments valuable, easy to access, and useful for course assignments?We integrated Web resources with other course pedagogies in the undergraduate business communications class and identified Websites relevant for teaching employment communication, including e-mail etiquette, online resumes, and elec tronic job searches. Student evaluations of our Web-enhanced course indicate that most found the Web-based assessments and tools accessible and valuable in fur thering their self-understanding and in leading them to explore other sites not required for class. We developed guidelines for using the new technology to support teaching a..."
Working in Groups: identification and Treatment of Students' Perceived Weaknesses,"Nancy M. Schullery, Melissa K. Gibson","The ability to work in groups is vital for today's workforce, yet the existence of the necessary skills among students is questionable. Although group activities are now common, specific classroom instruction in effective group participation skills is not. Moreover, students recognize the need for such instruction. Content analysis of students' self-descriptions identified ten categories of deficiencies: conflict avoidant, public speaking anxiety, leadership, shy, oral skills, lack motivation, brainstorm ing, impatient,-intolerant, dislike groups. These weaknesses were addressed by a vuriety of pedagogical exercises including individual presentations, type or tem perament identification, an enhanced understanding of argument and brainstorm ing, and ways to encourage substuntive, but not procedural or affective, conflict. Student-perceived improvements were found in all categories, with the largest improvement in public speaking anxiety."
A Historical Review of Business Communication Quarterly,Stephen D. Lewis,"Since the inception of its predecessors in the 1930s, Business Communication Quarterly has evolved from a duplicated, newsletter-type publication into a glossy, professional, refereed journal. During this evolution, hundreds of authors and more than a dozen editors have contributed to BCQ's progress. Articles on a broad variety of topics have provided pedagogical support to new and experienced teachers alike. Presented here is a brief history of BCQ, a glimpse at BCQ's most popular manuscript topics, and a listing of its editors and most prolific authors. Frequency of topical coverage by decade is also included. Veteran ABC members and new members alike should find interesting the topical publishing trends throughout the sixty-plus year history of the Association and the Business Communication Quarterly."
Instructor and Student Perceptions of What is Learned by Writing the Business Report,Kathleen M. Hiemstra,"In many business communication courses students must write a business report. This study compared what business communication instructors believe their stu dents learn and what writing skills they improve by completing the assignment with what students believe they learn and what writing skills they believe are improved. Data were gathered from members of the Association for Business Communica tion and from students who have completed a business report. Instructors see greater improvement in student writing skills than do students. To close this gap, faculty should offer more explicit explanations of the assignment and of the con cepts to be learned and the skills to be improved. They should also explain the cri teria for evaluation and help students assess their writing skills and set personal goals for improvement. Questionnaires are provided so instructors can compare their own perceptions with those of their students as well as with the instructors and students from this study."
"Toward a New Cartography of Intercultural communication: Mapping Bias, Business, and Diversity","Debashish Munshi, David McKie","Courses in intercultural communication often put non-Western students at a dis advantage. In developing a course with a majority of non-Western participants at The University of Waikato, we adapted critical pedagogy to address the Western biases in the texts and approaches of intercultural communication. We selected both mainstream and alternative readings that allowed students to connect the field's neo-colonial business present with its colonialist past, to question the ethics and efficacy of an often skewed territorialisation of knowledge; and to redress tra ditional distortions by introducing perspectives from a range of critical and post colonial theorists. The readings were reinforced by student presentations of their own experiences crossing cultural borders. These experiences were then assessed in class, so that we didn't rely on the simulated experiences recorded in the conven tional texts."
Peer versus Self Assessment of Oral Business Presentation Performance,"Kim Sydow Campbell, David L. Mothersbaugh, Charlotte Brammer, Timothy Taylor","Pedagogical practice related to oral business presentations has received little research attention despite the pervasiveness of oral presentations in business class rooms and their perceived importance to workplace success. This study collected data on three groups (self, peers, and instructor) to address four research ques tions related to (a) the usefulness of self and peer ratings as substitutes for instruc, tor evaluation of oral business presentations and (b) the relationship between vari ous content and non-content factors on overall perceptions of presentation quality. Data from this study suggest that (1) both holistic and analytical peer assessments are reasonable substitutes for instructor assessment when raters are trained; (2) self assessment does not closely reflect either peer or instructor assessments; and (3) peer assessment of delivery characteristics, command of material, and content strongly predict peer ratings of overall presentation quality."
"How Male, Female, and Mixed-Gender Groups Regard Interaction and Leadership Differences in the Business Communication Course","Janet K. Winter, Joan C. Neal, Karen K. Waner","Research on leadership and teams suggests that men and women exhibit different leadership and interpersonal communication styles. A review of literature and a survey of students in upper-level business communication courses at Central Mis souri State University provide evidence for five strategies to assist students in deal ing with team-interaction situations:1. Instruct students in techniques to avoid groupthink and to promote and handle competition2. Offer students ideas on and methods for reaching agreement in a timely manner3. Vary the subject of group writing assignments to allow each student to be per ceived as an expert4. Encourage all students to be active participants in the group process5. Emphasize the importance of good writing skills to both males and femalesFinally, further research is needed regarding the ""natural leader"" role, the role of competition in groups, and the effect of perceptions of tasks as either ""feminine"" or ""masculine."""
Cross-cultural Service Learning: American and Russian Students Learn Applied Organizational Communication,Betsy Stevens,"In an unusual cross-cultural endeavor, American and Russian students engaged in service learning as part of an organizational communication class in which they applied their skills to assist non-profit organizations. American students worked with a nursing home to plan a public relations event and the Russian students gave a party for children at an orphanage in Tomsk, Russia.Students worked in teams and accomplished assigned responsibilities. Both groups produced a public relations event and each contacted the press seeking news cover age. The Americans surveyed stakeholders about the effectiveness of the organiza tion's ability to communicate with its constituents. The Russians went about their project differently (they participated in the course online) ."
The Business of the Business Writing Center,Frank Griffin,"The question of how best to serve students in a business writing center leads to a consideration of the rhetorical relationship among students, writing center consult ants, teaching faculty, and employers in the students' professions. Most rhetorical models consider only the writing center as occupying the middle ground between students and teaching faculty. A revision of that model, one in which the writing center and teaching faculty share the middle ground, is more appropriate for a business writing center. Moreover, writing assignments best serve business student writers when students must situate themselves within the discourse community of a post-graduation employer. Instead of fostering an adversarial relationship, business writing centers function most effectively for students when the center complements the classroom faculty."
You-Attitude: A Linguistic Perspective,Lilita Rodman,"You-attitude is a pedagogically convenient cover term that subsumes considerable complexity, both with respect to the text effects it may include and the text charac teristics that create these effects. Some of the insights on politeness, tact, and def erence found in the work of Brown and Levinson, Leech, and Fraser and Nolen can help provide guidelines for assessing how important a you-attitude may be in writing about a particular real-world situation, and case grammar and information structure can inform strategies to enhance the expression of a you-attitude. Rather than being a binary variable, you-attitude appears to be gradable, and an infor mal student assessment of the you-attitude expressed in ten versions of the same passage suggests that the various strategies for enhancing the you-attitude conveyed by a text appear to have a cumulative effect, so that a greater sense of you-attitude is created when more strategies are used."
Writing Across the Curriculum in a College of Business and Economics,"Susan Plutsky, Barbara A. Wilson","A recent study examined how written communication concepts and skills have been integrated into core courses in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Northridge. Writing-across-the-curriculum programs have met with mixed success. We wanted to see how elements of such a program were working at our university. Through a survey of faculty, we found the pres ence of both formal and informal writing policies, differences in standards for writ ing in upper-division core courses, differences in assignments, differences in assess ment strategies and in the results of such assessments, and, finally, differences in perceptions about whether WAC is a good idea. In general, faculty do provide opportunities for students to write, but many feel students write poorly and thus can handle only easy assignments, and many faculty consider themselves ineffec tive teachers of writing. Based on this study we recommend the implementation of team-taught, interdisciplinary courses; the development ..."
How Instructor Immediacy Behaviors Affect Student Satisfaction and Learning in Web-Based Courses,J.B. Arbaugh,"In this study I investigated whether instructor classroom behaviors, called ""imme diacy behaviors,"" are significantly associated with student learning and satisfaction in Web-based MBA courses. Immediacy behaviors represent instructors' attempts to reduce the social distance between themselves and their students. While my study found that immediacy behaviors were positive predictors of student learning and course satisfaction, such other factors as student attitudes toward course soft ware, the length of a course, and prior student and instructor experience with Web-based courses were also significant predictors. These findings suggest that both structural characteristics of MBA programs and instructor behavior merit attention for Web-based courses to successfully deliver graduate management education."
Collaborative Peer Evaluation: Best Practices for Group Member Assessments,"Lisa E. Gueldenzoph, Gary L. May","As collaborative or team-based projects become more popular in both secondary and post-secondary classrooms, instructors are looking for ways for group mem bers to effectively evaluate one another. Constructing effective evaluation tools can be a daunting task. As shown by a review of literature, best practices include (1) building a foundation in the classroom that supports collaborative evaluation, (2) creating effective evaluation tools by articulating specific criteria and ensuring honest student participation (3) implementing formative feedback during the col laborative experience, (4) formulating summative feedback at the conclusion of the experience, and (5) assessing the collaborative evaluation process."
Showcasing the Skilled Business Graduate: Expanding the Tool Kit,"Janette Moody, Brent Stewart, Cynthia Bolt-Lee","To aid in selecting employees, recruiters use such tools as the interview, resume, academic portfolio, and videos. However, these tools are not equally effective in helping job candidates showcase specific skills during the hiring process. In a survey, we asked recruiters about the skills they seek in applicants and the best method for students to demonstrate those skills. The top five skills sought, not unexpectedly, are 1: communication (oral and written); 2. computer literacy; 3. interpersonal/social; 4. critical thinking/leadership (tied); and 5. teamwork. Recruiters still favored the resume and interview as methods for demonstrating these skills, but they also felt a portfolio was useful in providing evidence of these skills in context. None recommended video presentation. Based on this study, we suggest that instructors provide students with explicit instruction on developing resumes and portfolios and in performing well in interviews."
Health Care and the Silent Language of Vietnamese Immigrant Consumers,H. Rika Houston,"Cultural contexting has long been an established part of the business communica tion vocabulary. Each cultural group possesses a deeply embedded ""silent lan guage"" that requires attention and provides communication challenges. In the busi ness of health care, this silent language can create tremendous challenges for the physician/patient communication process, especially when the physician and patient come from starkly different cultural backgrounds, an increasingly common scenario. Through focus groups with recent Vietnamese immigrants, we identified three salient factors in this silent language: cultural health beliefs, time orientation, and the expected role of family members in the practice of health care. Business communication instructors need to incorporate these factors as they prepare administrators and practitioners to communicate well as health care professionals."
Language Training for Enhanced Horizontal Communication: A Challenge for MNCs,"Mirjaliisa Charles, Rebecca Marschan-Piekkari","Horizontal communication between subsidiaries of the same multinational corpo ration (MNC) is a Problem faced by staff as the demands for communicating across borders are pushed downwards in the organizational hierarchy. Although the choice of English as the common corporate language alleviates some of the hor izontal communication problems, it does not solve them all-particularly not when many subsidiaries are located in non-English speaking countries. In that situation, horizontal communication between subsidiaries can be a significant casualty.In a study of communication within a Finland-based MNC, Kone Elevators, interviews with staff globally revealed problems not only for non-native speakers, but also for native speakers of English. Illustrative interview data suggests that cor porate training schemes should focus on the broad spectrum of international com munication rather than on increasing a systematic knowledge of any one language."
Assessing Business Communication Assignments of English-as-Second-Language Students,"Stephen D. Lewis, Linda G. McGrew, C. Nathan Adams","As the US population becomes more diverse, the enrollment of English-as-Second- Language (ESL) students in colleges and universities continues to expand. This diversity may sometimes lead to problems for business communication teachers who must assess the written communication skills of students who may not be fluent in English. To address these problems, we conducted a nationwide survey of business communication teachers, soliciting input on how ESL students' written communication skills were assessed. Respondents were asked to identify areas where their assessments of ESL students might differ from their assessments of stu dents whose first language was English. Comparisons were made based upon teachers' gender, age, number of years of teaching experience, and geographic location where they teach. Although some grading leniency was shown toward ESL students in specific areas, generally the respondents indicated that they do not assess business communication assignments any differently based upon the stu..."
"converging within Divergence: Overcoming the Disciplinary Fragmentation in Business Communication, Organizational Communication, and Public Relations",Theodore E. Zorn,"As researchers, we often overstate the distinction between our own specialties and those fields that are clearly related. thus dismissing or ignoring research outside our specialties. Similarly, we too often fragment our teaching to focus on particular communication processes and competencies that fit our notions of what is appro priate for our chosen subdisciplines. Such fragmentation, however, diminishes our teaching and research. To overcome this problem, we should work toward struc tural realignments in our universities to encourage cross-disciplinary work; design majors around competencies, not departments; encourage coteaching to focus dif ferent perspectives on one case or example; encourage interdepartmental ""commu nication dialogues""; read a broad range of literature and work toward expertise in a topic, not just a discipline; attend other than just the usual conferences; and invite students to use a wide range of resources in solving problems."
Inbox Shock: A Study of Electronic Message Volume in a Distance Managerial Communication Course,"Jackie Hartman, Jeffrey S. Lewis, Karen Sterkel Powell","As institutions of higher education strive to serve students who are diverse and geographically dispersed, many of them are implementing distance education pro grams using technology-mediated communication. Research reveals that distance education is often as effective as traditional education; however, teachers and stu dents are confronted with a variety of obstacles. Thus educators need to determine the most effective and efficient methods of communicating with distance students. An examination of e-mail messages sent to the instructor of an MBA class by dis tance students reveals that the volume of messages sent depends on students' tech nology proficiency, ability to process and seek out information, topic affinity, and relational needs. Furthermore, the findings reveal that an instructor can decrease the volume of messages received by researching the student population, communi cating proactively, and taking advantage of the messaging system's tools."
Enhancing Collaborative Learning: Discussion Boards and Chat Rooms as Project Communication Tools,"Jacqueline K. Eastman, Cathy Owens Swift","Group projects are integral to the business curriculum and can be useful in devel oping students' skills and abilities as managers. However, fuculty encounter sev eral problerns with group projects, including assessing students' efforts, aiding good communication and coordination among members, and making sure the project is a truly collaborative effort. Technology may aid in addressing these problems; elec tronic discussion boards and chat rooms, for example, can help faculty and stu dents enhance collaboration and increase the accountability of group members."
Promoting Innovation in the Workplace: The Internal Proposal,Laura Reave,"Today's managers expect employees to be able to contribute not just their labor but also their analysis and ideas, yet little training is provided for writing the major document that contains such ideas: the internal proposal. Business and academic textbooks, as well as academic courses, focus almost entirely on external propos als, which are most appropriate in areas such as consulting and sales. The internal proposal (also known as the justification report), on the other hand, is applicable for almost any student's future career. It provides an opportunity for students to develop the competence and confidence to express their ideas in the workplace, encouraging them to demonstrate awareness and initiative, utilize problem-solving skills, and create a persuasive strategy. Because students are motivated to com plete this real-world assignment, it also inspires some of their best work."
Managing Communication within Virtual Intercultural Teams,Christine Uber Grosse,"As global companies increasingly rely on virtual teams to conduct short- and long- term projects, business students need to be prepared to manage the communication of intercultural teams. Communicating across cultures using technology can be a difficult task. It requires understanding the advantages and limitations of technol ogy and how to build relationships via technology. Virtual team members need to choose an appropriate communication channel for their purposes and be sure to balance distance work with face-to-face communication. Team leaders should encourage open communication and brainstorming, and avoid assignment of blame. Other strategies for success include: 1) develop a network of good relation ships built on trust and understanding, 2) show respect for other cultures and lan guages, and 3) understand how diversity strengthens the team."
Faculty Perceptions of Communication Skills and Needs of Business School Undergraduates in Singapore,Glenn Wharton,"In Singapore in 2000, the government launched a Speak Good English Movement to improve English language skills and to limit the use of Singlish (a local variety of English) by promoting the use of (Standard) English among the general popula tion. This campaign was motivated by govemment perception and media reports of a decline in English language skills.Using a 40-item questionnaire, this study investigated whether faculty at a large Singapore business school shared similar perceptions of inadequate communi cation skills, in this case among undergraduates, and also sought to explain their perceptions. The findings indicate that the faculty perceived undergraduate com munication skills to be in need of improvement, thus lending support to employer and government criticism. An analysis of survey responses revealed some probable underlying causes for faculty perceptions, including an apparent lack of real com mitment to the improvement of such skills."
Department Chairs' Perceptions of the Importance of Business Communication Skills,William J. Wardrope,"The purpose of this investigation was to determine business department chairs' rat ings of topics typically covered in the business communication course. A sample of 280 chairs provided administrative information about the business communication courses at their institutions, rated the importance of 34 topics typically covered in the course, and assessed the need for the course in their programs. Results indicate that department chairs perceive writing skills to be more important to business communication courses than other communication skills, such as speaking, tech nology-mediated communication, interpersonal communication, team/group com munication, listening, and cultural literacy skills. Implications for business com munication curriculum and research are offered."
Strengthen Your Business Communication Program with an Alumni Advisory Board,John M. Penrose,"Faculty, departments, and colleges are being pressured by state legislatures, boards of trustees, and re-accreditation organizations to assess themselves and their prod uct aggressively. Assessment may deal with demographics, such as number of stu dents per class; perceived quality, such as the nurnber of publications by faculty; or by outcomes, such as who hires the graduates and how well the graduates per form. External advisors are helpful in conducting such evaluations. One such group is an alumni advisory board, which can be established and operate with min imal effort and cost, yet can yield many benefits. The Alumni Board of the Infor mation and Decision Systems Department at San Diego State includes recent graduates nominated by faculty, is targeted at about 75 members, and is queried several times a year on issues related to curriculum, new topics of interest to the classroom, and job trends."
Consulting Course Design: Theoretical Frameworks and Pedagogical Strategies,"Elise J. Dallimore, Tasha J. Souza","Educators need to be more proactive in expanding course offerings to respond to the academic needs of university students. Draum by excellent pay and prospects of gaining valuable experience, more college graduates are pursuing employment in consulting. With consulting skills growing in importance for many of our students in the 21st century, business communication scholars are particularly well posi tioned to help students develop these requisite skills and knowledge. Offering a course dedicated to the topic of consulting, or including consulting experience in a standard business communication course prepares students for engaging in consult ing activities, including research, assessment, training and development, facilita tion, and evaluation. Our course foregrounds instructional frameworks and serv ice learning to assist students in systematically assessing organizational problems and designing and implementing organizational interventions."
Companies Can Apologize: Corporate Apologies and Legal Liability,"Ameeta Patel, Lamar Reinsch","Discussions of corporate apologies frequently state or imply that apologies create legal liabilities for the apologist and, therefore, that corporate attomeys routinely recommend against apologies. A review of formal (""black letter"") and common law indicates that apologies generally do not constitute evidence of guilt and that, in fact, they sometimes have positive consequences for the apologist. Persons who practice (or teach) crisis communication should avoid the mistake of relying on an over-simplified and inaccurate understanding of the legal issues surrounding corpo rate apologies."
Human Subjects Research by Business Students: Beyond the Red Tape,"Jill D. Jenson, Jo Mackiewicz, Kathryn Riley","Business communication faculty often assign projects that require students to interview, survey, or observe human subjects. Depending on the nature of the project and the policies at the faculty member's university, such projects may require prior approval by the university's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Therefore, business communication faculty will benefit from an understanding of three areas related to IRB review of class projects involving human subjects research: (1) whether their institution requires such class projects to be reviewed by the university's IRB and, if so, what form the review takes; (2) how they can adapt classroom activities, materials, and assignments so that human subjects research by students complies with IRB policies; and (3) how they can relate IRB policies to issues that students may face in their future professional lives."
Self-Imposed Silence and Perceived Listening Effectiveness,"Iris W. Johnson, C. Glenn Pearce, Tracy L. Tuten, Lucinda Sinclair","Thus far, listening training has been limited to lectures on the process of listening and experiential exercises designed to provide for practice in listening and for assisting in a person's ability to recognize his or her own beneficial and detrimental listening behaviors. Using a new process—silence—for developing listening skills, this study compared the effects on perceived listening effectiveness of a self- imposed period of silence versus attending a lecture on listening skills versus a combination of a self-imposed period of silence and attending a lecture. While no significant differences were found for either lecture or silence or the combination of the two on measures of perceived listening effectiveness, qualitative data from journals kept by the participants suggest that the act of self-imposed silence greatly improves awareness of one's listening effectiveness and the value of developing beneficial listening skills."
404 File Not Found: Citing Unstable Web Sources,Frank Griffin,"Researchers, including students, must accommodate to the mutating character of hyperlinks on the World Wide Web. A small study of citations in three volumes of BCQ demonstrates the phenomenon of ""URL rot,"" the disappearance of sites cited in the sample articles. Digital technology itself is now being used to create pockets of permanence, but with the understanding that preservation of content is only one ingredient in the mix of media and format migration. Databases like JSTOR offer digitally preserved copies of many scholarly journals. Online journals and search engines may offer their own archives. In general, researchers should cite digital articles in databases where possible and consider avoiding references to online journals with print editions."
Applying Distributed Learning Theory in Online Business Communication Courses,Kristin Walker,"Distributed learning theory is valuable for teachers of online business communica tion courses because it 1) highlights complexities of software tools, not only the online course interface, but also tools used to produce Websites, brochures, CDs, and other multi-media elements; 2) provides a way to address online communica tion dynamics, such as online chats and discussions, that students will practice in the workplace; and 3) allows teachers to examine how their previous experiences teaching business communication in more ""traditional"" classrooms affect teaching online. Highlighting these areas allows business communication teachers to focus on the critical use of technology in online formats that entail relatively new teach ing media. The critical application of technology use can be seen in areas like tool evaluation and use, power and divisions of labor, and community participation."
Helping Interviewees Tell Their Stories,"Steven M. Ralston, William G. Kirkwood, Patricia A. Burant","Employers' use of behavioral description interviews has increased dramatically within the past decade. Yet the pedagogical literature geared toward helping appli cants respond to these unique interviewing questions has not kept pace. Evidence shows that behavioral description questions require respondents to tell stories and that storytelling is now critical to applicants' success in employment interviews. We present criteria by which to judge the effectiveness of applicants' stories and demonstrate how business communication instructors might use these criteria to help applicants tell better stories. Specifically, the criteria presented in this article are : To what degree is a story internally consistent? To what degree is a story con sistent with facts the listener holds to be true? To what degree is a story relevant to the question asked and the claim being made? To what degree is a story univocal? To what degree does a story provide details that support the claim being made? How does the way a story ..."
Shared Teaching Models for Business Communication in a Research Environment,"Rosemary Booth, Melody Dixon-Brown, Gary Kohut","Shared teaching, also known as team teaching, is an innovative way to balance teaching and research. Shared teaching benefits students by providing the perspec tive of two or more professors in one class. Such an approach also benefits profes sors by giving them more concentrated time for their research. A review of the lit erature on the topic and examination of two distinct shared teaching models show that shared teaching has advantages and challenges for both faculty and students and is a viable option for reallocating resources."
Resume Writing and the Minority Student,"Barbara D. Davis, Clive Muir","writing is a difficult task for most job applicants, but minority students face unique challenges as they decide what information to present to a potential employer. A minority applicant's name, address, education, work history, extra curricular activities, and choice of references may trigger unfavorable assumptions by the reader and unfairly influence the selection process. To reduce the chances of ""detection"" and being eliminated prematurely, some minority students Anglicize their names, use street addresses of relatives and friends in more desirable parts of town, and downplay ethnic-specific education, jobs, and affiliations. Concealing one's ethnic background, however, may be difficult and, more important, may be counterproductive. Minority students should write resumes that are accurate and accentuate the achievements that a potential employer would focus on. Business communication instructors should address concerns about discrimination in selec tion and hiring as they help all students choose the..."
From Swoosh to Swoon: Linguistic Analysis of Nike's Changing Image,"Leslie A. Levin, Susan J. Behrens","Our research models one way in which linguistic theory can be applied to the study of business communication. Specifically, we use linguistic theory to analyze how Nike's image is created through internal and external forms of communication. We find a parallel use of positive images in communication created by both Nike and the media from the early 1980s to the late 1990s and a divergence of images when Nike is accused of labor violations. Introducing language analysis challenges busi ness students to assess carefully the structure of business communication in order to evaluate the reality behind the image."
Chinese Business Face: Communication Behaviors and Teaching Approaches,"Peter W. Cardon, James Calvert Scott","Chinese businesspersons are extremely sensitive to protecting and enhancing face. The Chinese sensitivity to face is a result of their emphasis on enduring relation ships and social networks. The hundreds of phrases in the Chinese language describing face demonstrate the sophistication of the Chinese conceptualization of face and related behaviors. For the businessperson, saving face and giving face are the most important face-related skills. Chinese businesspersons use various com munication strategies in order to save face and give face, including indirectness, intermediaries, praising, requests, and shaming. Western businesspersons can pre pare to operate effectively in the Chinese business environment by learning about the Chinese conceptualization of face and related communication strategies."
"From ""Acing the Test"" to ""Touching Base"": The Sports Metaphor in the Classroom","Evan H. Offstein, Christopher P. Neck","The use of sports metaphors to convey business lessons both within and outside the classroom is a common phenomenon. The sports metaphor, however, is prone to misuse and can often inadvertently exclude large segments of the student popula tion. To address these issues, we put forth an innovative and novel pedagogical approach that attempts to capitalize better on the shared meanings between athlet ics and certain business practices. Using the sports of tennis and basketball, we demonstrate how sports metaphors can he responsibly used to aid in the under standing of business lessons, such as managerial decision making."
English Business Communication Needs of Mexican Executives in a Distance-Learning Class,Christine Uber Grosse,"Many firms within and outside the United States operate in multilingual environments that require executives to do business in English as well as in other languages. Executives for whom English is a second language often face special challenges communicating in such settings. This study examines how 115 executives in a distance-learning business communication class in Mexico used English to conduct business and their perceived strengths and weaknesses in the language. Although most executives used English regularly at work and in their classes, many continued to have language problems. They cited vocabulary, writing, and grammar as critical areas to improve, followed by pronunciation and speaking. Their audiences consisted of native and nonnative speakers of English who faced their own language challenges. E-mail and phone were the most commonly used channels for English communication. The study results have implications for teaching international students in U.S. MBA and international executive programs...."
ABC Publications Award Winners for 2003,"Randolph Barker, Joo-Seng Tan, Mirjaliisa Charles, Ronald Dulek","“Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.”—Zora Neale Hurston (in Lewis, 2003)"
The Impact of Business Communication Education on Students’ Short- and Long-Term Performances,"Jensen J. Zhao, Melody W. Alexander","The purpose of this longitudinal study was to identify the short- and long-term impact of business communication education on students’ skill developments and performance outcomes. Nearly 400 students at an AACSC International–accredited business college participated in the study during their sophomore and senior years. The findings indicate that the business communication course helped students develop good skills in writing reports, solving problems, working in teams, communicating orally, and using Internet technologies for both the short term (sophomore year) and the long term (senior year). More than 95% of the students reported achieving As and Bs on written assignments, company-analysis reports, problem-solving assignments, and oral presentations in their sophomore, junior, and senior years. However, the long-term effect was statistically less significant than was the short-term effect, although both were within the same positive range."
The Instructor as Stagehand,"Wim Blokzijl, Roos Naeff","In this article, the authors present the results of a survey of students at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands concerning the students’ opinions about how PowerPoint should be used in university lectures. The most important outcome of the survey is that a vast majority of the respondents prefer a modest layout. Most students dislike sounds and animations in a slide show. Another outcome, however, is that audiences may be inclined to evaluate as positive any feature they were exposed to. Still, this apparent compliance does not mean that speakers can do whatever they like. Audience preferences do affect their evaluation of a lecture, and thus instructors should, as always, keep their audience in mind when they choose to use PowerPoint."
Two Approaches to Using Client Projects in the College Classroom,"Lynne Cooke, Sean Williams","Client projects are an opportunity for universities to create long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with businesses through an academic consultancy service. This article discusses the rationale and logistics of two models for conducting such projects. One model, used at Clemson University, is a formal academic consultancy service in which students are paid for their work with for-profit businesses. Another, used at the University of North Texas, also incorporates for-profit clients but operates in the more traditional classroom setting where student teams are not paid for their work. Whatever the approach, client projects facilitate communication between academia and business, enlist the services of professionals in a variety of fields to help shape the education of future graduates, offer opportunities for students to gain practical experience that surpasses any classroom simulation or case study, and keep instructors in touch with business trends and practices."
The Odyssey of Ph.D. Students Becoming a Community of Practice,"Annick Janson, Laurie Howard","Wenger’s theory of communities of practice (CoPs) helps explain how a group of Ph.D. students in the Department of Management Communication at the University of Waikato in New Zealand met a need for emotional and academic support and reduced isolation as they developed regular opportunities for face-to-face and virtual discussions on theory and technical and emotive issues. An analysis of this process makes three contributions to communities of practice scholarship: It documents “catalyzing” circumstances for CoP creation, places the Ph.D. quest in the context of existing CoP theory, and identifies a critical point that precedes CoP formation in the existing CoP model. Highlighting the shared experience of postgraduate students opens up opportunities for CoP formation that can help students emerge from isolation into a supportive peer community."
Activity Systems and Conflict Resolution in an Online Professional Communication Course,Kristin Walker,"Conflicts often arise in online professional communication class discussions as students discuss sensitive ethical issues relating to the workplace. When conflicts arise in an online class, the activity system of the class has to be kept in balance for the course to continue functioning effectively. Activity theory and distributed learning theory are useful for studying this process of conflict resolution and online communication. Several strategies can be used to facilitate conflict resolution in online courses, based on these theories: complimenting, generalizing, and agreeing. These normalizing strategies can improve conflict resolution in online professional communication courses as well as in various online communication contexts."
American and British Business-Related Spelling Differences,James Calvert Scott,"English language business-related documents around the world contain purposeful spelling differences that reflect two standards, American English and British English. Given the importance of culturally acceptable spelling, the need to be aware of and sensitive to cultural differences, and strong reactions to variation in spelling, it is important to understand the differences in these two spelling systems. Families of words that illustrate spelling practices draw attention to differences between the American and British spelling systems. Under at least some circumstances, business communicators should accommodate for spelling differences when communicating with those from other cultures. Implementing the presented teaching ideas based upon reacting, discussing, adapting, researching, and writing can clarify understanding of the American and British business-related spelling systems and help learners to prepare more culturally sensitive business documents when appropriate."
Global Partnerships in Business Communication,David Alan Sapp,"Many U.S. universities are developing interinstitutional partnerships in global business communication. Benefits include preparing students for the workplace by immersing them in intercultural projects and increasing the complexity of their understanding of the global economy. Challenges can range from technological constraints and scarce resources to geopolitical factors and varying disciplinary norms. However, global partnerships make faculty and students more aware of and engaged in the global business environment as they learn to communicate more effectively across cultures, critique current business practices, and produce new ways of being in global relation to each other. An interinstitutional partnership between a U.S. university and Universidad de la Habana in Cuba forms the centerpiece of discussion. Outcomes of this partnership include coauthoring articles in both countries and languages, the creation of a business communication course for graduate students in Cuba, and the development of classr..."
Multiple Roles in Responding to Strategic Communications,Wearing Trifocals,"Teaching communication to MBAs often involves focusing on corporate strategic discourse when student projects are intended to help companies move to a more advanced stage of development. This focus on corporate strategy—the language and concepts that concern the mission and direction that an organization should adopt—requires, in turn, that faculty enact several roles to assist students in developing their final assignments, strategic presentations, and reports. Faculty play the role of specialists in corporate strategy, communication specialists, and stand-ins for the primary audience(s) for these assignments. Working with students on these assignments underscores two important values in MBA education: providing students with the means to engage in discussion at the CEO level where decisions about the company’s strategic direction are made, and demonstrating to students that the strategic assignments they produce belong to a larger communication campaign for getting buy-in for corporate strategy. These t..."
Negotiating Differences in Learning and Intercultural Communication,Prue Holmes,"Research on ethnic Chinese students studying in a Western (New Zealand) learning environment exposed differences in communication and learning between their first culture and the host culture. Thirteen ethnic Chinese students in a New Zealand university business school participated in an 18-month ethnographic study. The findings indicate that these students were not prepared for the dialogic nature of classroom communication, which created difficulties in listening, understanding, and interacting. Written assignments embodied different expectations of writing styles, and understandings of critical analysis and plagiarism. The findings raise challenges for teachers in responding to difference rather than deficit approaches to teaching and learning, for ethnic Chinese students to be better prepared for the new learning environment, and for host institutions and local students to find ways of developing diversity awareness and appreciation."
Communication in Latin America,"Roger N. Conaway, William J. Wardrope","The format and structure of 150 Spanish-language letters written by business administrators in Guatemalan firms were analyzed to help determine how Latin American business writers organize and present information in various types of routine letters. Findings suggest that Latin American businesspeople follow some, but not all, of the format conventions typical of those used in the United States; that they tend not to use buffers to present bad news; and that they do not consistently place topic sentences at any particular part of business letters. Understanding the differences between U.S. and Latin American business communication practices as illustrated by this study should help instructors to prepare their students to communicate successfully with their future counterparts in all parts of the Western Hemisphere."
Implication versus Inference,Daphne A. Jameson,"The narrative concepts of the implied author and implied reader elucidate how business texts represent writers and readers. It is important, though, to distinguish carefully between writers’ implications and readers’ inferences. Instructors should contrast implied versus inferred writers and readers, provide multiple ways to comprehend these concepts, and illustrate them with examples (e.g., those provided in this article from Citigroup, Andersen, and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia). The meaning-as-event analytical method, from reader-response narrative theory, reveals specific language features through which business texts manifest readers and writers. To help writers plan and readers analyze such texts, instructors may use the teaching suggestions, sample assignments, prewriting heuristics, and evaluation criteria provided in this article."
Assessing and Teaching Competence,Terri Grant,"The Professional Communication Unit (PCU) at the University of Cape Town (UCT) recently conducted a business communication needs analysis to determine student perceptions of their communicative competence and the teaching strategies being used to develop such competence. Students felt that the specialist, stand-alone communication program was more effective than their 3 to 4-year degree per se in delivering communication instruction, but certain business fields (e.g., actuarial science) felt this more strongly than others (e.g., information systems). The implications are that expert tuition is essential and that a customized, more nuanced approach will ensure greater job literacy. Experiential teaching strategies that encourage student voice; workshop diversity; real-life scenarios; and supportive, scaffolding marking interventions will further consolidate skills development. In particular, communication teachers need to work with students and other stakeholders to deepen understanding of computer-mediate..."
A Comparison of Traditional and Technology-Assisted Instructional Methods in the Business Communication Classroom,"Diza Sauers, Robyn C. Walker","In their study of 261 students enrolled in eight sections of a business communication course, three taught in a traditional classroom setting and the others delivered in a hybrid, half-time online format, the authors found that all students measurably improved their writing skills. On another dimension of interest, however, students in the online hybrid course demonstrated a higher rate of active learning practices in their use of Blackboard course management software. Perhaps most important, online writing instruction yielded as significant levels of measurable improvement in writing as did instruction in a traditional classroom, provided that instructional materials corresponded to the particular needs of the students. These results are encouraging in indicating that online courses may provide the best form of course delivery for certain students and certain communication practices."
Assessing and Enhancing the Basic Writing Skills of Marketing Students,"Donald R. Bacon, Elizabeth Scott Anderson","Employers consistently rank communication skills, in particular writing ability, among the most important skills for undergraduate business students to possess. However, improving writing skills, especially with respect to punctuation, grammar, and word choice, often requires substantial teacher time and effort. To assess and improve student writing skills in a time-efficient manner, the authors developed a computer-scored measure of students’ ability to edit for writing mechanics. The authors tested the method with a pretest and posttest design and found that when students were held accountable for improvement (with 5% of the course grade dependent on improvement), there was a significant increase in students’ ability to edit. Without that accountability, improvement did not occur."
Strategies for Enhancing Student Interaction and Immediacy in Online Courses,"Roger N. Conaway, Susan S. Easton, Wallace V. Schmidt","The increased demand for Internet courses, especially in schools of business, has raised questions about instructional interaction and teacher-student immediacy, which online courses may lack. Because current research suggests immediacy behaviors may indeed be present, we developed a strategy for measuring immediacy in an online MBA course and related the results to student grades on final team projects in the course. Learner-to-learner, noncontent-related statements showed minimal affective behavior, but that lack did not have a negative effect on grades. The study suggests that students do not automatically provide supportive feedback, compliment each other, and express appreciation or agreement unless the instructor builds a learning community and transfers interactive roles to the students themselves."
A Multilanguage Online Writing Center for Professional Communication: Development and Testing,"Geert Jacobs, Liesbeth Opdenacker, Luuk Van Waes","An online writing center developed at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, called Calliope, provides a modular platform aimed at enhancing learners’ professional writing skills in five different languages: Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish. It supports courses in business and technical communication. The current version includes modules on press releases in English, business letters in French, and minute taking in Dutch. Unlike many online writing centers, it is genre-specific and context-specific, it is highly interactive rather than linear, it uses a process approach to cater to different learning styles, it accommodates different writer profiles, and it is an instructional tool not connected to a physical writing center."
Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALGains),"Gayle Vogt, Catherine Atwong, Jean Fuller",Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALGains) is a Web-based instrument for measuring student perception of their learning in a variety of courses. The authors adapted this instrument to measure students’ achieved proficiency in analyzing cases in an advanced business communication class. The instrument showed that students did achieve a high level of proficiency and that they did so equally in both traditional and online classes.
Educating European Corporate Communication Professionals for Senior Management Positions,Janis Forman,"UCLA’s program in strategic management for European corporate communication professionals provides participants with a concentrated, yet selective, immersion in those management disciplines taught at U.S. business schools, topics that are essential to their work as senior advisors to CEOs and as leaders in the field. The choice of topics represents the close collaboration between the directors of the UCLA and Lugano programs. The UCLA program also encourages the active participation of the professionals by offering an exposure to teaching and classroom communication practices of U.S. business schools that adhere to the case approach to business education and by providing numerous opportunities for participants to present their analyses and application of management topics to their professional roles and responsibilities. Working with European professionals also enables U.S. faculty to reconsider some of their own assumptions about teaching as they train U.S.-based MBA students."
Cultural Values and Communication Online,"Clyde A. Warden, Judy F. Chen, D’Arcy Caskey","Whereas many researchers have examined differences in values and behavior between Westerners and Asians, fewer have investigated differences within Asian cultural groups. A recent government initiative in Taiwan to encourage international education has led to the development of an international MBA program at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan; both Chinese and Southeast Asian students participate in the program. They exhibit different behaviors in their classes, particularly in their postings in online discussion boards. For reasons that can be partly explained by the students’ responses on a Chinese-Value Survey, Chinese students tend to post fewer messages than Southeast Asians, and both groups post fewer messages than Westerners in the classes under study. Instructors in multicultural classes have to consider such differences when they design assignments and set expectations for students in online discussions."
The MBA in Singapore,"Priscilla S. Rogers, Irene F.H. Wong","This study assesses communication training provided in MBA and executive MBA programs in Singapore. The authors found that Singapore is a microcosm in terms of (a) requirements for English competency, (b) the variety of communication offerings, and (c) the lack of uniformity in the delivery of communication training. Whereas Singaporean MBA/EMBA programs sit in a highly internationalized environment with substantial foreign student intake, and whereas Singapore is known for adopting best practices in education from around the world, communication training for management evidences a veneer of Asian content and imitation rather than innovation. These findings caused the authors to rethink what they have traditionally regarded as management communication and to consider the need for further internationalization, not only in this multicultural city-state but worldwide."
Communication Instruction in a Mature Institutional Partnership,"Martha Wetterhall Thomas, Samuel B. Hardy, IV","Since 1994, the University of South Carolina at Columbia and the Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration) have offered a joint master’s degree in international business. Communication instruction was initially a stable component of the program, with a week-long course at the beginning and a report-writing workshop at the end, followed by individual instruction in preparing deliverables for a consulting field project. Since the field projects were phased out in 2003, students continue to receive the one-week communication course in Vienna; after that, they have voluntary access to individual instruction from the Center for Business Communication at the University of South Carolina and exposure to in-class communication workshops as scheduled by faculty across the business disciplines. Although student feedback is positive, these instructional methods currently lack consistency. To achieve such consistency, a communication center can help to integrate instruct..."
Management Communication in Non-U.S. MBA Programs,Melinda Knight,"A study of top-ranked, full-time, global MBA programs suggests that management communication is indeed both an important focus and component in the curriculum. The methods of delivery, however, do not seem to follow any particular model, such as the common U.S. practice of a separate program or department. Required courses are found at 10 of the 24 schools, including two at 2 schools. Elective communication courses are offered at 8 schools, and related courses, those with a communication component, appear at all but 1 school. Communication is perceived as being an integral part of overall management development and global leadership, as opposed to a skill that could be assessed via testing or other assessment."
Visual Rhetoric in the Curriculum,Eva R. Brumberger,"A survey of BizCom listserv subscribers suggests that visual rhetoric receives relatively little attention within business communication curricula. Results indicate that programs typically do not require a course in visual rhetoric, and on average, 20% or less of teaching in undergraduate courses is dedicated to visual communication. The findings suggest that business communication curricula may not adequately prepare students for the multimodal communication tasks they are likely to encounter in the workplace, particularly those tasks that rely on knowledge of visual rhetoric. Possible solutions include adding courses, integrating visual communication more deeply into existing courses, contextualizing existing design projects to ensure they are more than software exercises, and incorporating visual communication into other typical course projects."
Preparing Students for Early Work Conflicts,"Laura L. Myers, R. Sam Larson","To improve college students’ skills in resolving workplace conflict, the authors studied the types of workplace conflicts that students encounter with peers or supervisors in part-time or seasonal work and with whom they discuss these conflicts. The authors found that most students report conflicts that are process or relational in nature, with few students reporting task-oriented conflict. Nearly all students report discussing the conflict with third parties—individuals outside the organization and/or the conflict—and nearly all students find these discussions helpful in resolving or working through the conflict. Based on their literature review and research, the authors developed scenarios to help students “read” and resolve workplace conflicts. The scenarios use conversations with people outside the conflict—third-party discussions—to help students respond appropriately to the conflict."
The Business Profession,Thomas Clark,"Designed to guide those who want to replicate a similar program at their institutions, this article examines Xavier University’s experience with The Business Profession, a required, noncredit series of career-related events that business majors take over a 4-year period. This program was developed in response to research indicating that early career decision making and excellent career communication skills lead to better student employment choices. The Business Profession differs from traditional university career education programs in several ways. It is (a) developmental: It offers learner-centered programming over a 4-year period covering topics that match students’ growing career maturity; (b) cocurricular: It is offered as a cocurricular supplement to the academic business program; (c) mandatory: Business majors are required to complete this program as a graduation prerequisite; and (d) faculty directed: A tenured business communication faculty serves as director. Evaluations indicate students find t..."
Diagnostic and Value-Added Assessment of Business Writing,"Linda Fraser, Katrin Harich, Joni Norby, Kathy Brzovic, Teeanna Rizkallah, Dana Loewy","To assess students’ business writing abilities upon entry into the business program and exit from the capstone course, a multitiered assessment package was developed that measures students’ achievement of specific learning outcomes and provides “value-added” scores. The online segment of the test measures five competencies across three process levels; the in-class writing segment measures the same five competencies across higher process levels. The data can then be cross-referenced for multitiered measurements. The learning outcomes are derived from the grading rubric used in the business communication classes, thus bringing classroom grading practices into assessment at the program level. The core competencies, rubric, writing prompt, and sample questions are provided. The process of designing the assessment, engaging faculty participation, and measuring outcomes are detailed."
Writing the Learning Organization,Stevens R. Amidon,"The marginalization of business writing as a discipline has been traced to a lack of research and to the that many in the field teach in business departments that do not value the work of scholars in English studies. One way out of this position may be an act of disciplinary border crossing—aligning the field of business writing with progressive voices in business and management. This article describes a framework structured around key theoretical concepts from Senge’s The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization (1995). Senge’s text is surprisingly rhetorical, and I examine the associated framework in terms of its potential for invigorating both teaching and research in business writing, thereby building ethos for the profession."
Workplace Communication,"Katherine N. Kinnick, Sabrena R. Parton","This article reports the results of a content analysis of the debut season of the reality television show, The Apprentice. All 15 episodes were examined to determine the role that communication competencies played in competitors’ success or elimination. Results indicate that the ability to persuade effectively was most critical to winning tasks, but leadership skills and interpersonal skills were the most common sources of praise and criticism from teammates and Donald Trump and his associates. Women appeared to be judged more critically for their interpersonal skills than men, whereas evaluations of men focused primarily on their leadership abilities."
Building a Shared Virtual Learning Culture,"Doreen Starke-Meyerring, Deborah Andrews","Business professionals increasingly use digital tools to collaborate across multiple cultures, locations, and time zones. Success in this complex environment depends on a shared culture that facilitates the making of knowledge and the best contributions of all team members. To prepare managers for such communication, the authors designed and implemented a semester-long intercultural virtual team project between a management communication course in the United States and one in Canada. To prevent faultlines between subgroups on each campus, the authors set a clear outcome for students’ research, established equity between the two sites, structured assignments so that students worked interdependently across sites”, and encouraged inclusive communication. Faculty considering such a partnership should incorporate a robust collaborative workspace, incorporate preliminary exercises before a large project, provide intensive mentoring and instruction on peer review, arrange for a real visit or videoconference betw..."
Impact of Error Labeling on Error Elimination in Business Writing,Zane K. Quible,"This article reports a quasi-experimental study of how error labeling in remediation exercises affects students’ writing performance. Students in five sections of a course in written business communication composed the control group, whereas students in two sections composed the treatment group. On the first letter each group wrote early in the semester—before the treatment group began error labeling in remediation exercises—no significant differences were found in the writing performance of both groups. However, on their last letter written late in the semester, studentsin the treatment group significantly reduced the number of sentence-level errors they made, compared to students in the control group. The improved writing performance of the treatment group is attributed to error labeling in conjunction with error correction in the remediation exercises."
Résumé Writing in Russia and the Newly Independent States,"Betsy Bowen, David Alan Sapp, Nelly Sargsyan","This article examines the teaching of résumé writing at one university in Russia and several institutions in the Newly Independent States (NIS). The authors explore challenges including variable cultural norms for written versus oral communication, severe financial and material hardship in the educational sector, cultural discomfort with the norms of U.S. business writing, issues related to the transition from Soviet-style socialism to Western-style capitalism, and other historical factors that shape expectations for business communication in Russia and the NIS. Recommendations to business writing and communication faculty conclude the article."
Ethics in Conflict,"Michael C. Barnes, Michael Keleher","The past two decades have seen an increased emphasis placed on the relationship between communication and ethics, a subject that philosophers have debated for centuries. An analysis of textbooks as disciplinary artifacts reveals that students enrolled in communication courses across the university are often presented with conflicting or contradictory ethics instruction. Commonly, business and technical communication textbooks advocate a foundational approach toward the subject, whereas interpersonal communication textbooks, as taught within the liberal arts, support a nonfoundational view. Rather than bolstering students’ understanding of the importance of ethical communication, such broad-based contradictions might lead to an overall ambivalence toward the subject. A critical pedagogy—one that acknowledges and explores this tacit disciplinary debate on ethics—would provide students a more comprehensive philosophical and historical basis for determining their own perspectives on ethical communication."
Can We Succeed in Teaching Business Students to Write Effectively?,"Khushwant K. S. Pittenger, Mary C. Miller, Jesse Allison","This article presents the results of a study where business students’ writing skills were assessed using an external objective measure in a business communication course. The student performance was disappointing before instructor intervention. After the intervention, student performance improved noticeably. The implications of the study are discussed for those who teach writing skills."
Powerful or Pointless? Faculty Versus Student Perceptions of PowerPoint Use in Business Education,"Karen E. James, Lisa A. Burke, Holly M. Hutchins","The use of PowerPoint (PPT)–based lectures in business classes across universities is ubiquitous yet understudied in empirical pedagogical research. The purpose of this empirical study was to ascertain whether significant differences exist between faculty and student perceptions with regard to PPT's impact on perceived learning, classroom interactions, and student behaviors. The results indicated that (a) students have a significantly less favorable overall view of PPT's influence on cognitive learning and classroom interaction than faculty members; (b) unlike faculty members, students do not believe that posting notes on the Web will decrease their motivation to attend class; and (c) both faculty members and students perceive that PPT has a favorable impact on notetaking quality, content recall during exams, emphasis on key lecture points, and holding student attention during class. The authors offer implications for instructors and future research."
Literacy in Decline: Untangling the Evidence,Daphne A. Jameson,"National assessments of U.S. high school students' writing and other verbal abilities do not show that literacy has declined substantially in recent years. In fact, scores have been relatively stable since the 1980s. The proportion of students with solid writing and reading abilities has held fairly steady but remained small during the past 25 years. During this period, however, the proportion of high school graduates who enter higher education has soared. Thus, more students with weak verbal abilities now enter college. Initiatives that encourage people to continue their education have succeeded, whereas initiatives to improve writing, reading, and reasoning abilities have not. The complex causes of entering college students' weak verbal abilities include social and cultural forces as well as decisions by educational institutions. By understanding the complicated history of this issue and reframing it in positive terms, business and technical communication faculty can help effect change."
Team Learning and Communication: the Effectiveness of Email-Based Ethics Discussions,"Lucia Peek, George Peek, Maria Roxas, Yves Robichaud, Huguette Blanco","In fall 2003, students from two U.S. universities and a Canadian university participated in an ethics project. One solution to overcome the obstacles to ethics discussions among students who are geographically separated is the use of email as a mode of communication. As a basis for their discussions, the students used the accounting ethics vignette titled “The Error” from the Ar thur Andersen Business Ethics Program. This ar ticle repor ts on the results of the analysis of U.S. and Canadian students' responses to pre- and postquestionnaires concerning the alternatives available to the character in the ethics scenario before and after their written email discussions and group repor ts. The students did have significant changes in their responses after their discussions of the character's alternatives. It also repor ts the students' responses to a project feedback questionnaire concerning the students' perceptions of the importance of ethical training and discussions."
Their Perspectives: ESL Students' Reflections On Collaborative Community Service Learning,"Joanne M. Crossman, Stacey L. Kite","Our business communication classes will continue to be enriched by students from various cultural backgrounds, many of them ESL learners. Among the numerous benefits of this diversity are oppor tunities for all students to develop essential life skills through course-embedded community ser vice learning (CSL) projects. This study analyzes students' guided reflections in response to qualitative probes regarding CSL projects required for all MBA candidates at the study site. Data were gathered during a 5-year period from 326 reflective repor ts. More than 80% of the reflective question responses were authored by international students; approximately 60% of those were ESL learners. The findings reveal differences not only between ESL learners and native speakers of English but also between ESL students. Key themes discussed include cultural sensitivity, teamwork, contributive roles, conflict resolution skills, and pragmatic communication skills. The findings presented are accompanied by students' comments, c..."
An Exploratory Study of Listening Practice Relative to Memory Testing and Lecture in Business Administration Courses,Robin T. Peterson,This study investigates the combined impact of a memory test and subsequent listening practice in enhancing student listening abilities in collegiate business administration courses. The article reviews relevant literature and describes an exploratory study that was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of this technique with traditional lecture. The inquiry provided evidence of the potential value of memory tests and listening practice as pedagogical tools that promote listening ability.
Lessons Learned From Instructional Design Theory: an Application in Management Education,Lisa A. Burke,"Given that many doctoral programs do not provide extensive training on how to present course information in the classroom, the current paper looks to educational psychology theory and research for guidance. Richard Mayer and others' copious empirical work on effective and ineffective instructional design, along with relevant research findings in cognitive science, are summarized and adapted to the management education context. The goal of this article is to enhance instructors' ability to effectively relay course material and to offer specific advice for how instructors can implement prior research findings."
Using a Client Memo to Assess Critical Thinking of Finance Majors,"David Carrithers, John C. Bean","This article describes a holistic, discourse-based method for assessing the critical thinking skills of undergraduate senior-level finance majors. Rejecting a psychometric assessment approach in which component features of critical thinking are disaggregated, this study is based on a holistic scoring of student memos. Students were asked to recommend and justify a course of action to a lay client facing an ill-structured finance problem. Analysis of student memos reveals critical thinking weaknesses that may be ameliorated by changes in assignments or instructional methods. The memos reveal four kinds of critical thinking problems: (a) failure to address the client's problem, (b) random rather than purposeful application of finance tools and methodologies, (c) inability to translate finance concepts or methods into lay language, and (d) inability to construct rhetorically useful graphics. The curricular implications of this study are discussed."
Communicating Across the Curriculum in an Undergraduate Business Program: Management 100—Leadership and Communication in Groups,"Elizabeth A. Tuleja, Anne M. Greenhalgh","Educating undergraduate business students in the 21st century requires more than addressing the quantitative side of business; rather, it calls for including the more qualitative “soft skills,” such as speaking and writing. This article examines the design, delivery, and effectiveness of an undergraduate program dedicated to leadership, teamwork, and communication and describes this program within the context of the communication across the curriculum movement."
Expressive Practices: The Local Enactment of Culture in the Communication Classroom,"Karen Wolf, Trudy Milburn, Richard Wilkins","As students participate in corporate communication classes, they may, on occasion, use the term culture to make sense of their experiences. The authors use Mino's idea of a learning paradigm to shift the emphasis away from teaching traditional theories of culture and use student-centered experiences to teach culture as an expressive practice. Using instances drawn from their own classrooms, the authors show how students can recognize the value of understanding their role in creating culture each time they choose how to act, how to evaluate others' behavior, and whether to label what is going on as cultural."
Integrating Writing Skills and Ethics Training in Business Communication Pedagogy: A Résumé Case Study Exemplar,Cynthia E. Conn,An integrated approach to teaching résumé construction in the business communication classroom focuses on simultaneously (a) emphasizing writing-related proficiencies and (b) encouraging ethical and moral orientations to this task. This article provides a résumé construction exemplar that operationalizes these two pedagogical goals. The techniques and exercises used in the exemplar are presented as a way to make ethics education accessible for both business communication instructors and students.
PowerPoint-Based Lectures in Business Education: An Empirical Investigation of Student-Perceived Novelty and Effectiveness,"Lisa A. Burke, Karen E. James","The use of PowerPoint (PPT)-based lectures in business classes is prevalent, yet it remains empirically understudied in business education research. The authors investigate whether students in the contemporary business classroom view PPT as a novel stimulus and whether these perceptions of novelty are related to students' self-assessment of learning. Results indicate that the degree of novelty that undergraduate business students associate with PPT-based teaching significantly relates to their perceptions of PPT's impact on cognitive learning and classroom interaction. Students' views of PPT as a novel stimulus are also associated with their perception of specific constructive and dysfunctional classroom behaviors and attitudes. The authors discuss their findings and offer implications for instructors and researchers in business education."
Messy Problems and Lay Audiences: Teaching Critical Thinking Within the Finance Curriculum,"David Carrithers, Teresa Ling, John C. Bean","This article investigates the critical thinking difficulties of finance majors when asked to address ill-structured finance problems. The authors build on previous research in which they asked students to analyze an ill-structured investment problem and recommend a course of action. The results revealed numerous critical thinking weaknesses, including a failure to address the client's problem, use analytical tools systematically, construct rhetorically useful graphics, or translate finance concepts and methodologies into lay language. The present research aims to understand more deeply why students struggle with ill-structured problems. Using think-aloud protocols, audiotaped interviews, and other strategies, the authors explore causes of finance students' difficulties and suggest strategies for addressing them. The results suggest that the homework tasks typically given them, such as quantitative problem sets using algorithmic procedures, do not prepare them to confront ill-structured problems requiring ..."
The Effect of Rater Training on Reducing Social Style Bias in Peer Evaluation,Gary L. May,"This study employed a quasiexperimental control group design in a university setting to test the effect of a rater-training program on reducing social style bias in intragroup peer evaluations after controlling for ability based on GPA. Comparison of rating scores of the test group to the control group indicated minimal social style rating bias in the test group, whereas significant bias was exhibited in the control group. Implications for college instructors who use peer evaluations for grading in team projects are discussed."
Students Advise Fortune 500 Company: Designing a Problem-Based Learning Community,"Kathy Brzovic, S. Irene Matz","This article describes the process of planning and implementing a problem-based learning community. Business and communication students from a large university in the Western United States competed in teams to solve an authentic business problem posed by a Fortune 500 company. The company's willingness to adopt some of their recommendations testified to the professional quality of their final product. This experience gave students an opportunity to apply communication concepts to a business problem. They learned how to make vital connections between theory and practice and between shared knowledge and shared knowing. In the process, students grew personally and professionally."
Aspects of Intercultural Awareness Through an MBA Study Abroad Program: Going “Backstage”,Elizabeth A. Tuleja,"Understanding the globalization of business practices is an important area of learning for students studying in master of business administration (MBA) programs today, and many graduate business programs offer study tour programs for experiential learning. This article examines the instructional design of one program and makes recommendations for how to place greater emphasis on intercultural learning in conjunction with business learning. A description of student learning through presurveys and postsurveys, as well as reflections through term papers, is explored."
Merck's Open Letters and the Teaching of Ethos,Frank Griffin,"In fall 2004, Merck faced a significant threat to the company's public image because of the withdrawal of VIOXX, and Merck executives were forced to defend the company's actions, its motivation for those actions, and its reputation. Confronted with enormous rhetorical challenges, Merck tried to generate public goodwill toward the company by creating a personalized image of a corporate giant worthy of understanding, sympathy, and trust. Open letters released during the initial response to the VIOXX crisis rely on the intimacy of interpersonal communication and demonstrate to students of business communication arguments based on ethos. The syntax and diction of these documents are analyzed to demonstrate how they create a secondary narrative of Merck's good sense, good moral character, and goodwill. Finally, the study presents apparently contradictory narratives of this pharmaceutical giant's responsibility, narratives that summarize the arguments in the VIOXX litigation. Analysis of Merck's open letters un..."
Using Critical Praxis to Understand and Teach Teamwork,"David R. Seibold, Paul Kang","The authors pursue three aims in this article. The first is to underscore critical praxis as an especially valuable approach to understanding and enabling teamwork. The second is to offer four dimensions of teamwork—vision, roles, processes, and relationships— as salient areas to interrogate using critical praxis. The third aim is to consider the implications and methods for teaching teamwork in the classroom context. In the process of doing so, the authors highlight limitations of prevailing theoretical approaches and note changes in their own practice of teaching and facilitating teamwork that have occurred through a commitment to critical praxis."
Facilitating Better Teamwork: Analyzing the Challenges and Strategies of Classroom-Based Collaboration,Terri A. Fredrick,"To help students develop teamwork skills, teachers should be aware of the strategies students already employ to assert authority and manage conflict. Researchers studying engineering students have identified two such approaches: transfer-of-knowledge sequences, in which students emulate teacher and pupil roles; and collaborative sequences, in which students use circular talk to reach consensus. As demonstrated in this article, these strategies are also used by students in professional communication courses. The second half of this article provides specific suggestions for designing team assignments, interacting effectively with student teams, and developing evaluations that value the process of teamwork."
"Project Management, Critical Praxis, and Process-Oriented Approach to Teamwork"," Huiling Ding,  Xin Ding","To help alleviate issues of free-riding and conflicts in team projects, this study proposes the systematic incorporation of project management methods to introduce a process-oriented approach to and a critical praxis in team projects. We examined how the systematic use of project management methods influenced students' performance in team projects. The findings demonstrate that such an approach enables the documentation and evaluation of and reflection on both individual and team work. Our findings indicate that project management tools enhance team member accountability and help reduce free-riding."
Teamwork Through Team Building: Face-to-Face to Online,"Julie Staggers, Susan Garcia, Ed Nagelhout","This article describes the ways the authors incorporated team-building activities into our online business writing courses by interrogating the ways that kinesthetic learning translates into the electronic realm. The authors review foundational theories of team building, including Cog's Ladder and Tuckman's Stages, and offer sample exercises they have converted. The authors show how the medium affects the exercises, how the choices made as teachers affect the exercises, and how they adjusted to meet the needs of their students. The authors argue that teamwork most successfully occurs after team building, and too often this team building is lacking in online environments."
"Team Attributes, Processes, and Values: a Pedagogical Framework","Joann Keyton, Stephenson J. Beck","This article proposes a pedagogical framework to help students analyze their group and team interactions. Intersecting five fundamental group attributes (group size, group goal, group member interdependence, group structure, and group identity) with three overarching group processes (leadership, decision making, and conflict management) creates an analytical tool for the examination of team interaction. Furthermore, each group attribute/group process intersection encourages analytical questions targeting assumptions, values, and ethical positions embedded within the group. One advantage of this heuristic device is that it weds team member behaviors with the values members espouse and enact during team interactions. Pedagogical considerations are also discussed."
Teaching Professional Writing To American Students in a Study Abroad Program,"Deborah C. Andrews, Brent Henze","Studying abroad enhances the intercultural competencies of American students, but that enhancement strategy may be seen as an obstacle to those in business and technical fields who follow a tight curriculum and work to cover expenses. To meet their needs, U.S. professional communication faculty are designing short courses that can be delivered abroad during between-term periods and that foster an understanding of the situations and genres of the field within a context of cultural dislocation. Based on the courses described in this article, the best approach is to settle students in one location rather than touring; keep student numbers low by an entrepreneurial approach to keeping costs low; encourage students to live as the locals do, in apartments rather than hotels; explicitly plan appropriate access to technology; use class time to provide structure and reflection, but allow free time for collateral learning; and make sure the course grows local roots."
Writing for the Robot: How Employer Search Tools Have Influenced Résumé Rhetoric and Ethics,"Nicole Amare, Alan Manning","To date, business communication scholars and textbook writers have encouraged résumé rhetoric that accommodates technology, for example, recommending keyword-enhancing techniques to attract the attention of searchbots: customized search engines that allow companies to automatically scan résumés for relevant keywords. However, few scholars have discussed the ethical implications of adjusting résumé keywords for the sole purpose of increasing searchbot hits. As the résumé genre has evolved over the past century, strategies of résumé “padding” have likewise evolved, at each stage violating one of four maxims of the Cooperative Principle. Direct factual misrepresentation violates the maxim of quality and is of course discouraged, but résumé writers have turned in succession to violations of manner (formatting tricks) and then more recently to violations of quantity and/or relevance with deceptive keywording techniques. The authors conclude by suggesting several techniques to business communication instructors..."
Do Business Communication Technology Tools Meet Learner Needs?,"Debbie D. DuFrene, Carol M. Lehman, Franz W. Kellermanns, Rodney A. Pearson","While institutions of higher education are enthusiastically embracing technology-mediated learning (TML), little research has been conducted to identify factors that influence student use of TML tools or determine whether use of them increases student learning. This study of business communication students at two universities found that (1) students tend to be sensing, visual, active, and sequential learners; (2) perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of TML tools are positively associated with perceived learning success; (3) learning styles do influence the students' usage behavior of certain TML tools; and (4) students' sensing/intuitive learning style is related to their perceived learning success."
Employer Preferences for Résumés and Cover Letters,"Nancy M. Schullery, Linda Ickes, Stephen E. Schullery","This article reports the results of a survey of employers' preferences for résumé style, résumé delivery method, and cover letters. Employers still widely prefer the standard chronological résumé, with only 3% desiring a scannable résumé. The vast majority of employers prefer electronic delivery, either by email (46%) or at the company's Web site (38%), with only 7% preferring a paper copy. Cover letters are preferred by a majority (56%). Preferences regarding résumé style and cover letters were independent of national (USA) vs. multinational geographic range, company size, type of industry, or respondent's job function. Smaller companies prefer résumé delivery by email, and human resources workers prefer delivery using the company's Web site."
Structuring a Competency-Based Accounting Communication Course At the Graduate Level,"Mohsen Sharifi, Gary B. McCombs, Linda Lussy Fraser, Robert K. McCabe","The authors describe a graduate capstone accounting class as a basis for building communication skills desired by both accounting practitioners and accounting faculty. An academic service-learning (ASL) component is included. Adopted as a required class for a master of science degree in accounting at two universities, this course supports accounting accreditation. Surveys offer evidence that both accounting practitioners and faculty rate, in slightly different order, the three most important skills as written communication, oral communication, and analytical/critical thinking. Accounting curricula worldwide are under pressure to develop better skills in these areas as well as to meet assessment and accreditation directives and criteria. The authors designed a communication course utilizing ASL that not only meets all of the above objectives but also provides the student with hands-on experiential learning. Information about this course provides a guide to accounting and business faculty who may wish to pu..."
Trends in Industry Supervisors’ Feedback On Business Communication Internships,"David Alan Sapp, Qin Zhang","The purpose of this empirical study is to explore expectations of industry insiders and identify how student interns are performing in relation to those expectations as defined by 11 performance areas. The results of a survey of 238 industry supervisors were collected over a 5-year period in the departments of English and communication at a private university in the Northeast. While the results suggest that student interns tend to meet their supervisors’ expectations in many areas, performance categories such as initiative, writing skills, and oral communication skills require increased attention in the ways we prepare students for their internships and post-graduation employment and, perhaps, the ways we help onsite supervisors develop expectations for and evaluate our interns."
The Graphic Novel: a “Cool” Format for Communicating to Generation Y,"Jeremy C. Short, Terrie C. Reeves",The graphic novel provides an attractive medium to communicate business concepts with a number of characteristics that may aid student learning in a more effective manner than traditional textbooks. The authors provide an overview of the graphic novel format and use McLuhan’s research on “hot” versus “cool” media as a theoretical base that highlights how and why this format can be a useful tool to present management content relevant for the current generation of business students. The authors provide examples of how the graphic novel medium could be applied to business concepts and conclude with an agenda for future empirical research.
Practitioners’ Views About the Use of Business Email Within Organizational Settings: Implications for Developing Student Generic Competence,"Yunxia Zhu, Catherine White","Although extensive research has been done on teaching emails and on the use of emails in organisations, little research exists about how to incorporate organizational practitioners’ views as the voices of the community of social practice. To remedy this pedagogical gap, this article uses a genre approach to discuss organizational practitioners’ views on the use of email in organizational settings. It also develops seven teaching and learning stages for situated learning and teaching in business communication based upon the presented study findings."
“It Actually Made Me Think”: Problem-Based Learning in the Business Communications Classroom,"Michael Pennell, Libby Miles","We advocate for problem-based learning (PBL) as a rhetorical pedagogy for business communication. Briefly put, classic PBL inverts the typical instructional sequence; rather than presenting concepts first and then asking students to apply them, PBL creates situations in which students must learn the concepts in order to solve a “problem” constructed for that purpose. Thus, students learn in an iterative process as they cycle through the three key questions: “What do we know?” “What do we need to know?” and “How will we learn it?” We advocate emphasizing three key elements inherent in classic PBL: rhetoricity, locality, and change."
The Status of the Business Communication Course at U.S. Colleges and Universities,Travis L. Russ,"This study examines the current status of the introductory business communication course at colleges and universities across the United States. Using data collected during the spring of 2008 from a national sample of 505 instructors, this study reveals a number of pedagogical and programmatic insights about (1) major course sponsors; (2) academic levels at which the course is taught; (3) instructors’ ideal and actual class sizes; (4) use of distance learning; (5) content coverage; and (6) required learning assignments. Findings from this study are compared with results from previous audits. Future research ideas as well as implications for business communication education are presented."
Specific Oral Communication Skills Desired in New Accountancy Graduates,F. Elizabeth Gray,"International research findings and anecdotal evidence alike suggest that new accountancy graduates often begin their careers with inadequate oral communication skills. However, there is a lack of well-grounded empirical data concerning precisely what accountancy employers mean by “oral communication” and what specific skills they value most highly. This article describes a research project investigating the importance of 27 oral communication skills for students intending to begin an accountancy career in New Zealand, as perceived by chartered accountancy professionals. It also examines how frequently accountancy employers are finding these desired skills in new graduates. The findings reported in this study offer important guidance concerning the oral communication skills that new graduates will find most useful in the New Zealand accountancy workplace and suggest useful directions for accountancy students internationally."
Bring Workplace Assessment Into Business Communication Classrooms: a Proposal to Better Prepare Students for Professional Workplaces, Han Yu,"To help students better understand and be better prepared for professional workplaces, the author suggests that business communication teachers examine and learn from workplace assessment methods. Throughout the article, the author discusses the rationale behind this proposal, reviews relevant literature, reports interview findings on workplace assessment, and compares classroom and workplace practices to suggest areas where we can meaningfully bridge the two."
Does Business Writing Require Information Literacy?,"Irvin R. Katz, Catherine Haras, Carol Blaszczynski","Although the business community increasingly recognizes information literacy as central to its work, there remains the critical problem of measurement: How should employers assess the information literacy of their current or potential workers? In this article, we use a commercially available assessment to investigate the relationship between information literacy and the key business communication skill of business writing. Information literacy scores obtained prior to instruction predicted performance in an undergraduate, upper-division business writing course. Similar results emerged regardless of whether participants considered English their best language."
Looking Across the Divide: Analyzing Cross-Disciplinary Approaches for Teaching Business Communication,"Nicole M. Laster, Travis L. Russ","This study elucidates pedagogical differences and similarities between the ways in which instructors from business and communication disciplines teach the introductory business communication course. During the spring of 2008, the authors surveyed 444 instructors teaching this course at colleges and universities across the United States. Their findings highlight several cross-disciplinary commonalities and disparities. The article discusses potential implications for the complementary and contradictory instructional approaches and call for more cross-disciplinary uniformity in contemporary business communication education."
Instructional Interventions for Improving Proofreading and Editing Skills of College Students,Marcella F. Enos,This article summarizes a dissertation study designed to determine the effectiveness of instructional interventions that focus on proofreading and editing skills of first-year college students enrolled in business communication courses. The study used a pretest-posttest quasiexperimental control group design and collected data from 56 participants based on the results of the Grammar and Mechanics Diagnostic Assessment for two experimental groups and a control group. The results of the project were compiled and analyzed using descriptive statistics and a repeated measures analysis of variance.
Students’ Perceived Preference for Visual and Auditory Assessment With E-Handwritten Feedback,"Tena B. Crews, Kelly Wilkinson","Undergraduate business communication students were surveyed to determine their perceived most effective method of assessment on writing assignments. The results indicated students’ preference for a process that incorporates visual, auditory, and e-handwritten presentation via a tablet PC. Students also identified this assessment process would improve their writing by helping them understand the types of errors they were making and why these errors were incorrect. Students also indicated this type of assessment would help build a relationship with the instructor and help them be successful in the class."
Outsourced: Using a Comedy Film to Teach Intercultural Communication,Carol Briam,"Given that feature films can enhance the teaching of intercultural communication, this article describes in detail how the 2006 comedy film, Outsourced, can be integrated into a course. The article relates the film to four different functions of film and shows how Outsourced can help create an intercultural experience for students, serve as the basis for a case analysis of cross-cultural adjustment, give meaning to cultural concepts, and create powerful metaphorical images to expand classroom discussions to broader issues. Also explored are ways the film can be used in teaching advanced intercultural communication concepts."
Unsettling Assumptions and Boundaries: Strategies for Developing a Critical Perspective About Business and Management Communication,"Cheryl Cockburn-Wootten, Tom Cockburn","This article describes how a collaborative class strategy and an introductory activity were used to develop students’ thinking about business and management communication. The article focuses on teachers who want to integrate critical perspectives about business communication into their classes. A course ethos, learning groups, and an introductory activity were used to develop students’ thinking about business and management communication. These strategies encouraged collaborative peer learning in a large bicultural/multicultural lecture environment and developed learning relationships typically found in a small class context. In addition, the activities produced ongoing lecture learning groups in which business students could question their “trained incapacities,” boundaries, and assumptions gained from their experiences of communicating and managing relationships during these activities."
Optimizing Millennials’ Communication Styles,"Jackie L. Hartman, Jim McCambridge","Millennials, those individuals born between 1980 and 2000, compose the largest cohort of college students in the United States. Stereotypical views of millennials characterize them as technologically sophisticated multitaskers, capable of significant contributions to tomorrow’s organizations, yet deficient in communication skills. This article offers insights for business educators to help millennials understand the influence of communication styles when optimizing communication effectiveness. Developing style-typing and style-flexing skills can serve as building blocks for millennials’ subsequent interpersonal skill development in key areas such as audience analysis, active listening, conflict management and negotiation, and effective team building. An in-class exercise highlighting communication style-typing and style-flexing is included."
Teaching Job Interviewing Skills With the Help of Television Shows,Janel Bloch,"Because of its potential for humor and drama, job interviewing is frequently portrayed on television. This article discusses how scenes from popular television series such as Everybody Loves Raymond, Friends, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show can be used to teach effective job interview skills in business communication courses. Television episodes may be used to examine in detail topics commonly covered in textbook discussions of job interviewing, such as attire, behavior, and interview questions; they may also be used to explore topics not typically addressed, such as gender issues and involvement of family members. The use of appropriate television scenes can enhance the job interviewing unit by attracting the students’ attention and generating productive class discussion. The article also provides an overview of the relevant U.S. legality issues."
Tackling the Sustainability Dilemma: A Holistic Approach to Preparing Students for the Professional Organization,Sibylle Mabry,"Increased knowledge of business sustainability as the basis of a holistic approach to value creation has inspired many managers to integrate ecological and social stewardship into their strategic business innovation plans. However, the coverage of sustainability issues in business courses remains small at many universities. This article illustrates how business communication students can become cognitively, behaviorally, and emotionally involved in the analysis and evaluation of the complex sustainability paradigm via an assignment focusing on sustainability. The approach integrates several levels of learning, stretching students’ cognitive skills and enhancing the emotional competencies and behavioral skills needed to enter high-level business jobs."
GMAT-AWA Score as a Predictor of Success in a Managerial Communication Course,"Kathy L. Hill, Geraldine E. Hynes, Marguerite P. Joyce, John S. Green","Because communication skills, especially writing, are such an integral part of managerial work, it may be postulated that these skills are associated with managerial success. Yet evidence of writing competency is not universally considered for admission to MBA programs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between the Analytical Writing Assessment Section (AWA) of the GMAT exam and a “critical thinking” writing assignment that is similar to the AWA. Results indicate that the AWA is significantly correlated with achievement, not only on the writing assignment but also with the final grade in a managerial communication course."
Written and Computer-Mediated Accounting Communication Skills,Christopher G. Jones,"Communication skills are a fundamental personal competency for a successful career in accounting. What is not so obvious is the specific written communication skill set employers look for and the extent those skills are computer mediated. Using survey research, this article explores the particular skills employers desire and their satisfaction level with new hires. Results indicate that basic writing mechanics are the skills in highest demand, followed by effective documentation. Except for email proficiency, employers do not consider computer-mediated communication competencies as important as traditional business communication skills. The article concludes with curricular implications for accounting communication."
Improving Employee Selection With a Revised Resume Format,"Edward W. Wright, Theresa A. Domagalski, Ronald Collins",This study investigates the acceptance of a prototype resume that includes candidate personality assessment information. Data were obtained from hiring managers and human resource professionals in regional chapters of the Society for Human Resource Management. Respondents found the new content useful and that the new information added value when compared with a traditional resume. This study suggests the possibility of improving the effectiveness of candidate screening and selection with the inclusion of such data in a standard resume and may be useful for instructing new business school graduates in the preparation of their professional resumes.
Ethics and Ethos in Financial Reporting,Belinda Crawford Camiciottoli,"In response to ongoing concerns about financial ethics, this study analyzes the speech of company executives in quarterly earnings conference calls to understand strategic usage of ethics-related language. Against the backdrop of the recent global financial crisis, the Aristotelian concept of ethos provides a framework to investigate linguistic features that express ethical stance. Text analysis software was used to produce frequency profiles of features that were then further interpreted qualitatively. Results showed that the executives used a variety of more or less explicit terms to maintain a strong focus on trustworthiness and commitment to moving forward. The findings can inform the development of teaching materials that help learners become more effective communicators in the context of IT-mediated financial reporting."
The Rhetoric of Industrial Espionage,Daphne A. Jameson,"When Starwood Hotels charged Hilton Hotels with industrial espionage, the case hinged on an employment agreement that two executives had violated. The rhetoric of the employment agreement contrasted greatly with that of the corporation’s own code of business conduct. Whereas the private agreement stressed narrow self-interest, the public code emphasized a much broader network of ethical business relationships. This article analyzes the differences between these two types of business discourse in order to help business practitioners align espoused and enacted values."
My Favorite Assignment,D. Joel Whalen,"The seven Favorite Assignments featured in this article were originally presented at the 2010 ABC Annual Convention, Chicago, Illinois. The reader can consider a variety of learning objectives from team building to persuasion, application of electronic media to face-to-face communication, and much more. Some Favorite Assignments take a full semester to complete; others can be done within a single class. Each assignment reflects the individual author’s passion for active learning that stimulates practical skill-building, judgment, and communication skills."
The New Kind of Hospital Volunteer,Marcy Leasum Orwig,"While experts agree the U.S. recession is over, many employees feel that they are still being asked to do more work for less pay. This concept of less compensation for employees is not surprising, but no one has addressed how volunteers in organizations might also be affected by the economy. Are volunteers also expected to do more work for (literally) no monetary compensation? This case study explains how the duties asked of hospital volunteers are evolving and ends with a discussion of ethics relating to the volunteer descriptions used at a not-for-profit organization."
Eportfolios in Business Communication Courses as Tools for Employment,"Ephraim A. Okoro, Melvin C. Washington, Peter W. Cardon","Eportfolios are a powerful tool for business students to gain self-awareness and take control of their learning experiences. Ideally, they can be used as online profiles in the job application process, allowing more authenticity, personalization, and completeness than traditional résumés. In our colleges, eportfolios help students reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and form goals for professional development. Overall, however, our students’ eportfolios lack the professional touch of their résumés. We believe extensive coordination within a college is required to help business students create eportfolios that they can use to market themselves for professional positions."
Eportfolio,"Nikki Graves, Molly Epstein","At Emory University’s Goizueta Business School, eportfolio serves as the foundation for a sequence of assignments in our core “Communication and Professional Development” course. Our philosophy underlying the use of eportfolio is influenced by narrative and sense-making theory. At the beginning of the semester, students record their experiences and accomplishments on eportfolio. We then guide students to identify the narrative themes running through their experiences, and to use those themes to develop personal brand statements, stories that demonstrate their strengths and values in action, and professional development plans. This sequence of assignments allows students to imagine, construct, and articulate a professional identity through narrative."
Eportfolios,LeeAnne G. Kryder,"Use of eportfolios for business communication students in an advanced two-quarter capstone brought an unexpected networking opportunity, in addition to their conventional use as a showcase for student writing and research. This article discusses how students developed their eportfolios. Then, through use of a course website providing an optional link to those eportfolios, students were able to use portfolios to jumpstart conversations among other students and business communication alumni. The instructor has required both print and digital portfolios since 2006 and explains why both types of portfolios are useful, especially to enhance professional networking."
Eportfolios and Cognitive Storytelling,Charlotte Brammer,"Authentic reflections are critical components of strong portfolios, and students often struggle with this important task. Students in our program have found success through carefully constructed steps of collecting, selecting, and reflecting on artifacts from their coursework, internships, and extracurricular activities. Working in peer groups as well as meeting individually with the instructor are key parts of the entire process."
Integrating Social and Traditional Media in the Client Project,"James Melton, Nancy Hicks","Based on a client project assigned to students in two undergraduate business classes, this article argues that social media learning is best done in a context that mixes social media with more traditional kinds of media. Ideally, this approach will involve teams of students who are working on different aspects of a larger client project. This integrated setup has several benefits: It enhances the students’ understanding of social media within a real context, it complements more traditional communication methods, and it reveals the communicative aspects of key business functions."
Social Media,Orlando R. Kelm,"In assessing the application of social media on the teaching of business communication, this article looks at MBA student use of blogs, online photo database contributions, and video contributions to YouTube channels. These assignments were part of their course activities, which included a 2-week study tour in China. The article looks at these activities within the context of the social constructivist view on learning in general. The student work provides evidence of the positive results that come from the use of social media, when viewed from the perspective of social constructivist theories for learning."
The Social Networking Arena,"Timothy W. Clipson, S. Ann Wilson, Debbie D. DuFrene","Social networking via texting, Facebook, Twitter, and similar media is enormously popular with students, though it often leads to communication challenges along gender lines. Research supports the fact that men and women have divergent expectations for social networking and use it differently. Students can benefit from classroom experiences that raise their awareness of communication challenges associated with social networking and encourage them to assess their own areas for improvement."
AxeCorp’s Team Challenge,Kendra Carmichael,"To prepare business communication undergraduates for a changing work world and to engage today’s tech-savvy students, many instructors have embraced social media by incorporating its use in the classroom. This article describes AxeCorp, a fictional company headquartered on the immersive social networking platform, Second Life, and one particular exercise developed for the “company,” the AxeCorp Team Challenge. This challenge attempts to integrate students’ skill development with their knowledge of communication concepts through the creation of a virtual team."
Experiencing a Social Network in an Organizational Context,Robert W. McEachern,"As Facebook becomes increasingly more popular as a communication tool for businesses and organizations, it is important that our students learn to transfer personal Facebook skills to professional settings. This article focuses on the lessons learned by two students who used Facebook as part of a social media internship, as well as what the author learned about its use through research and teaching a course on social media and professional writing."
"Extra-Role Time, Burnout, and Commitment","Lori A. Brown, Michael E. Roloff","This study examines the relationships of extra-role time (ERT) behavior with burnout and occupational commitment among teachers through the lens of conservation of resources (COR) theory. Results reveal that teachers who invest in more ERT are also more likely to experience burnout and decreased commitment to teaching than those who invest less. However, results also indicate that the ethical practice of the employer fulfilling the psychological contract (keeping promises) entered into with the teacher offsets this negative spiral with implications for both teacher well-being and workplace outcomes."
Corporate Responsibility in Communication,"Hanna Lehtimäki, Johanna Kujala, Anna Heikkinen","The paper examines how the tensions of corporate responsibility are articulated and reconciled in a controversial situation of a foreign investment. We conducted a conventionalist analysis on the company press releases in a case where a Finnish forest industry company invested in a pulp mill in South America. The findings show that the use of language in press releases mobilizes certain stakeholders while reassuring others, and that the argumentation used creates value-neutral communication, making it possible to pursue strategic goals despite competing values. For teaching, we provide insights on how to communicate in a conflict situation."
Group Communication and Critical Thinking Competence Development Using a Reality-Based Project,Edward Paulson,"The presented merger and acquisition classroom exercise is based on a real yet incomplete transaction transpiring during the period of the class. The approach enables adult students to apply their previously acquired business experience to a strategic analysis project facilitating the development of group communication, critical thinking, and consensus-building competences. The exercise assumes that students have practical experience in business areas such as marketing or accounting before entering the classroom, which may make it less applicable to conventional-age students."
Communicating CSR and Business Identity in the Chemical Industry Through Mission Slogans,Hans Verboven,"This article analyzes the communication of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate image in the chemical industry through mission slogans. Morsing’s (2006) CSR communication framework is adapted for a comparative analysis of the strategies behind mission slogans. By grouping rhetorical strategies in a mission slogan into a mission slogan functionality grid, it was found that most chemical companies use the mission slogan to share their value proposition (CSR promise) and to present their often-stigmatized activities in a euphemistic way. This article offers the tools to use mission slogans as lenses through which to analyze corporate image strategies."
Practicing What We Teach,"Bryan Ruppert, David A. Green","The authors investigate the importance of instructor communication behaviors in a course on business communication, arguing that alignment between instructor behaviors and the precepts of the discipline has a pronounced effect on perceived instructor credibility in this field. Student evaluations were analyzed qualitatively for their comments on instructor communication behaviors and quantitatively for the ratings students gave their instructors. This suggests a relationship between the two. The authors outline two classroom exercises to help students develop best practice in business communication, while also enhancing instructors’ credibility by showing how they apply best practice in their own documents."
"Visual Form, Ethics, and a Typology of Purpose",Christina Rosenquist,"Stallworth Williams introduces concepts of visual rhetoric and ethics for a classroom exercise in the analysis and revision of a sales letter. This article revisits Stallworth Williams’s proposed teaching strategies, suggesting that not only do students need to be instructed in elements of visual design, but they must also be taught to link those elements to specific decorative, indicative, or informative purposes. This method teaches students to design documents that meet shared goals (designer and recipient) and to recognize where designs fail in purpose, so revisions can be made using deliberate choice, based on a systematic framework."
Exploring Business Request Genres,"Hai Nguyen, Jennifer Miller","This article presents selective findings from an ongoing study that investigates rhetorical differences in business letter writing between Vietnamese students taking an English for Specific Purposes course in Vietnam and business professionals. Rhetorical analyses are based on two corpora, namely, scenario (N = 20) and authentic business letters of request (N = 25). Two criteria, the notion of move (a meaningful unit in linguistic form contributing to the communicative purposes of a text) and linguistic properties, are used for rhetorical analysis, supplemented by analysis of data from interviews with student participants. Based on the findings and discussions, recommendations are offered for preparing students well for the business workplace through incorporating more authentic models and contexts into pedagogical strategies."
Incorporating Facebook and Twitter in a Service-Learning Project in a Business Communication Course,"Tena B. Crews, Wanda L. Stitt-Gohdes",Implementing real-world business writing situations and service learning into business communication courses are not new concepts. Business communication students work through a service-learning project with nonprofit organizations to create communication documents to improve the nonprofit’s communication with the public. Writing for social networking sites is also included in the project. Students are asked to create a Facebook slogan for the nonprofit as well as various other Facebook announcements. Students also write tweets to encourage people to donate and to promote various activities. These activities help students write more concisely and think critically about the key elements of writing and of the nonprofit’s mission.
Strategic Communication and Social Media,Michael J. Meredith,"Social media offers an exciting new area for our discipline to produce research and pedagogy that is in high demand by students, industry constituents, and other disciplines. This article discusses why business communication scholars should focus on social media as an important stream of study and outlines an MBA course in social media strategy currently in development from a business communication perspective. The author challenges the discipline to create social media content from an integrated communication approach."
EBooks,"Pedro David Martinez-Estrada, Roger N. Conaway","Many people have considered purchasing a tablet device, such as an iPad, Kindle, or Nook, for personal use, yet how many have considered adopting this new technology as a pedagogical tool in the classroom? This article reports on the adoption and use of Kindle eBooks on the campus during the Spring 2010 semester. The authors report on how the eBook supported student learning and course outcomes, and they examine the results of survey assessments of the eBook project. Overall, the university believes that the pilot project conducted proved to be a success, and the campus will continue using tablet devices in the future."
Weaving Social Media Into a Business Proposal Project,Xiaoli Li,"Given that students are enthusiastic about social media or even have expertise in some social media tools, the author decided to design a class project in her Writing for Careers (Business Communication) class that integrates social media in terms of content and project management. This article intends to describe such a class project design as well as the working process; reflect on such a practice by reviewing students’ feedback, examining the final products, and assessing the learning outcomes; and finally provide suggestions on how to improve this project."
Dead or Alive,Christina Decarie,"Information literacy is an essential skill for business communication students. Traditionally taught by librarians, there is a pressing need for all business instructors to incorporate informational literacy training into their courses. Moreover, students need to hone their research skills, moving beyond a dependence on Google and Wikipedia. This article describes an assignment that pushes students to be creative and dogged in their research, to think critically about the information they find, and to provide solutions and tools for fellow students for improving their research and critical thinking skills."
How Many “Friends” Do You Need? Teaching Students How to Network Using Social Media,"Michael Alan Sacks, Nikki Graves","Student reliance on social media is undeniable. However, while we largely regard social media as a new phenomena, the concepts underlying it come directly from social network theory in sociology and organizational behavior. In this article, the authors examine how the social network concepts of size, quality, complexity, diffusion, and distance determine the situational usefulness of social media tools such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. The authors also provide in-class and out-of-class teaching assignments that help students recognize the specific ways in which social networks can aid or hinder their professional endeavors."
Social Networks and the Desire to Save Face,"Michael A. Netzley, Akanksha Rath","For 5 years, corporate communication undergraduates have maintained a wiki as a final course and community service project. Using Web 2.0 platforms to crowdsource and curate content, they learn to employ online communications for work purposes. When the course was launched in 2007, the dominant social media narrative invited educators to embrace a technological optimism with subthemes of open communication, sharing, and co-creation. By 2011, student feedback had compelled the instructor to consider the limits of technological optimism and revise the course. Specifically, Singaporean students have displayed a need to save face online, which has led to a localized teaching approach."
Instructor Credibility Across Disciplines,"Carl Obermiller, Bryan Ruppert, April Atwood","Business communication instructors can face a unique set of challenges to maintain their credibility with students. Communication plays an important role in the instructor-student relationship, and students judge instructors’ ability to teach communication based on their ability to practice what they teach. The authors’ empirical study shows that students have higher expectations of their business communication instructors than they do of their other business instructors when it comes to their communication behaviors in and out of the classroom. The authors infer from the data that sensitivity to these expectations can improve student learning and instructor evaluations."
Student Interns’ Socially Constructed Work Realities,Kathy Barnett,"New employees, including college students, often experience expectation-reality gaps about work, making the assimilation process more difficult for all. This qualitative study explores the role of the internship in narrowing the work expectation-reality gap. This article addresses two research questions: (a) What do students learn about work through internships that they did not know before? (b) How is this new knowledge reflected in their advice to future interns? Analysis of 59 intern exit interviews or surveys reveals two categories of communication-related discovery that in turn influenced subsequent advice messages. Practical implications for business curriculum and career development programs are discussed."
A Process for Assessing and Improving Business Writing at the MBA Level,"Gary L. May, Margaret A. Thompson, Jennifer Hebblethwaite","Assurance of learning continues to be a hot topic in higher education. Both accreditation agencies and employers are asking a key question: Are we graduating students who actually have the knowledge and skills that we promise? This case study focuses on business writing in an MBA program and presents a prescriptive, five-step program to improve MBA students’ writing skills. The study provides example documents used in the assessment process and an example of data analysis used to “close the loop” in the assurance of learning cycle. The study concludes with lessons learned and recommendations for future improvements in the process."
Positive Organizational Behavior,"Sandra L. French, Tracey Quigley Holden","Most communication research on bad news messages focuses on crisis communication, where attention is often limited to image repair strategies. The authors argue that a key indicator of an organization’s effectiveness in communicating “bad news” messages is its organizational culture. Developing an organizational culture that values positive organizational behavior can transform the way that “bad news” messages are crafted and received in the workplace. In this article, the authors demonstrate how organizational leadership and practice from the positive organizational behavior perspective can assist with communicating “bad news” messages, particularly during organizational crises."
Introducing Plain Language Principles to Business Communication Students,Rachelle R. Greer,"In response to current federal mandates requiring selected businesses and government agencies to use plain language (PL) when reporting information to the public, this article advocates the introduction of PL principles into current business communication curricula. Despite recent PL mandates and advances, many current business textbooks and curricula omit PL principles. Students must become familiar with PL principles in their business communication courses in order to apply PL effectively in the workplace. To accomplish this goal, the author focuses on defining PL, outlining the history and recent developments of PL, and listing the resources and exercises instructors can use to incorporate PL principles into business communication courses."
The Case for “Living” Models,Valerie Creelman,"How best to teach and compose negative messages is a topic that continues to challenge and spark debate among business communication educators and researchers. Even where business communications textbooks emphasize the importance of context and audience analysis to determine whether to adopt a direct or indirect arrangement when expressing bad news, many still favour an indirect approach. In reviewing 50 years of negative news research, this article highlights the major concerns that continue to influence the debate as educators challenge and question existing models for addressing this rhetorically complex message genre."
An Analysis of Data Breach Notifications as Negative News,Jennifer R. Veltsos,"Forty-six states require organizations to notify users when personally identifiable information has been exposed or when the organization’s data security measures have been breached. This article describes a qualitative document analysis of 13 data breach notification templates from state and federal agencies. The results confirm much of the typical advice for negative messages, but they suggest that the direct pattern may be an effective way to inform users as required by law, to overcome optimism bias, and to overcome rational ignorance. When a buffer is used, writers should not be afraid to refer to the bad news."
"Selections From the ABC 2011 Annual Convention, Montreal, Canada",D. Joel Whalen,"The 12 Favorite Assignments featured in this article were presented at the 2011 Annual Convention of the Association for Business Communication (ABC), Montreal, Canada. A variety of learning objectives are featured: delivering bad news, handling difficult people, persuasion, reporting financial analysis, electronic media, face-to-face communication, and much more. Some Favorite Assignments take a full semester to complete; others can be done within a single class. Each assignment reflects the individual author’s passion for active learning that stimulates practical skill building, judgment, and communication skills. Additional teaching materials—instructions to students, stimulus materials, slides, grading rubrics, frequently asked questions (FAQs), and sample student projects—are posted on http://www.salesleadershipcenter.com/research.html#mfa12."
Strategies for Teaching Social and Emotional Intelligence in Business Communication,"Lucia Stretcher Sigmar, Geraldine E. Hynes, Kathy L. Hill","Incorporating social and emotional skills (EI) training into the business communication curriculum is important for preparing students to function effectively in a global workplace with its complex informal networks, intercultural issues, team emphasis, and participatory leadership. EI skills enhance communication behavior in work groups and improve the quality of student responses to various business scenarios. Scientific research indicates that modeling social and emotional behavior is key to acquiring competency in these skills. This article describes four classroom strategies for developing EI skills in business communication courses."
Poetry Recitation for Business Students,Beth Hoger,"Poetry recitation removes the distractions of creating and organizing original material so that business students can focus on presentation skills of delivery, confidence, and memory. Delivery includes articulation, emphasis, nonverbals, and presence. Confidence and memory development are complementary. Confidence comes from trusting the memory and memory adds confidence. Memory is treated as a larger skill for business, not as a crutch for presenting. Rationale, resources, implementation and evaluation for this assignment are all detailed."
Exploring Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Approaches to Business Communication Research,Rebecca Pope-Ruark,"With our core focus on teaching and scholarship, business communication teacher-scholars are well placed to become leaders in the international Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) movement. In this article, SoTL is defined and contextualized, three SoTL research approaches are introduced, and disciplinary research projects are suggested. A SoTL research agenda in business communication can improve our teaching practices, our students’ learning, and our disciplinary knowledge in very compelling ways."
The Anonymity Factor in Making Multicultural Teams Work,Roberta Wiig Berg,"A major purpose of courses in intercultural communication is often to improve students’ ability to perform well in situations with the potential to be both highly enlightening and highly difficult—in multicultural teams. This article reports the results of exercises in which members of a dysfunctional multicultural class were assigned to teams and given a task to perform in an anonymous, virtual-team setting, as well as in a real-team setting. Team members contributed in a much more balanced manner in the anonymous virtual-team exercise. However, team members nevertheless believed their input had been heard and appreciated in the real-team setting."
Teaching White Papers Through Client Projects,Russell Willerton,"White papers are increasingly prevalent in business and professional settings. Although textbook resources for white paper assignments are limited, a white paper assignment completed for a community client can provide a learning experience that students enjoy and that strengthens ties between the university and the community. This article describes a way to approach the white paper assignment in a communications-focused course and identifies resources to support white paper assignments."
Improving Employees’ Interpersonal Communication Competencies,Geraldine E. Hynes,"Companies that recognize the relationship between employee engagement and business success will seek ways to foster and facilitate workers’ emotional well-being. One way to encourage employee engagement is to provide training in interpersonal communication. This research analyzes what one U.S.-based company is doing to achieve that goal. The company and the evolution of its communication training program are described, with a focus on an interpersonal communication component. Methods used for evaluating learning outcomes are outlined, along with some results. Finally, this study proposes several implications of this case study for business communication professionals."
Positioning Résumés and Cover Letters as Reflective-Reflexive Process,Chalice Randazzo,"Although the résumé and cover letter genre is widely discussed in both popular and scholarly publications, discussion thus far has failed to acknowledge that the process of creating a résumé and cover letter has the potential for encouraging students’ reflective and reflexive capacities. This article suggests that business communication educators can realize this potential through three pedagogical changes: timing the assignment to coincide with reflective phases in the learning cycle, incorporating rhetorical context, and promoting abstraction and generalization. With these adjustments, the genre becomes a unique opportunity among reflective-reflexive documents because of its pervasiveness, timeliness, and rhetorical significance."
Toward Learner-Centered Teaching,"Karl L. Smart, Christine Witt, James P. Scott","Through the past several years, the emphasis in education has shifted from a teacher-centered to a learner-centered approach. Traditional teaching has too often been based on a passive lecture model, dependent on an expert teacher who funnels knowledge into the somewhat retentive minds of students. More current learning theory suggests a different role for teachers—that of facilitators. Based on research about how people learn, this article advocates that teachers use more active, inductive instruction in the classroom and demonstrates a student-centered approach using classroom examples implemented in a required, college-level business communication course."
Executive Perceptions of the Top 10 Soft Skills Needed in Today’s Workplace,Marcel M. Robles,"Hard skills are the technical expertise and knowledge needed for a job. Soft skills are interpersonal qualities, also known as people skills, and personal attributes that one possesses. Business executives consider soft skills a very important attribute in job applicants. Employers want new employees to have strong soft skills, as well as hard skills. This study identified the top 10 soft skills as perceived the most important by business executives: integrity, communication, courtesy, responsibility, social skills, positive attitude, professionalism, flexibility, teamwork, and work ethic."
Back to Our Roots,Rebecca Pope-Ruark,"This article argues for a scholarly research agenda in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) for the broad discipline of professional communication by distinguishing SoTL from other types of teacher-scholar practice, including anecdotal publications, action research, traditional educational research, and scholarly teaching. Doing so carefully positions SoTL as an extension of the pedagogical roots of business and technical communication and as a way to reinforce our teaching fortes, unite the fields within the discipline via research, and strengthen arguments for disciplinarity and academic respect."
Organizational and Supervisory Apology Effectiveness,"Ryan S. Bisel, Amber S. Messersmith","We synthesize the interdisciplinary literature into a heuristic for crafting effective organizational and supervisory apologies (the OOPS four-component apology). In the first experiment, we demonstrate how an offense committed by an organization is perceived to be more egregious than an offense committed by a friend or supervisor. Furthermore, results did not support that OOPS apologies are unequally effective if issued by a friend, supervisor, or organization. In the second experiment, we test OOPS apology-training effectiveness. Results indicated that trained participants crafted more effective apologies. Our apology heuristic is an innovation for training business communicators how to apologize effectively."
A Hybrid Recursive Model for Teaching and Learning Business Writing,Heidi Schultz,"To replicate the need for communication speed and effectiveness in the workplace, I have designed a successful business writing course based on a hybrid recursive model that combines prescriptive rhetorical patterns with a perceptive application of those patterns. The model draws inspiration from (a) current-traditional rhetoric, modified for a business context, to address the need to write quickly, which I label the “prescriptive phase,” and from (b) cognitive rhetoric, again modified for a business context, to address the need to write effectively, which I label the “perceptive phase.”"
Using Problem-Based Scenarios to Teach Writing,"Karl L. Smart, Nancy Hicks, James Melton","The ability to communicate effectively remains a critical skill for obtaining a job and achieving success in the workplace; however, many still lack these skills. In particular, graduates lack adequate writing skills. This article advocates the use of problem-based scenarios to teach writing, which focuses on authentic rhetorical framing similar to writing done in the workplace. A sample scenario is provided along with three responses, showing the type of issues involved in helping students develop writing skills appropriate to an organizational context."
A Heuristic Tool for Teaching Business Writing,Lorelei A. Ortiz,"To teach effective business communication, instructors must target students’ current weaknesses in writing. One method for doing so is by assigning writing exercises. When used heuristically, writing exercises encourage students to practice self-assessment, self-evaluation, active learning, and knowledge transfer, all while reinforcing the basics of good writing. Using writing exercises as a diagnostic or maintenance tool at different stages in the semester, in addition to the core assignments, can drastically improve undergraduate and graduate student writing and increase the probability that these students will transfer that writing knowledge into other courses and into their practices as professional writers in industry."
Using the Teaching Portfolio to Anticipate Programmatic Assessment,Kenneth R. Price,Portfolios have long been a staple in professional writing courses: both in employment materials assignments and in entire classes that ask students to reflect on their experiential learning. Portfolios may also be used effectively in business communication teaching methods courses. This article details the justification and methodology for having a teaching portfolio as the capstone assignment in a business communication pedagogy course. It also explains how this portfolio may be used to anticipate programmatic assessment and verification of entry-level business communication courses during the accreditation process.
Potential for Collaborative Writing in Professional Communication and Health Studies Through Service-Learning,"Sandra Hill, Paula Griswold","Two professors teaching in professional writing and health studies have incorporated service-learning projects into their courses and included similar writing goals. Though employing different methodologies, they saw similar outcomes. Through assessment of student reflections and discussions of course outcomes, both professors concluded that there is potential for collaborative service-learning projects between the two disciplines. This article discusses pedagogical approaches in the two courses, the theory and pedagogy on which the approaches are based, and practical ideas on how a collaborative professional writing/health studies service-learning project might be set up. Such ideas may provide a model for collaboration across disciplines."
Which CSR-Related Headings Do Fortune 500 Companies Use on Their Websites?,"Katherine Taken Smith, Julie J. Alexander","This article examines website headings used by Fortune 500 companies in their efforts to inform stakeholders about corporate social responsibility (CSR). Instead of using “Corporate Social Responsibility” as a heading, companies often use specific terms to identify various CSR initiatives. The purpose of this article is to identify common CSR-related headings that are currently used on Fortune 500 company websites. Data were collected from all Fortune 500 company websites. The websites were further analyzed according to manufacturing, retailing, and service industry. Interesting similarities and differences were found. This study provides guidance on articulating CSR-related activities to consumers, employees, and stakeholders."
Business Languages for Intercultural and International Business Communication,Judith Ainsworth,"Specialists in international education maintain that all undergraduates require contact with and understanding of other nations, languages, and cultures to develop intercultural communication skills. To determine if the business school at a small comprehensive university provides sufficient intercultural communication training, feedback from two surveys and an interview with the international business (IB) coordinator were analysed. Results revealed that the business school has implemented a multicomponent IB concentration, but that business language initiatives were unsustainable because of inadequate administrative commitment. Thus, efforts directed at internationalising the curriculum fail unless they are fully integrated into all programs and engage all stakeholders."
Business Communication Curricula Today,"Matthew R. Sharp, Eva R. Brumberger","This article reports the results of a study examining the business communication offerings at the top 50 undergraduate business schools, as identified in the Bloomberg Businessweek rankings for 2011. The study focuses on communication course requirements, sequences, and programs, as well as what areas typically receive the most coverage within courses. The data are compared with information from similar studies dating back to 1999 in order to assess the current status of business communication courses and programs within business curricula and to make suggestions for future development."
Assessing WAC Elements in Business Syllabi,"Maureen O’Day Nicolas, Samer Annous",This study investigates syllabi for evidence of the principles of writing across the curriculum (WAC) in courses offered by the Faculty of Business (FOB) at a university operating in a non–English-speaking country. The research analyzed all syllabi of FOB courses offered in the spring 2010 semester for evidence of WAC looking for indications of writing activities. The analysis focused on both expressive/informal and product/formal writing and discovered through the syllabi the intention of the instructor to incorporate writing. The findings suggest that these courses require little or no writing and therefore principles of WAC are not evident.
360-Degree Rhetorical Analysis of Job Hunting,"Huiling Ding, Xin Ding","This article proposes the use of a four-component multimodal employment project that offers students a 360-degree understanding of the rhetorical situations surrounding job searches. More specifically, we argue for the use of the four deliverables of written resumes and cover letters, mock oral onsite interview, video resume analysis, and peer critique of social media profiles in a widely taught employment project to help students better analyze the complicated rhetorical situations surrounding job applications and to facilitate better peer collaboration and serious revision of the two high-stakes documents of cover letters and resumes."
Curricular Implications of Virtual World Technology,"Dale Cyphert, M. Susan Wurtz, Leslie K. Duclos","As business organizations grow increasingly virtual, traditional principles of organizational communication require examination and modification. This article considers the curricular implications of the growing business uses of virtual world technology through three different lenses—students as employee-users, students as strategic designers and decision makers, and students as theorists. The instructor’s approach to communication principles relevant to persistent virtual worlds should be grounded in current and anticipated business applications. Emerging business practice provides guidance regarding the communication principles and skills that might be required of students entering careers in a contemporary business world of networked, digitized, and virtually enhanced communication."
Workplace Engagement and Generational Differences in Values,Nancy M. Schullery,"This article summarizes literature on workplace engagement, an issue that affects organizations’ financial results and individuals’ personal lives. The newest of the four generations in the workplace, Millennials, were recently shown to have different values than the other two prevalent generations. Surveys taken by 16,000 high school seniors of three generations on intrinsic, extrinsic, social, leisure, and altruistic values at work show only the altruistic value is not statistically different. When aggregated, these generational differences have noticeable practical impact. In the classroom, engagement is essential to learning. Examples of engaging activities that address the Millennials’ values are provided."
"Personal, Reflective Writing",Holly Lawrence,"The use of personal, reflective writing exercises is well documented in the disciplines of composition and management, and each discipline has been highly influential in establishing pedagogical practices in the business communication classroom. However, we see little evidence of the pedagogical practice, the use of personal reflective writing exercises, in the teaching of business communication. This article looks at pedagogy and theory that informs the use of personal, reflective writing exercises in composition and management and suggests the relevance of these same practices in business communication classrooms today. Building on relevant pedagogical theory and practice, the author also makes the claim that personal reflective writing exercises can make students better writers and more effective managers and leaders. The article concludes with sample exercises that readers might try in their own business communication classrooms."
Telling Tales at Work,Chulguen (Charlie) Yang,"This article explores the adaptive functions of storytelling in the workplace from an evolutionary perspective. Based on the analysis of ethnographic studies on hunter-gatherer and modern work organizations, this article claims that storytelling, as an adapted cognitive device, was selectively retained by natural and sexual selection, because of its survival and reproductive payoff. The narrative production through storytelling is a natural coping mechanism and has been functional in both old and new ways of working life under different ecological conditions. This article also highlights underlying adapted psychological mechanisms of storytelling and discusses some evolutionarily informed practical implications and pedagogical applications."
Writing Self-Efficacy and Written Communication Skills,Deanna DeBrine Mascle,"Writing is an essential professional skill. The goal of writing instruction in business communication classes is to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully meet future writing challenges. However, many writers struggle to transfer skills and knowledge from one context to another. The primary reason for this struggle is that despite years of writing instruction, most people are highly apprehensive about writing and do not consider themselves “writers.” Writing instruction typically does little to lessen writing apprehension, but fostering writing self-efficacy can both diminish writing apprehension and further writing development."
Graphic Presentation,"Jeremy C. Short, Brandon Randolph-Seng, Aaron F. McKenny","Graphic novels have been increasingly incorporated into business communication forums. Despite potential benefits, little research has examined the merits of the graphic novel approach. In response, we engage in a two-study approach. Study 1 explores the potential of graphic novels to affect learning outcomes and finds that the graphic novel was related to high levels of learning experiences. Study 2 compares the impact of graphic novels with that of traditional textbooks and finds that verbatim recognition was superior with graphic novel texts. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive examination of the graphic novel as a tool for effective business communication."
From Theory to Practice,"Tamara Aertsen, Koen Jaspaert, Baldwin Van Gorp","In this article, an educational project is described that was formulated with the aim to give master’s students in business communication the opportunity to experience how theory could be applied to shape practice. A 4-week project was developed in which students were urged to use communication theory and linguistic theory to manage the communication with respect to a simulated crisis at the university. The students were enrolled in collaborative learning teams. In this article, the architecture of the project is described, and drawing on an analysis of the students’ work and their evaluation of the project, its outcomes are discussed."
"Selections From the ABC 2012 Annual Convention, Honolulu, Hawaii",D. Joel Whalen,"The 13 Favorite Assignments featured here were presented at the 2012 Association for Business Communication (ABC) Annual Convention, Honolulu, Hawaii. A variety of learning objectives are featured, including the following: enhancing resume’s visual impact, interpersonal skills, social media, team building, web design, community service projects, and ethics. The authors share ideas for the classroom, for online instruction, and are taught in a single class or designed to consume an entire semester.

More excellent Favorite Assignment papers can be seen on the above webpage. This year, a bonus five authors have web..."
New Options for Usability Testing Projects in Business Communication Courses,Daphne A. Jameson,"The increasing availability of recording technologies makes it easier to include usability testing projects in business communication courses. Usability testing is a method of discovering whether people can navigate, read, and understand a print or electronic communication well enough to achieve a particular purpose in a reasonable time frame. Usability projects increase students’ knowledge and motivation by forcing them to experience the audience’s frustrations with poorly written and designed communications. By following the suggestions and examples provided, faculty can develop effective usability project materials and capitalize on new technologies for data collection and sharing."
A Contemporary Simulation Infused in the Business Communication Curriculum,"Meghann L. Drury-Grogan, Travis L. Russ","This research examines students’ reactions to a contemporary simulation infused in the business communication curriculum. Results show that students indicated the experience helped them learn how to work better as a team, how to maintain composure, how the business world works, and how to improve their communication. Students also verified the validity of the simulation, stating that it prepared them for the business world by providing them with a challenging yet positive experience to demonstrate learned business communication principles. Details about the pedagogical framework of the business communication simulation and possible explanations and implications behind the findings are discussed."
Updating Best Practices,Charlsye Smith Diaz,"The best practices presented in textbooks and professional publications provide separate guidelines for paper-based and electronic or “scannable” résumés. This article recommends changing these practices so that writers can prepare one résumé for both paper and electronic delivery. These recommendations focus on three areas. Résumés should be formatted based on eye-tracking research about on-screen reading. Specific guidelines should help writers decide when to include an objective or summary. Keywords should be prioritized over active verbs. Last, résumés still must be formatted for paper but designing for on-screen reading is now equally or more important, and best practices need to reflect this change."
Intercultural Communication Apprehension and Emotional Intelligence in Higher Education,"Lisa T. Fall, Stephanie Kelly, Patrick MacDonald, Charles Primm, Whitney Holmes","Given the expanding globalized workforce, business educators continue to seek new ways to prepare students for intercultural encounters. Although immersion in other cultures is the optimal strategy, this method is not always feasible. As such, educators seek other mechanisms to simulate intercultural experiences. This study examines emotional intelligence as a predictor of intercultural communication apprehension among university students (N = 425). Results indicate that three of the emotional intelligence subscales predict intercultural communication apprehension: emotionality, sociability, and self-control. These results support the premise that emotional intelligence manages and/or reduces intercultural communication apprehension and therefore should be integrated in business curriculum."
Perceptions of Civility for Mobile Phone Use in Formal and Informal Meetings,"Melvin C. Washington, Ephraim A. Okoro, Peter W. Cardon","We report our survey research about what American business professionals consider appropriate or civil mobile phone behavior during formal and informal meetings. The findings come from two of our recent research studies: an open-ended survey of 204 employees at a beverage distributor on the East Coast and a nationwide, random-sample survey of 350 business professionals in the United States. There were significant differences by age, group, gender, region, and income level. The differences between women and men were quite striking, with men nearly twice as likely to consider various mobile phone behaviors as acceptable in informal meetings."
Revisiting a Genre,Christopher Toth,"Infographics exist on nearly any topic you can imagine, proliferating in the digital age with social media. As this genre continues to explode in the business scene, business and professional communication instructors can no longer ignore showing their students infographics. After first defining the genre and outlining how it situates itself within business and professional communication, this article offers two approaches to increase awareness and exposure of infographics for students. The first focuses on an analysis assignment using infographics; the second focuses on a production assignment."
Voice Assessment of Student Work,"Barry Eckhouse, Rebecca Carroll","Although relatively little attention has been given to the voice assessment of student work, at least when compared with more traditional forms of text-based review, the attention it has received strongly points to a promising form of review that has been hampered by the limits of an emerging technology. A fresh review of voice assessment in light of recent technological developments strongly suggests that this form of review is now ready for broad adoption. Favorable student reception of voice assessment and its potential for raising instructor awareness around the review process itself argue further for considering it afresh."
MBA Students’ Workplace Writing,Paula Lentz,"Employers frequently complain about the state of their employees’ writing skills. Much of the current research on this subject explores workplace writing skills from the employer’s perspective. However, this article examines workplace writing from the employees’ perspective. Specifically, it analyzes MBA students’ responses to a course assignment in which they assessed their writing strengths and weaknesses and reflected on opportunities and threats to demonstrating good writing skills in the workplace. Results indicate employers must show that they value good writing and that writing skills must become the employee’s habit. Implications for business communication pedagogy are discussed."
Teaching Teamwork Through Coteaching in the Business Classroom,"Julie A. Kliegl, Kari D. Weaver","Business educators recognize the importance of developing teamwork as an employability skill. However, current methods used to teach teamwork have been met with mixed results from both students and educators. This article integrates research on the importance of teamwork, team development processes, and coteaching through examining a case study wherein coteaching was used as a means of conveying teamwork concepts to students. Coteaching is an alternate approach to teaching teamwork skills. In this case, the core competencies of shared values, complementary expertise, and the willingness to experiment were critical to forming and developing a functional teaching partnership."
"Three Sales Letter Themes: Taste It, Try It, Touch It","Marsha L. Bayless, Christine Monica Irvine, Mary Ellen Murray","Sales letters are one type of persuasive letter often assigned in the business communication classroom. This article dis cusses three approaches that require the student to either taste a product, try out an item, or touch an object before writing the sales letter to a prospective audience. The article describes pre-assignment activities, the assignment, and student reaction to the activities. Samples of handouts and student work are included."
"Grammatik 5® for Windows: Random Thoughts from a White, Male, Middle-Class German-Canadian",Richard Mende,"In this potentially controversial article, the author expresses grave concerns about Grammatik 5 for Win dows, both as a teaching tool and as a subtle means of propagating a political perspective. His objections to the software are on four grounds: lexicological, grammatical, structural, and political. The software presents users with feedback that is often wrong, frequently confusing, and sometimes irrelevant. Of particular interest is his discov ery that Grammatik 5 has been programmed to encourage ""political correctness."""
Teaching Company Research: Step-by-Step Instructions for Guiding Students Through a Library Assignment,"Paula R. Kaiser, Catherine K. Levinson","The responsibility for teaching students to research compa nies often falls to business communication instructors. While textbooks provide useful information related to company research, some instructors may need more detailed assistance in guiding their students' first efforts in researching compa nies. This article provides a step-by-step guide for research ing public and private companies. A sample assignment provides a context for practicing the research skills."
Helping Business Writing Students Improve as Document Designers,Jerome Curry,"Most introductory-level business writing texts fail to carry page design challenges beyond the chapter that outlines fundamentals. Clearly, if business writing instructors wish to help their students improve as designers, they must go beyond what textbooks offer. They must challenge their students repeatedly throughout the course. Three design challenges that are meant to be presented to stu dents over an eight-to-ten-week period are described."
Management Communication Strategy in Case Assignments: The Double-Message Approach,Betsy Stevens,"Case studies, used extensively in business communication classes, offer an advantage by presenting students with real-life situations to which they can respond using writ ten business genres. Cases, however, limited by their cryp tic and condensed nature, may not fully communicate the context of the event. Understanding context has become increasingly important as issues of race, gender, and mul ticultual communication have emerged in the workplace. The double-message approach offers a solution by asking students to write a context memorandum along with their response to the case protagonist."
Enhancing Business Communication with Group Decision Support Systems,"Milam Aiken, Jeanette Martin","Group Decision Support Systems are helping many orga nizations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of group meetings. In addition, multilingual Group Decision Support Systems can support groups using many differ ent languages by automatically translating group mem bers' comments. In this paper, we describe this new technology and demonstrate how it can enhance business communication."
Teaching Business Students to Write Performance Appraisals,"Sandra J. Nelson, Laura MacLeod","Since many business students will conduct performance appraisals in future employment, instruction on performance appraisals is appropriate for the business communication course. This article contains a discussion of a unit on perfor mance appraisals, including writing comments to support ratings, drawing conclusions concerning performance, and making recommendations to improve performance. An exam ple of an assignment that requires students to complete an appraisal form is provided. Last, suggested teaching tech niques are given for the appraisal unit."
Adapting Corporate Presentation Skills Training Practices for Use in a University Classroom,Judith A. Kolb,"Both corporate and university sectors are engaged in the teaching of communication courses. As someone who has taught in both settings, I believe that trainers and profes sors have much to gain from pooling ideas. With this in mind, I first observed and then participated in a week- long ""Presentation Skills"" workshop taught in a Fortune 500 company to determine what aspects of that program might be transplanted to a traditional university public speaking course. I then took ideas gained from the work shop and applied them to the public speaking classes I taught at a western university. This article is an examina tion and discussion of this process."
A Case Study in Business Writing: An Examination of Documents Written by Executives and Managers,"Leona M. Gallion, C. Bruce Kavan",This study examines the types of documents written by 23 executives/managers in two different companies—a col lection agency division of a large service company and a mid-sized professional liability insurance company. Implications for business writing courses are given.
"A Short Classroom Unit, but a Significant Improvement, in Listening Ability","Thomas L. Means, Gary S. Klein","The purpose of this study was to determine if a unit on listening that consumes little class time would signifi cantly increase listening skills. This research design was basically pretest/treatment/posttest. Excluding the pre- and posttest, the treatment takes only 80 classroom min utes. The Watson-Barker Listening Test—Video Version was used as the measurement instrument. The data revealed that the average listening skills of participants increased over 21 %. The greatest improvement (over 40%) took place in two listening skill areas—evaluating mes sage content and understanding meaning in conuersation. A significant improvement (over 20%) occurred in under standing and remembering lectures."
Teaching Listening: Some Thoughts on Behavioral Approaches,Judi Brownell,"This paper provides an overview of the issues involved in providing listening instruction to those who work or who are preparing to work in organizations. Questions are posed regarding the nature of listening and listening instruction. A behavioral approach is suggested, and the benefits and concerns regarding this perspective are examined."
Résumé Content and Format—Do the Authorities Agree?,"Beverly Culwell-Block, Jean Anna Sellers","A review of business communication textbooks was con ducted to determine, according to the textbook authors, what information should and should not be included on the résumé, the format, and the importance of the overall appearance. Although the research shows there is agree ment among the textbook authors on many issues, there is also disagreement in several areas. But the message is clear—with the increasing competition in the employment market, college graduates would be well advised to develop a résumé that is complete, concise, clear, and error-free."
Augmenting Instruction in Business Communication Courses with the Internet,Lance Cohen,"Faced with shrinking budgets and changing standards at their colleges and universities, instructors of business communication are looking for new ways to prepare stu dents for careers in business. Using computer-mediated technologies, instructors can develop activities outside the classroom to motivate and inform students. Augmenting business communication courses with e-mail and Internet protocols, instructors can reach larger segments of their classes, stimulate discussions, create simulations, and strengthen their relationships with students. Using imagi native techniques, students and instructors can work together to develop a new kind of educational community whose communications are mediated by computers."
Written Communication Skills of International Business Persons,"Mona Casady, Lynn Wasson","To determine written communication skill requirements, responsibilities, and deficiencies of employees in interna tional businesses, a nationwide survey of key personnel administrators in selected companies was conducted. The findings indicate that (a) major writing responsibilities exist in various departments within international compa nies, (b) the variety of documents produced are similar to those in domestic businesses, (c) most written do cuments are produced at the keyboard or in longhand, and (d) the major writing deficiency is mechanics. Screening tech niques employed to assess writing abilities before hiring individuals most often include a review of the application materials. Most reported that no specific communication problems exist because nearly all business is conducted in English. Yet the representatives who were interviewed had recommendations for ensuring successful international written communications."
Ethos at Sea,Robert Shenk,"A study of writing in the United States Navy indicates the wide usefulness of the rhetorical concept of ethos. Although almost never formally taught, the concept is continually being rediscovered and applied within a wide variety of naval contexts, from naval personnel evaluations to ship- repair reports. But ethos is still too seldom consciously present or habitually applied in the naval profession. And, as the Tailhook episode has recently demonstrated, a lack of such understanding can sometimes have adverse effects on the credibility of the Navy as a whole."
Getting the Big Picture: Writing to Learn in a Finance Class,"Susan Hall, Theresa Tiggeman","This paper describes a project incorporating writing-to- learn activities into an introductory finance class. Such activities use writing informally as a vehicle to promote student learning. Examination of the students' brief papers showed that students became less likely to skip theory and go to canned formulas and that they took more responsibil ity for their work. For instructors, the project was beneficial because it enabled them to tailor class presentations more precisely to students' actual comprehension of course material."
Integrating Business Communication Skills into a Buyer-Behavior Course Project,"Alan P. Wunsch, Chuck Tomkovick","Marketing educators have long recognized the need for strengthening their students' business communication skills. Recruiters routinely consider superior communica tions skills as essential hiring criteria when filling entry- level marketing positions. Additionally, marketing students consistently rate communication-intensive business courses as among those most helpful to them in preparing for their business careers. This paper discusses an undergraduate buyer-behavior course project targeted at improving stu dents' business communication skills through a team- teaching project. The paper highlights the value of integrating written, oral, and electronic communications pedagogy with buyer-behavior course instruction and then outlines the project from a ""how-to-do-it"" perspective."
Self-Assessment of Com munication Behavior: An Experiential Learning Exercise for Intercultural Business Success,"Jensen J. Zhao, Calvin Parks","This self-assessment is an experiential learning exercise designed for both corporate training and classroom. With Kolb's experiential learning model as a theoretical base, the self-assessment questionnaire in the exercise was developed on the basis of seven. dimensions of communication compe tence identified and confirmed by various empirical studies as predictors of intercultural business success. After com pleting this exercise, students should be able to (a) identify their communication behavior in intercultural interactions, (b) be aware of their communication competence level in intercultural interactions, and (c) increase their under standing of the relationship between communication behav ior and intercultural business management success."
Diversity Training: Effects of an Intervention Treatment on Nonverbal Awareness,"Jean A. Mausehund, Susan A. Timm, Albert S. King",The diversity of society today requires people to interact with others who have different cultural backgrounds. The simplest communication can be complicated by nonverbal factors. This study used a pretest-posttest design to deter mine the effect of an intervention treatment consisting of students viewing pictures of people and identifying attrib utes based solely on what they see. Then in groups the students discussed their varying interpretations. The findings were that the treatment made students more aware of nonverbal factors and how they are involved in interper sonal communication.
Teaching the Art of the Memo: Politics and Precision,H. William Rice,"In order to reproduce the politically charged environment of most corporations, I turn my class into a company. Using previously designated study groups, I make one the presi dent, another the vice president, and a final one the man ager of operations. Then I give them a problem which they can handle only through memos. Outside of class, they communicate by fax machines. Inside of class, they read and discuss each other's memos. This assignment enables the instructor to drop out of the role of lecturer as students discover for themselves the complex interaction between a writer and an audience."
"Meeting Workplace Needs in an Introductory Business Writing Course: A Tale of a Classroom Corporation and a ""Boss"" Instructor",Mary Sue Garay,"This paper shows instructors how playing the role of a boss can lead students to write, speak, and behave more profes sionally. The course accomplishes this transformation by changing the academic mindsets, conventions, and actions of both instructor and students. Instead of academic policies to govern a class, workplace conventions operate. In a reciprocal fashion, instructors assume that students' assignments represent the instructor's competence to upper management, and thus instructors ""invest""themselves in student work beyond traditional academic obligations. The paper also critiques the ""boss"" approach as well as provides assignment topics, evaluation guidelines, and specific descriptions of some assignments."
Adapting Composition Theory to the Business Communication Course,"Janet K. Winter, Esther J. Winter",Composition research provides a vast field of information from which business communication instructors can draw. Major changes in techniques for responding to student writing include teaching the process of writing and ways to teach grammar.
Business Communication Technologies: A New Course,"Phillip G. Clampitt, Tim Meyer","This article describes a new course that focuses on the impact of evolving communication technologies on business. Two core questions are addressed in the class: First, how does a manager or employee choose the appropriate channel for a given communication situation? Second, how does an organization choose which technologies are appropriate for its business needs? In the course, we answer those questions by examining strategic models, assessing specific technologies, and presenting case studies. The article discusses these ideas and evaluates the effectiveness of the course."
Building a Model for Distance Collaboration in the Computer-Assisted Business Communication Classroom,"Elizabeth Sanders Lopez, Edwin Nagelhout","Traditionally, research about collaboration in business communication classes has focused on small-group interaction and peer review of documents. Yet, computer classrooms and electronic networks used for teaching business communication today are affecting how traditional collaboration works and are opening up new possibilities for collaborative activity. One exciting possibility is using network technology to promote collaboration beyond the four walls of a single classroom. This article outlines a model for distance collaboration between business writing classrooms using network technology and discusses new ways to teach national and international audience awareness, problem solving, and the contextual nature of cases."
Group Writing: Student Perceptions of the Dynamics and Efficiency of Groups,"Janet K. Winter, Joan C. Neal","Understanding student perceptions of group work should help educators prepare students to be effective group members in the classroom and at work. This study ascer tained student perceptions of their learning and achievement in group situations. The following correlations were determined: (a) There was a relationship between student grades and perceptions of the writing quality as well as perceptions of the amount learned about group processes; (b) there was no correlation between grades and student opinions of the quantity of work achieved, the type of person who hindered the group the most, and whether the student enjoyed the group work."
Tapping Campus Talent for the Collegiate Business Communication Course: A Guide to Guest Speakers,Mary Ellen Nourse,"Since ""variety is the spice of life,""guest speakers can add an element of enthusiasm and interest in the business communication classroom. Individuals from departments as diverse as home economics, research and development, and academic computing can be approached as potential guest speakers for the undergraduate course. Experts from the campus community can be tapped to lend expertise and insights on many topics usually included in the business communication curriculum."
Challenging Students to Respond to Multicultural Issues: The Case-Study Approach,Helen M. Sharp,"Business communication and technical writing students face a new workplace challenge: responding to problems that reflect a multicultural dimension and involve business- people whose perspectives, values, and traditions are not Western. Case studies are a good teaching strategy to introduce multicultural issues in business communication. Case studies involve students in group settings and demand both problem-solving and human-relations skills. Adding discussion questions to case-study problems prompts student responses, and assigning a follow-up progress report or memorandum ties the case-study reviews to course goals. This article includes both a description of the assignment and two timely case-study samples."
A Graduate Communication Course for an Era of Global Commerce: A Case Study,John J. Cronin,"This article describes the development of a communication course for graduate business students that recognizes the emergence of global commerce using high-technology communication, while not ignoring fundamental skills. A ""diagnostic assessment center"" activity measures student abilities at the start of the course and again at the end. Oral and written skill-building and instruction in technologi cally mediated and intercultural communication are features of the course. The course was offered on an experi mental basis, and student progress and reactions to the course were carefully monitored. I explain the rationale behind the course content, evaluate the results, and offer advice to other schools designing such a course."
The Rising Tide of Estuary English: The Changing Nature Of Oral British Business Communication,James Calvert Scott,"Estuary English is a combination of nonregional and local southeastern English pronunciation and intonation that lies between R. P. English and London street speech and is sweeping across the United Kingdom, including its business community. This article identifies characteristics of Estuary English, documents the usage of Estuary English within the British business community, describes the milieu that causes Estuary English to be acceptable in the British business community, speculates about the future of Estuary English in the British business community, identifies the implications of Estuary English for business communicators, and discusses the implications of Estuary English for business communication teachers and consultants."
Applicant Appearance and Selection Decision Making: Revitalizing Employment Interview Education,Richard J. Ilkka,"As a topic within the larger corpus of materials on selection interviewing, applicant appearance has been addressed through advice giving, folk wisdom, and other prescrip tions. As presented, such materials tend to undermine opportunities for issue identification and assessment. Through review and interpretation of that employment interview research which addresses the relationship between applicant appearance and interviewer selection decisions, the purpose of this paper is to encourage those who teach, train, and counsel others on employment inter viewing to devote more studied attention to appearance issues and ethics. To that end, five instructional proposi tions are offered. Each proposition is developed through review of related research and then capped by instructional observations."
Enhancing Communication and Interactional Effectiveness with Mexican-American Trainees,"Kerry D. Carson, Paula Phillips Carson, Charles Irwin","Applying an international framework of work-related values, we offer practical suggestions for improving the effectiveness of training initiatives directed at Mexican- Americans. Specifically, it is recommended that those who train workers of Mexican descent (a) emphasize considerate behavior, (b) use encouragement techniques, (c) avoid public confrontation, (d) maintain a respectful distance with trainees, (e) foster participation, (f) offer collaborative team projects, (g) inspire ongoing education, (h) formally recog nize program completion, (i) allow ample time for topic coverage, (j) be sensitive to the status of women, (k) avoid blaming students for training failures, (l) settle conflicts amicably, and (m) provide guidance and structure for the participants. Since productive organizations must assume the responsibility for training employees when the prepara tory education system fails, implications for universities serving Mexican-American populations are also offered."
Audiotaped Feedback in Business Writing: An Exploratory Study,"C. Glenn Pearce, R. Jon Ackley","This four-year exploratory study was designed to investigate whether augmenting written comments on students' busi ness writing assignments with audiotaped remarks would lead to improved feedback, context, and performance; save time; and motivate student writers. The results showed that all factors improved except time, which could not be com pared directly to the results of previous studies."
Voice-Graded Business Communication Documents,Doris A. Van Horn-Christopher,Business communication instructors are often overwhelmed by the task of grading writing assignments. Instructors of writing are often frustrated by the complexities of the critiquing process. This article explores the benefits of using a uoice-graded writing approach which offers instructors an opportunity to engage in virtual office critiquing of student assignments.
Incorporating Electronic Mail into the Business Communication Course,"Karen S. Nantz, Cynthia L. Drexel","E-mail is the primary communication vehicle for the information superhighway. Unfortunately, e-mail education is focusing on the hardware and software issues without regard for the requisite communication skills. To be effective electronic communicators, students need training in understanding the electronic organizational hierarchy and electronic communication volume and costs; selecting the appropriate media; and evaluating message permanence, security, ownership, and privacy. Including targeted exercises in the business communication class can enhance students' understanding of e-mail."
"Executive Speech Coaching: An On-Site, Individualized, Abbreviated Course in Public Speaking",Stephen D. Boyd,"Corporate executives are often plagued with poor presentation skills, and the most time-efficient, customized solution is often individual coaching. This article, written by a practicing corporate speech. coach, describes a three-session approach to corporate speech coaching that has helped speakers improve on more than a hundred different occasions. It discusses optimal time schedules for coaching, what should be covered in individual sessions, how coaching should differ for speakers seeking to improve their skills in general and speakers working on a specific speech, and exercises to address specific presentation problems."
Adapting Cooperative Learning Strategies to Facilitate Ethics Discus sions Using E-Mail,"George S. Peek, Maria L. Roxas, Lucia E. Peek","This paper reports on a project in which students discussed an ethical dilemma using Internet e-mail as the medium of communication. The assignment requires both informal and formal document development in a team environment and uses cooperative learning strategies to assure full participa tion by all students. Students thus have the advantage of discussing an important current business issue, are facili tated in this discussion by the use of structured learning techniques, are required to exercise their thinking and writ ing skills in a variety of ways, and in many cases must acquire new technical and intellectual skills for communi cation across the Internet."
Using the Internet in Written Business Communication,"Zane K. Quible, Eric J. Ray","The Internet already has become a pervasive force in our society, and projections are that it will continue to become even more so in the future. We educators need to be sure we are preparing our students adequately to use the rich resources found on the Internet. The purpose of this article is to help business communication instructors become more familiar with the Internet and to discuss ways its use- through several scenarios - can be incorporated into writ ten business communication courses."
The Status of Computer Use in Business Commu nication Instruction,"Sandra J. Nelson, Douglas C. Smith, Kenneth R. Mayer, William P. Galle","The results of an ABC Undergraduate Studies Committee survey of members to determine the status of computer use in business communication courses are presented in this article. The majority of business communication instructors require students to complete all assignments on the com puter, and some instructors provide software training. Stu dents predominantly are using WordPerfect on networked IBM or IBM-compatible computers in labs managed by the college."
Defining Institutional Problems: A Heuristic Procedure,Bruce McComiskey,"This essay explores heuristic uses of Kenneth Burke's pen tad of dramatistic terms for defining institutional problems. Answering questions about institutional problems arranged according to Burke's pentad, students learn to incorporate multiple perspectives into their problem statements provid ing with them a socially inclusive foundation for problem solving reports."
An Integrated Approach to Introducing Research Methods in Required Business and Technical Writing Courses,Linda Loehr,This paper presents a classroom-tested method of present ing a variety of research materials and methods for optimal effectiveness. The integrated approach offers the opportunity for both instructors and their students to share responsibil ity for creating updated and useful courses that explore communication issues and offer practice in research. The suggested approach is multidimensioned but flexible and modular for ease in adaptation.
Enhancing the Student Listening Skills and Environment,"C. Glenn Pearce, Iris W. Johnson, Randolph T. Barker",This article reports the results of an investigation using an interactive approach to teaching listening skills that appears to be ideal for a business communication class. The authors describe their experiences with integrating listen ing activities into the content of an undergraduate organi zational behavior course. The conclusion is drawn that this can be done quite successfully.
Business Etiquette: What Your Students Don't Know,"Jean Mausehund, R. Neil Dortch, Paula Brown, Carl Bridges","Recent developments in the workplace have supported the need for more awareness of business etiquette, especially by new employees entering the workforce. This study was com pleted to determine the current level of etiquette awareness possessed by students enrolled in business communication courses at three AACSB institutions. The findings indicate that students are most concerned with issues related to job interviews, interpersonal relationships, and social issues and least concerned with intercultural issues."
The Impact of Conflict- Generating Techniques on Student Reactions and Decision Quality,"Granger Macy, Joan C. Neal",This study examined the effectiveness of conflict-generating decision-making techniques in the college classroom. Utiliz ing constructive conflict in classroom exercises may affect decision-making quality and student reactions. This study of undergraduate and graduate business students found significant difference in both the quality of the decisions and in student reactions to the techniques. The findings and discussion indicate the potential for appropriate use of structured decision-making techniques in the classroom.
Capacity for Empathy: Confronting Discrimina tion in Managing Multi cultural Work Force Diversity,Albert S. King,"This commentary focuses exclusively on problems of dis crimination as a major obstruction in managing diversity and incorporates an experiential training exercise for con fronting discrimination to better understand the difficulties in ""going beyond equality"" in managing diversity. The exer cise communicates the needed capacity for empathy or ability to cope with the emotional reactions of unequal treat ment that inevitably occur when socially or ethnically dif ferent people work together in organizations. The exercise and results of a recent field study reported herein focus on traditional forms of black and white discrimination. How ever, the procedure and instrument are general and may be modified to fit unique situations."
Business Communication Competencies Needed by Employees as Perceived by Business Faculty and Business Professionals,Karen K. Waner,"Implementation of total quality management and continu ous process improvement require validation of competencies by an institution's customers. This study was designed to determine if business faculty and business professionals perceive (a) business writing skills, (b) oral/interpersonal skills, (c) basic English skills, and (d) other business com munication abilities with the same degree of importance. Four one-way analyses of variance revealed no significant difference between 35 business professionals and 30 busi ness faculty concerning the four areas. However, when the 50 competencies within the four areas were ranked, some visible differences occurred in using the telephone and intercom, asking questions, and applying confidentiality."
International Business Writing Projects: Learning Content Through Process,"Frances J. Ranney, Kevin M. McNeilly",A project undertaken by members of the marketing and English departments in a midwestern university incorporates writing assignments into an intro ductory course in international business. This discussion of course goals and writing projects shows that attention to writing can increase the amount of time students devote to learning course content.
Teaching Managerial Communication to ESL and Native-Speaker Undergraduates,Mary Jane curry,"Management students need to learn both analytic and communication skills to be successful in the university and at work. Communicative methods used to teach English as a Second Language (ESL), such as collaborative learning, dialogue journals, peer review, and oral presentations, can be adapted readily to teaching analytical and communication skills to native and nonnative speakers of English. ESL strategies work well to enable learners to analyze readings and form and communicate well-developed opinions in the context of case studies and media critiques used in business communication."
Communication Challenges and Needs: Perceptions of MBA Students,"Lamar Reinsch, Jr, Annette N. Shelby","We asked each student enrolled in a graduate-level management communica tion course to describe in wrzting a work-related communication episode that had challenged him or her. Students reported most difficulties in face-to-face oral events, particularly when required to interact with someone in a different organization or with someone who ranked higher in the organization. Students also identified communication-related needs (for example, improved self-confidence and persuasiveness). Our results indicate that graduate management communication courses should include oral communication and should not conceptualize oral communication exclusively in terms of formal presentations."
The Writing of Nurse Managers: A Neglected Area of Professional Communication Research,Lee A. Spears,"The practice and teaching of nurse management writing has received little attention in professional communication journals. This study is based on sec ondary research, examination of documents written by nurse managers, and interviews with 54 nurse managers and 13 nurse educators. It indicates that writing a variety of business communications is a crucial career task jor nurse managers, directly affecting their professional power. However, most nurse managers interviewed believed their undergraduate education had not pre pared them adequately for their workplace writing and perceived a need for professional writing instruction in four-year nursing programs."
Job-Refusal Letters: Readers' Affectiue Responses to Direct and Indirect Organizational Plans,"Gwendolyn N. Smith, Rebecca F. Nolan,  Yong Dai","The affective responses of readers to job-refusal letters using direct and indirect approaches were investigated. Subjects were requested to rate organizational plan on 19 dependent measures. Results indicated that the direct job-refusal letter was preferred. It was viewed as more efficient, valuable and straightforward than the indirect approach. These findings are in conflict with current literature favoring the indirect approach for conveying negative information."
"New Corporate Practice, New Classroom Pedagogy: Toward a Redefinition of Management Communication",James R. Rubin,"Just as the challenge in a global economy is to develop new frameworks and then communicate them effectively, our challenge is to prepare students for negotiating wholly new communication challenges. Communication is much more than expressing the content of other ""real"" business disciplines clearly. Language and image have become a crucial part of creating and managing contemporary corporate culture; thus, we must expand the teaching of man agerial communication to include corporate communication. To describe ""communication,"" we must also employ words such as ""critical thinking"" and ""flexibility."" Communication is integral to the process of problem solving in the team-oriented workplace."
Communication Instruction in MBA Programs: A Survey of Syllabi,"Judith Bogert, David Butt","A survey of syllabi of MBA communication courses suggests that the ""typi cal"" MBA course focuses on skill development and integrates both speaking and writing, often with emphasis on speech. It builds problem solving and strategic communication skills through experiential learning gained in work shops, case studies, or field experiences. Current trends favor integration of communication courses into a unified core."
Graduate Business Students' Preferences for the Managerial Communication Course Curriculum,"Geraldine E. Hynes, Vinita Bhatia","The purpose of this study was to determine graduate business students' pref erences for the business communication course curriculum. Two hundred fifty- five graduate business students who had taken a core course in managerial communication were surveyed, 86% of whom are employed. The most highly rated course topics were making presentations, writing memos and letters, lis tening and interpersonal communication, impromptu speaking, and business report formats. The topics rated least important were international business communication, using technology, and managing diversity. The most fre quently suggested additional topics were job interviews, team building, writing manuals/policies/procedures, and ethics."
An MBA Communication Program in an Entirely Integrated Management Core,"Kathleen Kelly, Sydel Sokuvitz","We describe the communication component in a first-year MBA program that has been entirely integrated. In this integrated program, no courses, per se, exist; rather, the year's curriculum is built around stages in the business devel opment cycle. We first consider the choices that a program developer has to make about whether communication instruction will be reguired or elective, with or without credit, in the form of courses or workshops, and independent of or integrated with the rest of a business program. We then describe the com munication program, discuss the challenges of embarking on an integrated project, and suggest strategies for meeting them."
The GMAT Analytical Writing Assessment: Opportunitw or Threat for Management Communication?,"Priscilla S. Rogers, Jone Rymer","Instituted as a regular part of the GMAT in October 1994, the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) has the potential to serve as a diagnostic tool in MBA programs. This article describes the new test and reviews the uses of the AWA scores and essays that have significant ramifications for management communication. It concludes by suggesting why it is vital for communication instructors to become involved in decisions about how to use the A WA results."
Preparing MBA Students for the World of Professional Communication,Aline Wolff,An analysis of a large-scale professional communication project helps to define relevant managerial communication tasks; the project exemplifies the type of projects that graduating students will be expected to collaborate on or to manage successfully. The implications of this project for teaching manager ial communication to MBA students and recommended applications for inte grating work world tasks into the curriculum are also discussed.
The Communication Audit: A Framework for Teaching Management Communication,"Annette N. Shelby, N. Lamar
Reinsch, Jr","This article describes a communication audit project used in a graduate-level management communication course. We review some of the literature con cerning communication audits, explain why and how we use an audit in our classes, and describe specific audit-related assignments. While a challenging assignment both for student and professor, the audit is—in our judgment— clearly worth the effort."
Teaching Communication with Ethics-Based Cases,Betsy Stevens,This article focuses on the importance of presenting ethics and communica tion as twin concepts in the management communication class. It underscores the increasing importance and complexity of ethical issues and presents two cases that the instructor can use for analysis and discussion. The cases address two contemporary issues—harassment in the workplace and the consumption of alcohol by pregnant women. Both have implications for business profes sionals and allow students a chance to analyze their views and make decisions about communication strategies.
Native and Nonnative Student Writers,"Ron Featheringill, Jean Fuller, Gayle Vogt","We assert that schools and textbook publishers ineffectively emphasize gram mar. To see if traditional instruction in grammar prepares students for busi ness communication classes and the corporate world, we investigated specific writing skills of both native and nonnative business students. Although most students passed objective grammar and punctuation tests—the two groups showed no statistical differences—some cannot write. High schools, the study found, pass these students. The university also passes writing-deficient stu dents on to employers who must train them. We searched for reasonable solu tions to reduce the number of graduates who lack English skills for the workplace."
On Writing Well: An E-Mail Dialogue,"Dan Dieterich, Joel Bowman","Defining ""writing well"" is a matter of critical importance. We in ABC announce to the academic community and the public that we help students acquire skills they need to ""write well"" once they leave our campuses. Yet we have not reached consensus on what it means to write business correspon dence well. This article explores the concept of writing well, based on an exchange of opinions on the BIZCOM listserv on the Internet. It also illus trates the influence of electronic mediation on the communication process. We offer it here with the hope of encouraging further discussion of both topics: writing well and electronic mediation."
Human Factors in High-Tech Writing: Targeting the Right Tool for Professional Development,Louise Rehling,"Practitioners, students, and instructors of business communication can benefit from learning new professional technologies; but choosing among them may be difficult. This article provides a method, based on human factors, for help ing individuals with that choice. The first step is to complete a self-assessment questionnaire ranking preferences among forms, industries, techniques, roles, and purposes for writing. Then, individuals can match those preferences to typ ical expectationsfor each of several new text technologies: structured on-line documentation markups, help screens and interactive tutorials, and multime dia presentations. With that information, individuals can choose training in a technology that suits them."
Introducing Realism into Business Writing: Extended Conflict with a Hostile Audience,Jerome Curry,"While business writing textbooks generally do an adequatejob of helping instructors introduce real-life challenges into the classroom, there are at least two that they tend to slight or overlook. One is an encounter with a hostile, closed-minded audience, and the other is an extended conflict. An exercise that provides students with the practice they need in dealing with both of these challenges is described. Also, the method of grading the exercise is outlined, and the exercise's benefits are listed."
Skills Versus Apprehension: Empirical Euidence on Oral Communication,"David R. Fordham, Alexander L. Gabbin","Regardless of their oral communication ability, students must be willing to use their communication skills to be successful in business professions. A pro gram of study that addresses communication skills may not satisfactorily address the apprehension students may feel about communicating. In this study we administered the Personal Report of Communication Appreliension (PRCA) to 84 accounting seniors at an institution whose curriculum requires significant communication skills training and practice. We conclude that busi ness educators must pay special attention to communication apprehension separate from, and in addition to, communication skills."
Professional Advisory Boards: Fostering Communication and Collaboration Between Academe and Industry,Patricia Dorazio,"To make the technical communication program at SUNY Institute of Technol ogy at Utica/Rome successful and to give students an advantage of working with practicing professionals, the faculty thought it wise to add an advisory board composed of professionals, managers, and others associated with profes sional and technical communication. This paper describes the program, the board's contributions, and the benefits received by the students, the program, and the board members themselves."
Using Case Studies for International Business Communication Training,Jensen J. Zhao,"Business students must possess the abilities of discovery, problem solving, and collaboration in international and cross-cultural business communication and management when entering a competitive, knowledge-based global econ omy. This paper describes how the case method can be used in business com munication classes to help students develop such important abilities. First, the paper defines the instructional rationale and the case-selection criteria. Then, the paper offers a step-by-step approach using a current international busi ness communication case as an example for case study activities."
Surrounded by Predators? Think Fast!,"Patricia A. Merrier, Virginia T. Katz","Simulations have been shown to be an effective method of providing students with real-life experiences while in the comfortable, secure setting of the class room. This article describes how a news conference simulation involving stu dents from two collegiate units is being used to prepare business students to ""think on their feet."""
The Depiction of Female and Male Professionals in Business Communication Textbooks,"Paula Pomerenke, Iris I. Varner, Suzanne Mallar","This study of textbooks in business communication focused on the number of times men and women were shown in photographs and the professional roles implied by their appearance and demeanor. While the numbers were in bal ance, the physical appearance and role portrayal perpetuated traditional stereotypes of men and women in the workplace."
Student Perceptions of the Value of a Prewriting Problem-Solving Plan,Janet K. Winter,"This study attempted to determine student perceptions of the value of using a prewriting problem-solving plan and its relationship to their success in writ ing. The business communication students in the study felt that the plan was beneficial, particularly for persuasive messages, individual writing, and small- group writing. In addition, participants seemed to feel that the plan was worth preparing even when not required as part of the assignment. The results sug gest that the problern-solving plan can be a useful tool for complicated assign ments and group work but that it should probably be optional for simple assignments."
Student and Instructor Use of Comments on Business Communication Papers,"Janet K. Winter, Joan C. Neal, Karen K. Waner","Writing comments on student papers takes tremendous effort, and this study attempted to determine how students use these comments, the importance of the comments, and methods to encourage students to use comments. The results revealed that students' course grades did not correlate with their use of comments; however, students were likely to review comments if they had to rewrite assignments. Significant differences existed between course grades and these variables: (a) how well students read comments, (b) how useful com ments were, (c) how well students understood comments, and (d) how likely students were to get help in understanding comments."
Faculty Perceptions of Students' Business Communication Needs,Susan Plutsky,"Today's student populations comprise more minority students, more students for whom English is a second language, and more older students than in the past. These changes prompted this descriptive study in which business faculty members' perceptions about the business commumcation curriculum are examined. Faculty perceive their students to have problems with basic writing skills as well as with sophisticated writing concepts and techniques. Faculty seem to agree on the content that should be included in a business communi cation course. As a result, guidelines are recommended for those who revise the business communication course."
Using Consulting Projects to Teach Critical- Thinking Skills in Business Communication,Clive Muir,"There is more to successful communication than learning the styles and proce dures often found in the traditional business communication syllabus. In this article, I discuss the benefits of using a critical-thinking approach to helping students to understand the complex social and political environment in which business communication is practiced. I explain how communication consult ing projects can be used to examine the context of organizational communica tion. Finally, I discuss the implications for teaching business and technical communication using a real-world, critical approach."
Interactive Distance Learning: Perspective and Thoughts,"Randolph T. Barker, Charles L. Holley","Faculty, student, delivery, and university issues associated with distance learn ing as well as implementation and monitoring strategies require special atten tion if optimal benefits are to be produced. Communication faculties can play an important role in the success of this approach. This paper addresses the efforts at one school of business in developing an approach for program deliv ery through interactive distance learning."
Groupware and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work in the College Classroom,"Lynne M. Scalia, Benjamin Sackmary","Groupware is a recent development in the on-going search to improve corpo rate communication and decision-making processes. This study examines a classroom application of groupware for computer-supported cooperative work, consisting of problem solving, decision making, and development of group reports. Survey results indicate that student groupware users are generally sat isfied with member contributions and group output but are less satisfied with software-supported, decision-making processes. The study suggests that group ware is a powerful communication tool for support of work groups but that it may not, in itself, solve the basic problems of getting people to work together effectively and productively."
A User-Oriented Focus to Evaluating Accountants' Writing Skills,"Anthony H. Catanach, Jr, Steven Golen","Accounting educators recently have focused increased attention on the role of the formal curriculum in developing writing skills. Prior research results may be of limited use in curriculum development because these studies rely almost exclusively on the testing of accountants. This article argues that the user of accounting information also is an important party in the communication process. Therefore, the user's input should be considered when evaluating the writing skills of accountants."
Written Language Skills of Entry-Level Accountants as Assessed by Experienced CPAs,"Sandra J. Nelson, Susan Moncada, Douglas C. Smith","Experienced CPAs were surveyed to examine the perception of the written lan guage skills of entry-level accountants. The results suggest that written lan guage fundamentals in word selection and usage, sentence and paragraph construction, and other grammar and mechanics remain a problem for entry- level accountants."
Prejudice and Behavioral Archetypes: A New Model for Cultural-Diversity Training,Lyle Sussman,"Cultural-diversity training programs typically incorporate discussions of why some organizational acts and actors are seen as offensive while others are not. Invariably these discussions elicit perceptions and attributions of the actor's intent and interpersonal style. This paper presents a new model, incorporating intent and style into four archetypes. The archetypes are discussed in detail as are implications for designing and conducting cultural-diversity training."
Addressing Issues of Cultural Diversity in Business Communication,Janice Tovey,"The global business community makes understanding cultural differences importantfor business communication students, ourfuture managers and negotiators. But discussions of cultural diversity or multiculturalism should not be limited to cultures of a foreign country only. They should also include an understanding of the diversity within one culture. This article discusses several terms used to denote cultural diversity and their implications and then provides assignments that give students experience in researching various aspects of ""culture,"" in exploring issues of cultural diversity, and in producing appropriate documents."
A Heuristic for Generating and Organizing the Strategy or Policy Report,"Kathleen Kelly, Natalie Taylor Weaver","We describe a model organization tree for the typical report expected of stu , dents in the strategy or policy course almost universally required in business programs, whether undergraduate or graduate. By defining the relationships between the various analytical tasks and the overall strategy recommendation, the model helps students not only organize the final report but also under stand the process by which they are to arrive at a strategy recommendation."
"Corporate Advisory Boards, Portfolio Assessment, and Business and Technical Writing Program Development",w. Tracy Dillon,This article advocates student learning portfolios as an effective assessment technique and explains how instructors and administrators can devise a process that involves community partners in assessing student performance. Having community experts judge a student portfolio contest helps faculty identify standards for success that can inform decision making about course content and program offerings. The article discusses how to gain and sustain community involvement in program assessment and describes how portfolio assessment led to the creation of a technical and business writing advisory board at an urban university.
Formats for the Citation of Electronic Sources in Business Writing,Mary Ellen Guffey,"Many business researchers today are puzzled when they attempt to construct electronic references to cite sources used in their writing. The most recent edi tions of both the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Associa tion and the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers were published before today's most widely used Internet protocols were introduced: This arti cle presents APA and MLA guides for formatting electronic references. The guides, intended as handouts for students, illustrate typical business communi cation uses."
Integrating Managerial Ethics into the Business Communication Curriculum,"Paula E. Brown, Jean Mausehund","This article addresses the advantages of using a business structure in the classroom, the purpose of discussing ethics in the classroom, a design of a classroom business, the methodology needed to implement the activity, an assessment of outcomes, and the results of the exercise."
"Does ""Gramma-tik"" You off?",Lorraine Ray,The effectiveness of WordPerfect's Grammatik as a tool for business writing is the sub ject of this study. Results of this informal study suggest significant limitations to the effectiveness of this application as a guide for student writ ers. I reached this conclusion by having 12 students' papers critiqued by both Grammatik (affectionately known as Gramma) and by real English/ business communication professors to compare their values.
"Experiential learning, Cases, and Simulations in Business Communication",Peter M. Saunders,"The inclusion of cases and simulations in our curricula may reflect a funda mental paradigm shift in American higher education. Now, colleges must do more than instruct; they must also prove that learning takes place. While the movement toward experiential learning has grown, surprisingly little mention has been made in the literature of the need to ground the use of cases and simulations in experiential learning theory. A basic understanding of the experiential learning process and the nature of cases and simulations as expe riential activities will help instructors of business communication develop, evaluate, and use these tools more effectively."
Intercultural Differences Between Chinese and Americans in Business,"Laura Nowak, D. Dong","As business relationships with China increase, management of multinational enterprises and joint ventures in the U.S. and in China realizes that success depends on attention to cultural differences. This article was written by a Chi nese professor of business communication who benefited from a business internship in San Francisco and an American professor of finance who wit nessed cultural differences in business during a recent exchange visit in Shanghai. The article highlights several cultural differences that promote understanding and reduce the difficulties of dealing with these disparate cul tures. The Chinese point of view of these cultural differences makes this article uniquely valuable."
From Conflict to Harmony: A Heterogeneous Group in a Business Communication Class in Turkey,Ayseli Usluata,This study documents how the literature on group work supports my goals in the business communication classroom and how my experiment with group works proved to be successful. Students were grouped heterogeneously to expe rience the value of working with others and developing intercultural commu nication skills. Student statements and diaries showed that those who were afraid of being exploited or dominated by others in group work discovered the excitement of collaborative learning while exchanging ideas and helping or teaching each other. It was also observed that cultural and demographic differences tended to be eliminated during the interactions.
"""Dressing Down"" in the Business Communication Curriculum",William McPherson,"Corporate America is changing the way it dresses. Students who are preparing for careers in business should be aware of this change, because dress-down days are becoming a part of American corporate culture. Casual dressing is popular, and people-friendly companies are capitalizing on its popularity. This article discusses this corporate trend and offers discussion on the need to include this concept in the business communications curriculum."
An Implementation Model for a Communication Across the Curriculum Program,"Jackie L. Jankovich, Karen Sterkel Powell","In response to the demand for business graduates with good communication skills, many schools are examining ways to enhance and strengthen their com munication programs to ensure students' development of these skills. This paper presents a model for implementing a Communication Across the Cur riculum (CAC) program that is based on an integrated approach to developing students'communication skills. The model is based on the authors'experience as coordinators of the CAC program at their university."
Metacommunication Effects on International Business Negotiating in China,Jeanette W. Gilsdorf,"Forpractitioners and teachers, this article reviews the literature on differences in cultural assumptions underlying negotiation between businesspersons in the People's Republic of China and those from the West, particularly the United States. Unless perceived and understood, profound differences in atti tudes, expectations, and unworded messages will frustrate businesspeople's efforts to do business with China, a huge and developing market."
Further Conceptualization of Explanation in Negative Messages,Mohan R. Limaye,"Regarding explanation in negative messages, this article makes two innovative suggestions for presentation in the classroom and in textbooks of business communication: (1) Providing a reasonable explanation is the sender's moral obligation; receiving such explanation is a natural right of the target. (2) Explanation should be consciously generated and presented on two levels: general (macro) and specific (micro). Such presentation has at least two advantages: explanation on the general level ties the message to its wider con text or even with the human condition itself; explanation on the specific level connects it with the target's unique situation."
Multimedia as a Teaching Tool in Business Communication Course Delivery,"David Liu, Linda Beamer",The two authors created a multimedia intercultural business communication program. Multimedia is an effective instructional tool because of its ability to capture the attention of the learner and offer interactivity so the learner con trols the learning process. An appeal is made to the learner's imagination. Two constraints are the computer requirements to operate it and the length of time required to learn a multimedia software design program. The course content is described and the seven steps in developing the multimedia hypertext are detailed. The authors recommend the process with advice about what charac teristics the authors of multimedia programs need to develop.
Personnel Administrators' Preferences for Résumé Content: Ten Years After,"Kevin L. Hutchinson, Diane S. Brefka","With the heavy reliance upon restcmes for securing employment, instructors are called upon both formally and informally to teach résumé design. The pre sent research was conducted in response to the observation that limited empir ical research exists on résumé content. More specifically, the research extends from and compares to a study of a decade ago (Hutchinson, 1984) to detect potential changes in the preferences for résumé content of personnel adminis trators in Fortune 500 organizations. Based upon responses to questionnaires, the present research draws comparisons between the 1984 research and the present survey to enhance the information available to teachers of résumé design."
A Guide to Using Color Effectively in Business Communication,Scott L. Jones,"As colorprinters drop in price, business communicators will have an increas ing ability to use color. Judicious use of color can make documents attractive, professional, and effective. Unfortunately, poorly used color can seriously detractfrom a document. To prevent such problems, this essay introduces busi ness communication instructors to the principles of effectively using color. Among topics discussed are general uses of color, color used with text, spot color, color in oral presentations, and color in résumés."
"Student Attitudes Toward Written, Oral, and E-mail Communication","Patricia A. Merrier, Ruthann Dirks","Business communication students at two midwestern universities were polled on the first day of the 1995 spring term to determine their (1) written com naunication assignment likes Idislikes; (2) oral communication assignment likes/dislikes; (3) experience using e-mail; and (4) attitudes toward written, oral, and e-mail communication. The 144 respondents viewed oral communi cation less positively than they did either written or e-mail communication. Significant differences were found among overall ratings for oral, written, and e-mail communication. In addition, students with prior e-mail experience gave significantly higher ratings to it and to oral communication than did those who had not used e-mail."
Written Feedback on Student Assignments: Another Look,Ros Byrne,"Recent articles in Business Communication Quarterly advocate giving oral feedback on business communication assignments and compare such com mentary to written feedback: Little attention has been paid, however, to computer-assisted feedback. This article describes one way to give such word- processed feedback, describes some advantages of this mode over both hand written and audio comments, and identifies some limitations of this method."
The Efficacy of Several Writing Feedback Systems,Zane K. Quible,"Over the years, a number of systems have been developed or adapted for use in grading the work of students in written business communication courses. Although the ""perfect"" system most likely has not been developed, a number of those currently used fulfill theirgoal of helping students become more profi cientwriters. Some systems undoubtedly fulfill their goal more effectively than others, however. Regardless of which feedback system an instructor uses, he/she needs to be aware of its advantages and disadvantages as well as ways to maximize its effectiveness. This article provides a review of three different systems: written comments, conferences, and peer evaluation."
Cultural Fluency: Results from a UK and Irish Survey,"Collin Randlesome, Andrew Myers","The importance of being fluent in a foreign language has been well docu mented and highlighted in academic texts. So has the importance of being fluent in another culture, a need documented as early as the 1950s. How have organizations in the UK and Ireland responded to these needs?A survey of members of ALECS (Association of Language Excellence Centres) in the UK and language training providers in Ireland assessed the level of language and cultural awareness. The results indicate that the percentage of British and Irish companies carrying out an internal foreign language audit is disturb ingly low. The number of companies wishing to become culturally fluent is even lower. Companies as well as training organizations are thus overlooking a number of opportunities."
The Frequency and Seriousness of Communication Barriers in the Auditor- Client Relationship,"Steven P. Golen, Anthony H. Catanach, JR, Cindy Moeckel","The accounting profession has called for increased attention to communica tion skill development in accounting curricula. Since independent accountants rely extensively on client communications when gathering evidence during external audits, identifying and minimizing communication barriers with clients can improve audit efficiency and effectiveness. This study evaluated client perceptions of the seriousness and frequency of potential communica tion barriers in external audits. Factor analysis revealed both a credibility/background factor and hostility/conflict factor to be the most seri ous barriers. Subjects perceived personality differences, ""know-it-all"" attitude, ""either-or"" thinking, resistance to change, and jumping to conclusions as occurring most frequently."
A Critical Analysis Of USAir's Image Repair Discourse,"William L. Benoit, Anne Czerwinski","Faced with a crisis, what can a business say? Crisis communication literature tends to focars on what to do before and after a crisis and on the kinds of crises corporations face. Less attention is given to the options available within mes sages about a crisis. The theory of image restoration provides a useful key to composing such messages. This article applies the theory to one case study in image repair discourse: USAir's response to media coverage of the crash of one of its aircraft in Pittsburgh in 1994. Introducing such case studies in the classroom helps students to understand the basic tenets of persausion in the highly charged context of repairing a corporate reputation after an attack."
Writing on the Front Line: A Study of Workplace Writing,Mark Mabrito,"Althoteoh researchers have studied extensively the workplace writing of col lege-degreed professionals, less is known about the writing habits of those without such degrees. This study examined the on-the-job writing of one such group—60 front-line supervisors in a Midwest steel manufacturing plant. Responses to a questionnaire, interviews, and an analysis of 246 documents produced information about the frequency, type, purpose, and length of writ ing produced along with the challenges the supervisors faced as writers on the job. This information will help business communications instructors enhance their understanding of writing on the front line."
Teaching Students How to Write to Avoid Legal Liability,Thomas Clark,"Business commmtmication often has significant legal consequences. Students thus need to learn how to avoid legal liability in their writing. Teaching such skills provides a practical and interesting application of key business commu nication principles and encourages students to improve their ability to analyze audiences by looking at the language of business messages ""through the eyes of the prosecution."""
Learning from Business at the 1996 Western Regional Conference,"Michael Hassett, Richard Pompian","This article encourages regional conference organizers to include business practices panels-in keeping with the call of theABC Committee on Business Practices-by describing the Business Practices Panel of the 1996 ABC West ern Regional Conference. Four representatives of Boise area businesses partic ipated on the panel. After describing the process for organizing the panel, the article summarizes the panelists' comments on such topics as cross-cultural communication, the Internet, diversity, channels of communication, messages to employees, messages to the media and other external publics, communica tions training and evaluation, and interviewing."
What Communication Abilities Do Practitioners Need? Evidence from MBA Students,"N. Lamar Reinsch, Jr, Annette N. Shelby","We collected written critical incidents from young business practitioners entering our MBA program, asking each person to describe a work-related communication episode that had challenged him or her and to answer several questions about the episode. Most often, respondents reported face-to-face oral events that required the respondent to function as an advocate or to manage conflict. Both gender and first language correlated with responses, suggesting that persons of different genders and cultures have differing business experi ences or draw differing conclusions from their experiences. On the basis of these results, we call for management communication courses to give sufficient attention to oral communication events that require spontaneity, persuasion, conflict management, and boundary spanning."
An Exploration of Gender Bias in Computer Clip Art,Marilyn A. Dyrud,"A growing body of literature presenting the results of research regarding text book illustrations indicates that visual gender bias is obvious in several acade mic fields, including business communication. To date, however, no study has extended those observations to clip art files in popular computer programs. The current study examines over 14,000 clip art images for gender bias from six different Windows-based programs: WordPerfect Presentations, PowerPoint 4.0, Microsoft Publisher 2.0, Harvard Graphics 3.0, Power Up!, and Corel 3.0, CD-ROM. Tabulations indicate that only 4.54% of total images depict women and that they are typically presented in stereotypical roles, such as secretaries, nurses, teachers. Reasons include a male bias in the computer science field (a 3:1 ratio in programming), apparent gender-based differences in relationships with machines, and a societal gap in traruitioning between old and new media."
Incorporating Performance Reviews into the Business Writing Classroom,Bob Bergland,"Some instructors undervalue or ignore such short assignments as peer cri tiques, progress memos, and practice documents when they calculate final grades, while others over-emphasize these documents, assigning each a critique and grade, which results in more work for them and re-emphasizes the impor tance of the grade to the student. One strategy for fairly assessing these docu ments is to incorporate them in a performance review at the middle and end of the course. Such a review also helps prepare studerus for the evaluation process they will face and use in the workplace."
"An International Course in International Business Writing: Belgium, Finland, the United States","Ulla M. Connor, Kenneth W. Davis, Teun De Rycker, Elisabeth Margaretha Phillips, J. Piet Verckens","Since 1994, a course in international business writing has been taught simul taneously at institutions in Belgium, Finland, and the United States. The course, which grew out of earlier, shorter-term activities involving Belgian and U.S. students, has three components: (a) instruction; (b) a simulation, in which students exchange business documents internationally; and (c) case studies of business people who communicate internationally in writing."
Listening Competency in the Workplace: A Model for Training,Lynn O. Cooper,"Listening is a desirable skill in organizational settings; good listening can improve worker productivity and satisfaction. The challenge facing consul tants is how to train employees to be competent listeners. Although much research in listening has taken place over the last few years, little of that research addresses workplace listening directly and much is based on false assumptions: that listening is a unitary concept, that listening is a cognitive rather than behavioral skill, and that listening is a linear act. In a 10-year study, we developed a model of organizational listening competency that does apply directly to the workplace. It provides a basis for assessing listening abil ity largely through the observations of co-workers. The model emphasizes two effective behaviors: accuracy, that is, confirming the message sent; and sup port, that is, affirming the relationship between the speaker and the listener: This model serves as an effective basis for improving workplace listening, both through fo..."
Enhancing Connections Between Students and Instructors: African-American Students' Use of Computer-Mediated Communication,"Frank W. Griffin, Lillie Anderton-Lewis","The move to incorporate computer-mediated communication (CMC) into the business curriculum is driven by job market demands for information technol ogy skills. Business instructors may discover, however, a pedagogical bonus: more communication with their students outside the classroom. We studied the perceptions and practices of 138 students in business communications at one of the historically black colleges and universities who used e-mail and the Internet to complete assignments. The results indicate that CMC encouraged students to become active learners and to contact instructors. Anecdotal evi dence suggests that e-mail helps African-American students to see instructors as facilitators, though it does not necessarily become a rhetorical ""safe house,"" where students engage in vernacular discourse. Nevertheless, e-mail fosters an informal rhetorical relationship that rewards openness and collaboration among students and instructors within the formal academic setting."
Teaching Business Communication in an Accelerated Program,Patricia A. Lynott,"In 1995, Elmhurst College began developing a new major in Human Services Administration to serve the needs of a burgeoning adult student population. It is an accelerated, interdisciplinary program in which a small cohort of stu dents matriculates as an interdependent group throughout their college work. Students begin the program with a five-week communication module that pre pares them to communicate information, coordinate activities, and make deci sions. The module includes five components: intercultural communication, the process and contexts of communication, relationship development and self- disclosure, group communication and team building, and oral communica tion. These components were selected as the most important topics to be covered in a short time frame. Teachers serve largely as coaches or guides, lead ing students through exercises in active and cooperative learning, especially those exercises that build listening skills, the fundamental skills for all commu nication."
A Focus on Focus Groups,Zane K. Quible,"Focus groups provide users with valuable qualitative data not readily obtained with any other data-collection techniques. First developed for market researchers to determine the present or potential impact of a product or ser vice, focus groups also help administrators and developers gain information about programs, assess the effectiveness of healthcare and family-planning projects, design political campaigns, and evaluate graduate programs and research efforts, among other data-collection tasks. Business communication classes provide an excellent setting for learning about focus groups and putting such a process into practice."
Navigating the Web with a Typology of Corporate Uses,"Elizabeth A. Hoger, James J. Cappel, Mark A. Myerscough","Many business communication teachers are grappling with ways to use the rich potential of the WorldWide Web. A categorization or typology of sites provides students with a tool to explore the Web systematically and attentively. The typology discussed in this article divides corporate sites into five cate gories depending on purpose: marketplace awareness and promotion, cus tomer support, sales, advertising, and electronic information services. Armed with this typology, students analyze sites as examples of business communica tion. Based on this analysis, they develop a collaborative oral presentation."
Designing a Problem-Based Learning Environment for ESL Students in Business Communication,"Roberta Allen, Pam Rooney","As the population of students speaking English as a second language increases, our business communication courses have required changes in both content and pedagogical approach. We have taught writing, speaking, and lis teningfrom a problem-solving perspective for many years and now find its emphasis on critical thinking poses different challenges for the ESL students in our courses. Consequently, we have designed a problem-based course struc ture for an upper-level business communication course that allows both ESL and native English-speaking students the opportunity to improve communica tion abilities in cross-cultural work groups."
Teaching Students to Correspond Effectively Electronically,Marian M. Extejt,"In their business careers, today's students will probably compose and send far more e-mail messages than memos or letters. Students should understand that e-mail messages have a unique place in the communications continuum and, therefore, their own rules. While the format of an e-mail message may resem ble that of a memo, each element presents special requirements in an elec tronic medium. The interactivity of e-mail offers both opportunities and constraints to writers and readers. A special etiquette also applies to e-mail, especially the need to avoid flaming and spamming and to check e-mail often. While writers often think their office e-mail is private, employers who own the systems have been upheld legally in their right to monitor e-mail for business reasons, and thus students should pay careful attention to the content and tone of their messages. Assigning e-mail projects in class helps students prepare for this important communications medium, work effectively in teams, and corre spond with corpor..."
Student Perceptions About Business Communication in Their Careers,Bill McPherson,There is little question among educators and business executives that excellent communication skills are requisites for today's jobs. Yet most business teachers realize the difficulty of getting students to take business communication courses seriously. Succcessful teachers know that students learn best when they value what they are learning as relevant. Teachers can often create learning environments that stimulate students' enthusiasm for learning if they can relate topics taught in school to career or life goals of students. This study was conducted to assist students in becoming more aware of business communica tion tasks they will be expected to complete when they enter the business world. The goal is to provide information to help create a learning environ ment where the significance of communication is recognized and appreciated. The study sought to answer this question: What are students' perceptions con cerning their future business communication tasks?
Meeting Technology: From Low-Tech to High-Tech,Mary Munter,"This article describes a series of low-tech and high-tech options for use in meeting management and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each. These options include (1) face-to-face meetings, with choices of flipcharts, non-electronic boards, electronic boards, handouts, still projectors, and multimedia projectors; and (2) groupware meetings, with choices of audio- and videoteleconferencing, e-mail meetings, and electronic meetings."
Community Service Learning Increases Communication Skills Across the Business Curriculum,"Mary L. Tucker, Anne M. McCarthy, John A. Hoxmeier, Margarita M. Lenk","Community service learning offers a unique and rewarding way for business students to reinforce communication capabilities while developing lifelong career and social skills. This article defines community service learning, dis cusses its importance to business as well as higher education, and describes three community service learning projects. Students in these projects taught elementary students, designed a computer system for a community nonprofit, and developed accounting systems for university divisions. In doing so, they enhanced their understanding of classroom theories and communication skills through service-learning."
How Fortune 500 Companies Are Using Electronic Résumé Management Systems,"William H. Baker, Kristen DeTienne, Karl L. Smart","Scanning technology is now playing a major role in Human Resource Infor mation Systems (HRIS). As new applications are received, many organiza tions scan the résumés into their databases and subsequently search key words to achieve a match between applicants' qualifications and job requirements. But typographical embellishments on some résumés cause scanning difficul ties. This research article reports the impact of electronic résumé-management systems in Fortune 500 companies and examines the implications of this technology, providing guidelines for producing scanner-friendly résumés."
Innovative Pedagogy: Academic Service-Learning for Business Communication,Jean L. Bush-Bacelis,"Academic Service-Learning (AS-L) is an innovative business communication pedagogy. Like community service, AS-L involves students volunteering in the community; however, AS-L requires the infusion of the classroom content into the community service experience. This article describes AS-L, the assignment for a business communication class, and students' reactions as well as benefits and challenges to its use. The greatest strength of using AS-L is students'tying theory into actual application of principles, student passion for the work, fac ulty enthusiasm for the results, and community satisfaction."
Using Team Learning in Business and Organizational Communication Classes,Deborah Britt Roebuck,"The past decade has produced a growing body of evidence suggesting small group-based instructional methods can promote the achievement of a variety of desirable higher educational outcomes. Therefore, within college and uni versity settings, group-oriented instruction has increased. Team Learning goes beyond using temporary groups or assigning occasional group activities. With this approach, students spend approximately 80 percent of their in-class time working in permanent and heterogeneous teams. The system, when used prop erly, appears to overcome many of the potential problems with using small groups. The methodology empowers both instructor and students. The instruc tor becomes a facilitator and manager of learning rather than the ""spoon feeder"" of information. The students become active and responsible partici pants in the learning process rather than passive recipients. The process facili tates effective teamwork in settings where teams gain first-hand experience with the kind of team dynamics they..."
Dear ???: Understanding British Forms of Address,James Calvert Scott,"Since Britons historically have placed a high value on the use of correct fortns of address, those who write to and speak with them should be familiar with their generally accepted address-related customs. In relatively formal commu nication settings, the use of titles and surnames is generally sanctioned, although there are some notable exceptions. In relatively informal communi cation settings, the use of first names or appropriate substitute expressions is generally sanctioned. Business communication teachers can incorporate infor mation about British forms of address into both general business communica tion and specialized international business communication courses as the provided examples suggest."
Contexting Koreans: Does the High/Low Model Work?,Jane Thomas,"South Korea is assumed to be a high-context culture with extensive shared information and an emphasis on relationships in doing business. The follow ing study reported here tests this assumption and illustrates similarities and differences between Korean and American writers in an attempt to document language differences between high- and low- context societies. Data in the texts studied did not confirm the high/low contextfeatures expected. South Korean texts showed more similarities to than differences from the American texts, and the language features found suggest a more complex context situa tion than the high/low context model may be able to accommodate."
Analyzing International Letters in a Business Communication Class,Bonnie Devet,"In the global marketplace, professionals need to understand how cultural differences affect the writing and reading of business letters. Business commu nication courses can prepare students to meet this need by teaching students an effective, systematic method for analyzing the letters of the global economy. The method incorporates such characteristics as format, organization, rhetori cal strategies (ethos, pathos, logos), style, and writer's purpose. Through case studies in letter writing and analysis, students apply key communication prin ciples in an international context."
Multimedia Copyright Laws and Guidelines: Take the Test,"Joseph V. Arn, Rebecca Gatlin, William Kordsmeier","Increasing numbers of Association for Business Communication members are using multimedia as a form of instruction. Because copyright guidelines affecting multimedia production have only recently been established, policies are not well known. To determine if ABC members understand the guidelines, we created a questionnaire about specific instances of multimedia use and sent it via Internet e-mail to a sample chosen from the 1996 membership directory. Respondents received an average grade of ""C,"" with most answering conservatively, assuming that copyright restrictions are more restrictive than they, in fact, are."
Teaching Students to Enhance the Ecology of Small Group Meetings,Thomas Clark,"Students need to understand how the interplay of ideas, personalities, and environment-the ecology-of a meeting contributes to productivity and satis faction in group process. Only when the ecology is right can the meeting work. To address that ecology explicitly, instructors should help students assess their prior experience in small groups. In a classroom exercise, student teams answer one of a set of questions about meetings: 1. How participants know when a meeting is productive (or not); 2. How they know when warm hospi tality has been extended (or not); 3. What happens before, during, and after meetings that generates broad enthusiasm—or produces apathy. A class period spent on such discussion helps convince students of the need to proactively apply effective meeting management principles in their own workplace. Key words: Group process, meetings, participation, hospitality, enthusiasm"
Group Work and Electronic Meeting Systems: From Boardroom to Classroom,"William L. Tullar, Paula R. Kaiser, Pierre A. Balthazard","In the business community, collaborative efforts of work teams have led to a dramatic increase in the number of group meetings. Business managers, seek ing more efficient and effective methods of managing diverse contributions, have increasingly used information technology to supportgroup work. The same need to improve group communication is relevant to today's classroom, where new technologies can transform the classroom from a traditional instructor-centered environment to a student-centered environment where stu dents actively participate in intellectual discourse. Results from field and labo ratory studies about business usage of electronic meeting systems (EMS) can be applied to the classroom setting. We offer an overview of available tools and suggest some classroom activities. EMS-supported courses provide many new opportunities to foster learning. Students participate, participate more equally, and report a highly satisfying experience."
How MBA Programs Are Using the GMAT's Analytical Writing Assessment,"Cheryl L. Noll, Robert H. Stowers","The Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) was designed to serve two purposes: assess appli cants' ability to think critically and communicate complex ideas and aid MBA programs in diagnosing any deficiencies in accepted candidates in order to place them in appropriate classes. To determine how programs are using the AWA scores, we surveyed the 121 member schools of the Graduate Manage ment Council. Eighty-six percent of the fifty-nine respondents indicated that they do indeed use the scores to refine their admissions decisions, but only a few schools use the test diagnostically in making such other decisions as plac ing students in writing development courses, waving communication require ments, or granting assistantships."
Student Portfolios: A Tool to Enhance the Traditional Job Search,"Karen Sterkel Powell, Jackie L. Jankovich","Student portfolios are a tool that academic institutions can implement to enhance students' job search processes. Students can enhance their ability to pass the initial screening process by preparing a portfolio that identifies their goals and provides evidence that they possess the skills and qualities to reach these goals. The portfolio should emphasize communication skills, as they are deemed most important by employers in the initial screening process. When preparing a portfolio, students should consider a variety of media, including paper, videotape, and compact disk. Schools that implement student portfolios must decide if all students will be required to prepare them, if the administra tors will determine the contents, and who will approve the contents of stu dents' portfolios."
Assessing Competency in Business Writing,"Iris I. Varner, Paula J. Pomerenke","Assessing the level of improvement of students' writing competency during a semester is becoming increasingly important for business communication instructors. When conducting an assessment, instructors need to be aware of issues that will affect reliability and validity. They need to develop cleargoals at the beginning; for example, good assessment strives to improve instruction and to develop students' communication skills. Because different schools have different missions and operate in different environments, a custom-made instrument will ensure that the assessment fits the local conditions. Before con ducting the assessment, the instrument needs to be validated for specific use, and scorers must be trained in holistic scoring to reach an overall assessment."
Advising Graduate Students for Successful International Internships,William B. Chapel,"An increasing number of faculty advise graduate students prior to and during internship assignments abroad. To be effective in this important task, the advi sor needs to understand the cultural dimensions of work and of internships in particular. The faculty advisor is pivotal to the success of any internship—par ticularly in international settings—and must understand how an interna tional context affects the selection, training, and monitoring of interns and the evaluation of the internships"
Introduction: Are We Requiring What Our Students Most Need?,Michael A. Netzley,"Why devote a special issue to the topic of writing requirements for business stu dents? The answer, I believe, is relatively simple: any such requirement must reflect what business professionals should know and do in a knowledge economy. Because communication practices are changing radically, our requirements, too, must be reexamined. This issue provides a forum for such reexamination."
"Writing and Other Communication Standards in Undergraduate Business Education: A Study of Current Program Requirements, Practices, and Trends",Melinda Knight,"A survey of 52 top-ranked undergraduate business schools suggests that profi ciency in written and oral communication is considered an important requirement for an undergraduate business degree. This conclusion derives from a study of offi cial Web sites, with follow-up verification by e-mail. All schools have writing and other communication (primarily oral) standnrds in place; 50 have lower-division writing requirements, and 17 schools have other lower-division communication requirements (primarily oral). A total of 36 schools have upper-division writing requirements, and 25 of those schools offer business communication courses through the business schools, and not through liberal arts divisions."
Teaching Field-specific Writing: Results of a WAC Survey,Molly Hill Epstein,"In a recent survey, faculty in the College of Business Administration at Georgia State University recorded their perceptions of the effectiveness of both undergradu ate and graduate student writing. In general, respondents found students were able to design and present their documents well and to analyze and build common ground with the reader. They were less able to select and organize material, pres ent a plan of action, and express their message clearly. In further comments and follow-up discussions, respondents expressed frustration with their lack of time in class to teach both their areas of expertise and effective writing skills.""Evaluating written assignments is time consuming, labor-intensive work, and our new faculty work load policy will not encourage the use of written assignments. """"Writing is a skill that can be taught and we should be doing it. Unfortunately the move to larger class sizes is a disincentive for faculty to assign more written work."""
Case Method Instruction in the Business Writing Classroom,Elizabeth M. Dorn,An effective pedagogy narrows or closes the gap between what is taught in pre- professional communications programs and what is expected on the job. Case studies are often an important element in such pedagogy. But an analysis of cases recently published in Business Communication Quarterly and a survey of 25 employees who consider writing important to successful performance at work show that we may be giving our students instruction they will rarely use. The BCQ cases typically require students to respond to exceptional rhetorical situations when in reality the rhetorical situations writers usually face require more mundane and standardized types of discourse.
Trends in Business Curricula: The View from AACSB,Cathy Ryan,"Note: This commentary reflects a phone conversation with Charles Hickman, Director of Products and Special Services, AACSB (The International Associa tion for Management Education—formerly American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business) on 16 November 1998. Our conversation ranged over sev eral topics pertinent to communications requirements in AACSB schools. We are grateful to Mr. Hickman for allowing us to summarize his views in this issue."
Writing Apprehension in Beginning Accounting Majors,"Kay A. Faris, steven P. Golen, David H. Lynch","With writing skills receiving increased emphasis in the accounting curriculum, edu cators need to explore the potential barriers to writing that students may experience. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether accounting majors have higher levels of writing apprehension than students in other majors. Also stud ied was whether gender, age, and grades in Freshman Composition were related to the level of writing anxiety. A sample of students responded to items on the Writing Apprehension Test to measure their writing apprehension. The students also identi fied their gender, age, major, and grades in Freshman Composition.Significant differences do exist in level of writing apprehension based on grades in Freshman Composition but not based on a student's age or gender choice. Most important, accounting majors did show significantly greater appre hension than non-accounting majors."
Connecting Accounting and Communication: A Survey of Public Accounting Firms,"Robert H. Stowers, G.Thomas White","Communication skills are valued highly in public accounting firms, where profes sionals at all levels communicate as part of their jobs. However, respondents to a 1997 survey reported that the development of effective communication skills was not part of formal accounting education and that partners and managers want their entry-level professionals to have these skills at the onset. Further, these skills increase in importance as accounting professionals progress from entry-level to manager to partner. Educational institutions need to develop programs that include communication topics and courses to prepare accountants for the challenges of their profession."
Using Practitioners' Viewpoints to Improve Accounting Students' Communications Skills,"Donald A. Nellermoe, Thomas R. Weirich, Alan Reinstein","The accounting profession has recognized the importance of emphasizing written and oral communications skills in the accounting curriculum. Innovations in tech nology have greatly enhanced educators' abilities to incorporate instruction in such skills. A survey of practitioners indicates strong agreement with the new writing requirements of the CPA exam. In addition, they endorse the use of information technology in preparing documents based on specific models and prescribed criteria."
Using Total Quality Principles in Business Courses: the Effect on Student Evaluations,Janet Barnard,"Total Quality Management (TQM) is an approach that encourages employees at all levels of an organization to make suggestions about how work should be done and to take an active role in improving processes. Although business organizations have applied TQM principles with considerable success, its use in higher education has been largely limited to administrative processes. Many teaching faculty in schools of business are uncomfortable with applying TQM principles to the class room, often because the idea of empowering students requires thinking differently about their potential for participation in planning processes for the learning envi ronment. Yet a survey of students and faculty suggests that a TQM approach can increase students' learning in a class, help students support one another in a coop erative learning environment, and foster positive feelings toward the instructor, even one who maintains the necessary high standards."
Developing a Competency-based Fundamentals of Management Communication Course,"Patricia A. Murranka, David Lynch","An innovative course in fundamentals of management communication derives from competency-based instruction. Course designers created a list of competen cies and behavioral objectives for each of four modules: business writing funda mentals, formal report writing, informative oral presentations, and persuasive oral presentations. Students receive the list before instructions. Students also gain instruction in class or through self-study or both. They are assessed through multi ple forms of assessment, and those assessments are measured in relation to individ ual demonstration of competencies rather than course norms. In general, the stu dents, faculty, and administration have viewed this course positively."
Bringing Outdoor Challenge Education Inside the Business Communication Classroom,"Debbie D. DuFrene, William Sharbrough, Tim Clipson, Miles McCall","Outdoor challenge education has gained a dedicated following since its inception in the 1940s. Outdoor programs provide a framework for organizations to improve teamwork, problem solving, risk-taking, self-esteem, and interpersonal communi cation. The advantages of outdoor-based programs include high participation in learning by trainees, opportunity to experience real emotions and adopt new pat terns of thinking, ability to promote experimentation in problem solving, and pro motion of group awareness and trust. Many advantages of outdoor education can be maintained when a program goes indoors. Indoor adaptations are safe and nondiscriminatory; they can be conducted anywhere regardless of weather, can facilitate easier transfer of learning to the workplace, and are less expensive. Using the outdoor model, teachers can devise challenge activities for classroom use. Such activities provide variety and the opportunity for experiential learning in the busi ness communication classroom."
Empirically Based Guidelines for Developing Teaching Materials on the Web,"Corinne M. Karuppan, Muthu Karuppan","A recent study showed that Web-based materials enhanced teaching and learning in an introductory operations management course. Evidence gained from the study provides the basis for several guidelines concerning the early stages of implementing such a course. Faculty should understand why students visit the Website, time the availability of materials to match usage patterns, and provide information in appropriate detail and in an appropriate format. The Website facilitated students' note taking and studying, enhanced class discussion, and aided retention; it did not encourage students to miss class, as some faculty feared. Students tended to print out materials from the site, so that printing costs for courses were not reduced, just transferred from an academic department to the computer lab or the students. While traditional ""chalk and talk"" approaches will continue in the short term, students will increasingly see such an approach as outdated and find the Web their instructional medium of choice."
Correlating Students' Personality Types with Their Rating of Topics Covered in Business Communication Classes,Bill McPherson,"For years, students, faculty, and, most important, employers, have recognized the need for improved communication skills. The university business communication curriculum is filled with topics that lead to improving communication skills. A per centage of students find some topics to be boring, unimportant, intimidating, and/or nonessential. However, other students find these same topics to be interest ing, significant, challenging, and vital. For example, college students fear giving oral presentations more than writing papers. Could the preference or the abhor rence of various business communication topics be related to personality type? To answer this question, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), combined with a Likert Scale, was used to study the relationship between business communication students' personality types and their preferred topics in business communication."
Guiding Students in Finding information on the Web,Zane K. Quible,"Searching for information on the Web can be a daunting, frustrating, mind-bog gling, and sometimes-futile activity. To increase the odds of finding the right infor mation, one needs to understand the operation of four search tools: Web directo ries, search engines, indexes, and spiders or robots. Understanding Boolean logic also helps. Business communication instructors can aid students in their research by introducing them to the terminology and functions of an efficient Web search process."
Exploring How Instruction in Style Affects Writing Quality,"Kim Sydow Campbell, Charlotte Brammer, Nicole Ervin","Business communication instructors regularly teach word- and sentence-level style concepts to help students improve the quality of their writing. To support such teaching, all the textbooks we've seen discuss style at this level, usually in a chap ter on the topic, with additional discussion within other chapters dedicated to spe cific types of messages. We are hopeful but not certain about the impact of this instruction on the quality of our students' future writing. To measure that impact in at least a small way, we gathered empirical data in a single classroom of busi ness communication students. A panel of three writing specialists and three non- specialists rated holistically the quality of informative memos written by undergrad uate business students before and after instruction. In addition, three panelists analyzed the style of the memos. The memos written after instruction were of higher quality than those written before instruction. The students' styles changed for the better after instruction; ..."
Computer-Aided Peer Review of Writing,Laura MacLeod,"Classes that require writing assignments commonly engage students in some form of peer review. Such reviews can profit from two computer applications: news groups and specialized communication client software. In a recent survey, a majority of the students who conducted peer reviews in a business writing class found the activities useful and worthy of repeating in future semesters. But they suggested that faculty provide more guidelines and topics to enhance the substance of the review, train students more directly in the computer applications, and allot more time to conduct the reviews at a comfortable pace."
Management Communication in US MBA Programs: The State of the Art,Melinda Knight,"A study of 32 top-ranked MBA programs suggests that management communica tion is an important part of professional graduate management education. Eigh teen of the schools have required core courses in communication, and two other schools follow an integrated model and also offer electives; another nine offer elec tives only. A total of four schools also have writing proficiency requirements, and all four of those schools have core communication courses as well. Only three schools in the sample do not have any communication course offerings. These results are based on an analysis of official Websites and follow-up contact by e- mail or personal interview."
Content of the Business Communication Course: An Analysis of Coverage,"William J. Wardrope, Marsha L. Bayless","This study examined 229 responses from members of the Association for Business Communication (United States) who rated the importance of 30 business commu nication concepts. The concepts were divided into six categories: communication theory, written communication, oral communication, employment communica tion, technology, and current business communication issues. Respondents also reported the amount of class coverage they provided for each topic. Of the 30 con cepts, 23 were rated as moderately or greatly important. Gaps occurred in some categories between their perceived importance and their actual class coverage. The five most important concepts centered on written communication and were ranked as follows (from highest to lowest ): Use correct grammar and sentence structure, write memoranda, write persuasive news, write good news/positive message let ters, and write reports."
Auditors' Communication Requirements: A Study of Five MNCs in Singapore,"Valerie Priscilla Goby, Justus Helen Lewis","This article contributes to the research on preparing new auditors for their work. It investigates the work and communication needs of newly graduated auditors, their senior colleagues, and their managers in five MNCs (multinational companies ) in Sin gapore. Much research indicates that accountancy graduates entering the profession are perceived to be lacking some important communication abilities. This study investigates how important auditors perceive interpersonal, oral, and written skills to be to them at different stages of their professional careers and the degree to which they perceive that they need to improve in these skills. As expected, the newly graduated audit assistants perceived the greatest need for improvement in all three skills. However, they also per ceived that written skills were of lesser importance to them than interpersonal and oral skills. We suggest that accounting courses could prepare undergraduates more effectively in the oral/interpersonal skills needed in the initial stage..."
Using Communication Audits to Teach Organizational Communication to Students and Employees,"Craig R. Scott, Sandra Pride Shaw, C. Erik Timmerman, Volker Frank, Laura Quinn","Communication audits serve well as educational tools for both student auditors and employees of organizations. To use audits, teachers need to gain access to organizations, especially through internal audit departments; negotiate the exchange of essentially free audit findings for a learning experience and research data; and secure commitment from top management, other organizational mem bers, and student auditors. To administer the audit itself, teachers should start with a pilot audit followed by full assessment, conduct a two-phase process of data collection and analysis that includes questionnaires and interviews, and report findings in a timely and effective manner. The promises of the approach outweigh its inevitable perils."
Text(ing) in Context,Thomas J. Kiddie,"Following Rogers’s theory of the diffusion of innovations, the author questions whether youth entering the workforce will act as change agents to evolve primary business communication channels from email to text-messaging. Expanding on research performed in 2009, the author investigates three communication scenarios: scheduling meetings, exchanging information in the workplace, and keeping in contact with family and friends. Follow-up research also gathers information about communication hardware trends. The author concludes that change agents and early adopters already in the company, not new hires, will effect a change in communication media that will involve new technology such as smartphones."
Task Design and Interaction in Collaborative Writing,"Stephen Bremner, Anne Peirson-Smith, Rodney Jones, Vijay Bhatia","This article investigates student behaviour on collaborative assignments, looking at the relationship between task type and interaction, and considers the implications for task design. Students reported on interactions in a year-long workplace-focussed group communication project, comparing these with interactions on other academy-based group assignments. Differences were seen in the amount of brainstorming, the criteria for dividing up work, the intensity of editing, and how conflict was managed. Contributing factors to these differences included the presence or absence of a creative element, the instrumental nature of the task, and the need for a collective approach inherent in the task design."
Multitasking With Smartphones in the College Classroom,"Anne Bradstreet Grinols, Rishi Rajesh","Although the concept of multitasking itself is under debate, smartphones do enable users to divert attention from the task at hand to nongermane matters. As smartphone use becomes pervasive, extending into our classrooms, educators are concerned that they are becoming a major distraction. Does multitasking with smartphones impede learning? Can they be used to enhance learning instead? This article reviews current literature, provides suggestions for further investigation, and proposes an approach to incorporate smartphone multitasking in the classroom to enhance learning."
Serious Games,Anne E. Witte,"One business school addressed the “zeitgeist” of the financial crisis by introducing in its inaugural seminar the cultural and ethical values too often absent from the types of transactions students are trained to manage. Drawing from cross-cultural and communication studies, the author tested “serious games”—cultural situations and personal development exercises aimed at rewarding rule-based cooperation, interpersonal communication, and cultural empathy. Observations made during the games fostered curriculum reform by integrating humanistic concerns considered vital for international finance careers. Linking such training to business learning objectives enhances accountability, rule-based action, and cultural awareness reform."
Social Media—A Virtual Pandora’s Box,"Susan Evans Jennings, Justin R. Blount, M. Gail Weatherly","With the increase in the use of mobile devices in the workplace, both employer supplied and personally owned, and the major role social media has begun to play in today’s world, businesses face many new challenges with their employees. Social media may be seen by some employers as a virtual Pandora’s Box. Though it may seem to hold bountiful riches, employee posts can unleash a firestorm of unforeseen challenges and consequences ranging from financial, to legal, to ethical. In looking at business use of social media, this article will discuss the prevalence of social media use, possible legal liabilities thereof, and policies to consider."
Crossing Public-Private and Personal-Professional Boundaries,Daphne A. Jameson,"When Chiquita Brands considered relocating its corporate headquarters, competing cities started Twitter campaigns to influence the decision by communicating directly with the chief executive officer. As he used the new microblogging channel, some of his previously private communication became public, some personal communication became professional, and some professional communication became personal. The case shows how social media can significantly affect chief executive officers’ communication by encouraging boundary crossing. Understanding the connections between the private versus public and personal versus professional rhetorical categories will help business communicators make wise choices as technology continues to introduce new social media and other channel options."
Student and Faculty Perspectives on Motivation to Collaborate in a Service-Learning Course,"Rebecca Pope-Ruark, Paige Ransbury, Mia Brady, Rachel Fishman","This case study, an example of scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) research, explores student motivations to collaborate with both peer teams and community partners in a service-learning course. Written by one instructor and three undergraduates, the article draws on personal narratives, student reflections, and a postcourse student survey. Our experiences and findings suggest that in courses like these positive extrinsic factors motivate students to collaborate in ways that the extrinsic motivators in typical assignments do not, helping to foster trust and shared goals. We also share our work as an example of how to include student voices in SoTL work."
Negotiating Diversity,"Shujie Guo, Cheryl Cockburn-Wootten, Debashish Munshi","The intercultural divides in values, perceptions, and interpretations of concepts have been studied extensively by international business and intercultural communication scholars. Consequentially, much effort in university classrooms is spent on focusing on the differences between groups and on finding ways to “manage” cultural diversity. What is often missed is the common ground among cultural groups and the differences within what are presumed to be homogenous groups of students. To negotiate this complexity of diversity, we describe an initiative to foster collaborative student-led analyses of a case study to open up meaningful discussions around diversity."
"Selections From the ABC 2013 Annual Convention, New Orleans, Louisiana",D. Joel Whalen,"This article, the first of a two-part series, catalogs teaching innovations presented at the 2013 Association for Business Communication (ABC) Annual Convention, New Orleans. They were presented during the My Favorite Assignment session. The 11 Favorite Assignments featured here offer the reader a variety of learning experiences including collaborative team work, debate, budgets, cross-cultural communication, report writing, persuasion, nonprofit organizations, client communication, and writing funding proposals.

Expanding Omani Learners’ Horizons Through Project-Based Learning,Victoria Dauletova,"As a relatively innovative teaching/learning approach in the Arabian Gulf region, in general, and in Oman, in particular, project-based learning requires progressive amendments and adaptations to the national culture of the learner. This article offers analysis of the current state of the approach in the local educational environment. Furthermore, it introduces the challenges of applying this unconventional type of instruction to Omani learners together with their response to the new learning conditions and philosophy. It also offers ideas on adaptations and implementation of project-based learning within the Arabian Gulf undergraduate student community."
"Selections From the ABC 2013 Annual Convention, New Orleans, Louisiana",D. Joel Whalen,"This article, the second in a two-part series, catalogs teaching innovations presented at the 2013 Association for Business Communication Annual Convention, New Orleans. They were presented during the My Favorite Assignment session. The 11 Favorite Assignments featured here offer the reader a variety of learning experiences, including collaborative teamwork, debate, budgets, cross-cultural communication, report writing, persuasion, not-for-profit organization, client communication, and writing funding proposals.

Using Oral Exams to Assess Communication Skills in Business Courses,Lisa A. Burke-Smalley,"Business, like many other fields in higher education, continues to rely largely on conventional testing methods for assessing student learning. In the current article, another evaluation approach—the oral exam—is examined as a means for building and evaluating the professional communication and oral dialogue skills needed and utilized by business graduates. Prior studies of oral exams in higher education are reviewed, along with the empirical findings from an exploratory investigation of an oral exam in an undergraduate human resource course. Implications for future research and the use of oral exams in business education are also presented."
The Impromptu Gauntlet,Robert N. Yale,"Typical business communication courses provide significantly more opportunities for students to hone their skills in writing compared with speaking. This article outlines an impromptu speech assignment and explains a course-level strategy for providing each student with more than 30 significant speaking opportunities during a term. This approach has proven to be surprisingly popular as students observe a remarkable transformation in their confidence and competence with presentational speaking. Teaching strategies, assignment guidelines, results, and additional resources are presented."
Cultivating Critical-Thinking Dispositions Throughout the Business Curriculum,"Janel Bloch, Sandra E. Spataro","Critical thinking is an essential component of managerial literacy, yet business school graduates struggle to apply critical-thinking skills at work to the level that employers desire. This article argues for a dispositional approach to teaching critical thinking, rooted in cultivating a critical-thinking culture. We suggest a two-pronged approach of (a) clearly defining critical thinking and selecting an accessible model for applying it and (b) integrating critical thinking consistently throughout the business curriculum. We illustrate implementation of this strategy in our revised MBA curriculum and conclude by challenging others to consider adopting a cultural and dispositional approach."
The State of Business Communication Classes,"Farrokh Moshiri, Peter Cardon","This nationwide study of 169 business communication instructors examines the following issues: (a) ideal and actual class sizes in business communication courses, (b) delivery modes of business communication courses, (c) types of written and oral assignments, and (d) topics covered and depth of coverage. Findings suggest that business communication course offerings are growing on the national stage. The vast majority of class sizes have stayed the same or gotten smaller. One significant change over the past 5 years is the increased focus on interpersonal communication and teamwork. While some courses offer significant coverage of social media, the majority does not."
Termination Documentation,"Mike Duncan, Jillian Hill","In this study, we examined 11 workplaces to determine how they handle termination documentation, an empirically unexplored area in technical communication and rhetoric. We found that the use of termination documentation is context dependent while following a basic pattern of infraction, investigation, intervention, and termination. Furthermore, the primary audience of the documentation is typically legal and regulatory bodies, not the employee. We also make observations about genre, collaboration, and authorship in these documents."
Mythologizing Change,Jacob D. Rawlins,"This article explores how rhetorical myth can be used as a tool for persuading employees to accept change and to maintain consensus during the process. It defines rhetorical myth using three concepts: chronographia (a rhetorical interpretation of history), epideictic prediction (defining a present action by assigning praise and blame to both past and future), and communal markers (using Burkean identification and rhetorically defined boundary objects to define a community). The article reports on a 3-year ethnographic study that documents the development of a rhetorical myth at Iowa State University’s Printing Services department as it underwent changes to its central software system."
Examining U.S. and Spanish Annual Reports,"Juan C. Palmer-Silveira, Miguel F. Ruiz-Garrido","Crisis has affected businesses worldwide. Many international corporations must cope with this turmoil, which affects their economic liability. Firms express their actual financial situation in the annual reports they issue every year. The annual report is a document that combines both promotional and informative features. Our study tries to find out how companies from two different countries (United States and Spain) deal with the issue of crisis in difficult times through their annual report. Additionally, and from a pedagogical perspective, we discuss the benefits of using the annual report in the teaching of writing for our students."
Social Media Use to Enhance Internal Communication,"Amy M. Young, Mary D. Hinesly","Organizations are increasingly using social media to improve their internal communication. When successfully implemented, such initiatives can have a dramatic impact on internal efficiency, team collaboration, innovation, organizational alignment, and cultural transformation. This article describes a course offered by the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, on the use of social media for internal business communication that can be modified for Bachelor of Business Administration or Master of Business Administration students. The authors describe the pedagogy behind the course design, provide a course description, and discuss social media/communication consulting projects conducted in the class."
Navigating Change,"Debbie D. DuFrene, Carol M. Lehman","Employees often perceive periods of change—no matter how warranted or beneficial—as crises, exhibiting both cognitive and emotional reactions including feelings of insecurity and uncertainty, even fear, chaos, stress, betrayal, grief, and anger. Management must have a clear strategy for communicating with employees through change, as employee expectations for open and honest communication are increased in times of shift and uncertainty. Open, honest, and regular communication is essential to keeping employees motivated and productive. Benefits of effective communication in times of change include higher employee satisfaction and engagement, lower turnover, and stronger long-term commitment. Solid internal relationships also strengthen ethics-related outcomes such as fraud reduction and reputation management."
“Going Mobile” in Business Communication at an Arabian Gulf University,"Chrysi Rapanta, Catherine Nickerson, Valerie Priscilla Goby","In this article, we describe a project in which undergraduate business seniors at a university in the Arabian Gulf created or evaluated the chapters of an iBook as part of their final course in business communication. Students were surveyed throughout the project, and they also participated in a focus group discussion at the end. The aim was to evaluate their experience with learning from a peer-generated iBook and to identify any motivating factors behind it. The study showed that incorporating mobile learning into the business communication classroom was highly meaningful for the students involved for a range of different reasons."
Communicative Needs in the Workplace and Curriculum Development of Business English Courses in Hong Kong,Mable Chan,"The pressing need to bridge the gap between workplace communicative needs and curriculum development of business English courses has been documented in the literature. Through a questionnaire survey of 215 working adults, this study examines (a) the spoken and written needs of professionals in the local Hong Kong workplace, (b) the challenges they meet, (c) what they perceive as the most difficult spoken and written communication means, and (d) professionals’ concerns about the course content to make such courses effective. This article provides insights into what constitutes an effective business English course and facilitates the teaching and learning of business English."
Communicating Organizational Change Reactions,Helle Kryger Aggerholm,"The aim of this article is to study employees’ discursive construction of disparate survivor responses. The analysis reveals how employees position themselves simultaneously within different types of categories by use of discursive actions. Drawing on various discourses, the actors reject having one solid core of identity and instead signal the existence of various flexible identities. The article contributes to a greater understanding of the importance of discourse within organizational change. An increased managerial sensitivity toward employee discourse may help to understand why employees obstruct organizational changes and subsequently make it easier to preempt and handle such reactions."
Responding to Hostility,"Kim Sydow Campbell, Pierson Carmichael, Jefrey S. Naidoo","Hostile challenges to planned organization change are common and challenging to deal with effectively. Little research has explained successful responses to such stakeholder hostility. To address this gap, we use the concept of readiness to characterize the content of hostile challenges. We also use rhetorical strategies based on speech act theory to describe options for responding to those challenges. Because change agents must choose among multiple strategies, we continue a line of research investigating relative preferences among them. Ultimately, our aim is to offer six lessons for change agents who face hostile challenges based on evidence from research."
Instituting Cultural Change at a Major Organization,Ronald E. Dulek,"This article examines the development and implementation of a strategic cultural change program from a case study perspective. Initially, the article describes how the program was developed, including an explanation as to how a communication component was integrated into the program from inception. This integration helped reduce the anxiety that change programs traditionally initiate. Additionally, the article examines preliminary findings captured during the program’s implementation. These findings provide generalized insights about ways communication, strategy, and cultural change programs interact. As such, the findings provide real-world support that communication facilitates organizational change."
Investigating Factors Affecting Group Processes in Virtual Learning Environments,"Sunil Hazari, Sandra Thompson","With the widespread popularity of distance learning, there is a need to investigate elements of online courses that continue to pose significant challenges for educators. One of the challenges relates to creating and managing group projects. This study investigated business students’ perceptions of group work in online classes. The constructs of learning and social interaction, process satisfaction, product satisfaction, and use of technology in the virtual learning environment were investigated. The use of social media networks by group participants was also examined. Recommendations are provided for business educators looking to develop or enhance teamwork in virtual learning environments."
The Role of Motivational Values in the Construction of Change Messages,"Peter W. Cardon, Marion Philadelphia","We examined how 106 early-career professionals constructed video change messages involving a ban on remote working. These professionals constructed three types of statements: vision statements, direct change statements, and indirect change statements. Professionals with higher assertive-directing motivational values tended to first construct vision statements and secondly construct direct change statements, whereas professionals higher in analytic-autonomizing motivational values tended to first construct indirect change statements and secondly construct direct change statements. Overall, early-career professionals displayed strong group orientation in their rationale for change and low directness in communicating change."
The Effect of Shared Versus Individual Reflection on Team Outcomes,"Darla J. Domke-Damonte, J. Kay Keels","In this study, teams in a strategic management classroom were given one of two versions of an assignment related to the development of a team contract: independent individual reflections on desired team behaviors versus team-level reflections on desired behavioral norms. Results of a multivariate analysis of covariance, controlling for gender and individual prior achievement, indicated that teams who engaged in team-level reflection on desired team behavioral norms did not report higher teamwork satisfaction than those who had engaged in individual-level reflection on desired norms, but did report higher team effectiveness, effectiveness of their team member evaluation tool, and higher project scores."
Effectiveness of a Business Communication Course,"K. Sri Gayathridevi, R. Deepa","This study aims to show the effectiveness of a business communication course offered in a business school in India. All students who enrolled for the Master of Business Administration program in the school were considered for the study. The study adapted a pretest and posttest approach to find the effectiveness of the course. It also describes the curriculum offered and methodology followed in the school. The results show that the course was effective in improving the oral communication skills of the students. The study also discusses the implications for business schools, faculty, and students."
It’s More Than Just Talk,"Anett D. Grant, Amanda Taylor","This article investigates whether CEOs actually demonstrate the communication strengths and weaknesses they think they have. Videotaped interviews with CEOs in the initial stage of executive coaching were analyzed to identify categories of communication strength and weakness: delivery, content, audience, and character. Next, the interviews and transcriptions were coded to track use of rhetorical formats, delivery stress, disfluencies, and timing. Speakers who identified themselves as having both delivery and content strengths or weaknesses differed significantly from the other CEOs. This has important implications for the study of impromptu communication, executive coaching, and business communication."
Testing the Recognition and Perception of Errors in Context,Laura C. Brandenburg,"This study tests the recognition of errors in context and whether the presence of errors affects the reader’s perception of the writer’s ethos. In an experimental, posttest only design, participants were randomly assigned a memo to read in an online survey: one version with errors and one version without. Of the six intentional errors in version one, on average, readers only noticed two errors, which suggests that readers notice some but not all errors. The ethos ranking for the writer was also statistically significant between the two versions, suggesting that the presence of errors can affect the writer’s ethos."
The Competency Pivot,"Kristen Lucas, Jacob D. Rawlins","In this article, we outline a competency-based approach to teaching business communication. At the heart of this approach, classroom instruction, assignments, and evaluation center on a goals-oriented and receiver-centric understanding of communication in which students are taught strategies for meeting five core competencies of business communication: professional, clear, concise, evidence driven, and persuasive. This is not a reinvention of the curriculum but instead a pivot that positions existing disciplinary knowledge and best practices into a clear, memorable, and professionally oriented framework to help students build critical communication skills that can be applied strategically across a range of business situations."
Beyond the Generational Stereotypes,Kathryn C. Rentz,"This case study examined the extent to which expected Gen Y traits surfaced in a well-managed U.S. company. The results indicate that certain Gen Y traits typically regarded as undesirable in the workplace are especially persistent, even in an optimal organizational setting, but others are not. The findings also reveal both expected and unexpected attitudes on the part of the Gen X and Boomer employees and managers. Such studies can help us move beyond generational stereotyping to more accurate, context-sensitive advice about cross-generational communication."
Appropriating Invention Through Concept Maps in Writing for Multimedia and the Web,Florence Elizabeth Bacabac,"As an alternative approach to web preproduction, I propose the use of concept maps for invention of website projects in business and professional writing courses. This mapping device approximates our students’ initial site plans since rough ideas are formed based on a substantial exploratory technique. Incorporated in various disciplines, the construction of concept maps leads to better flowcharts and more structured wireframes for web development."
"Selections From the ABC 2014 Annual Conference, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",D. Joel Whalen,"This article, the first of a two-part series, catalogs teaching innovations from the 2014 Association for Business Communication Annual Conference. These 12 assignments debuted during two My Favorite Assignment sessions. Learning experiences included job-seeking skills—résumé writing, writing job applications, sharpening interview skills, interview performance feedback via video, peers, and handheld mirrors and communication tools—creating effective graphs, charts and figures, interactive web-based communication, crafting PowerPoint slides, managing communication anxiety via the web, and corporate social media strategy/tactics. Additional teaching materials—instructions to students, stimulus materials, slides, grading rubrics, frequently asked questions, and sample student projects—are posted on http://businesscommunication.org/assignments."
"Selections From the ABC 2014 Annual Convention, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",D. Joel Whalen,"This article, the second of a two-part series, features 11 teaching innovations presented at the 2014 Association for Business Communication annual conference. These 11 assignments included leadership and other-focused communication—detecting communication style, adaptive communication, personality type, delivering feedback, problem solving, and critical thinking—and projects—analytic reports, presentation, slide deck creation, visual tools, ethics, team communication, field observation and reporting, rhetoric, persuasion, advertising messages strategies, delivering bad news, reporting financial data, and cross-cultural and international communication. Additional teaching materials—including instructions to students, stimulus materials, slides, grading rubrics, frequently asked questions, and sample student projects—are posted on the Association for Business Communication website http://businesscommunication.org/assignments."
"Communication Competence, Leadership Behaviors, and Employee Outcomes in Supervisor-Employee Relationships","Alan C. Mikkelson, Joy A. York, Joshua Arritola","Supervisor communication competence and leadership style were used to predict specific employee outcomes. In the study, 276 participants working in various industries completed measures of communication competence and leadership styles about their direct supervisor along with measures of their job satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment. As predicted, effective and appropriate communication were both positively related to satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment. Furthermore, task- and relations-oriented leadership styles were both positively related to all three employee outcomes as well. Finally, regression analysis determined that effective communication and relations-oriented leadership were the best predictors of satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment."
Teaching Real-World Applications of Business Statistics Using Communication to Scaffold Learning,"Gareth P. Green, Stacey Jones, John C. Bean","Our assessment research suggests that quantitative business courses that rely primarily on algorithmic problem solving may not produce the deep learning required for addressing real-world business problems. This article illustrates a strategy, supported by recent learning theory, for promoting deep learning by moving students gradually from “well-structured” algorithmic problems with single correct answers to “ill-structured” real-world business problems that may have multiple correct answers and require an argument addressed to a specific audience. We show how these scaffolded communication assignments promote deep learning, and suggest ways that interested faculty can adapt the assignments to their own courses."
Why Do Scholars Use PowerPoint the Way They Do?,"Brigitte Hertz, Cees van Woerkum, Peter Kerkhof","PowerPoint has received much criticism regarding excessive use of text and the lack of contact with the audience. Why presenters use PowerPoint in this way has not been studied so far. Our study using interviews with beginning and advanced presenters shows that some use the program as a speaking note and as a means to draw the attention away from themselves. Some even think that PowerPoint can replace rhetorical skills. Slides are mainly designed on the basis of commonsense, instead of guidelines based on human information processing. Implications for the teaching of PowerPoint use in business communication are discussed."
Writing in the Professions,Tiffany Bourelle,"This article considers how professional writing courses can prepare students in various disciplines for the workforce. Specifically, I argue for Writing in the Disciplines (WID) internships where students learn to write documents relevant for their careers while participating in practical work experiences. In the WID internships I describe, instructors collaborate with coordinators across campus to establish writing-intensive internships that focus on the needs of students and the community partner. This article illustrates the collaborative endeavors of three internships, highlighting the challenges and lessons learned from WID internships."
Understanding and Using the Relationships Between Business and Professional Communication and Public Relations,John M. Penrose,"Aspects of research and pedagogy from the public relations discipline can benefit the business and professional communication instructor seeking new dimensions for the business and professional communication classroom. Elements of public relations (PR) found in Association for Business Communication articles and journals may be incorporated in the business and professional communication curriculum, but we lack a systematic overview of the overlaps between PR and business communication theory and practice. This article is a practical guide for instructors wanting to add PR content to their curriculum. It presents respective theoretical origins, media reliance similarities, common perspectives, overlaps of academic challenges for legitimacy and respectability, and potential classroom applications."
Building Problem Forums,Kyle P. Vealey,"This article describes the use of problem forums in undergraduate professional writing courses as a technique for facilitating and sustaining learning from increasingly complex, messy, and wicked problems that are characteristic of 21st-century work. Problem forums are designed to scaffold project team discussions of rhetorical, technical, or collaborative difficulties that have unexpectedly slowed or halted their work. Problem forums are thus intended to facilitate and sustain continual learning on project teams."
Flipping the Audience Script,"Chris Lam, Mark A. Hannah","This article describes a flipped classroom activity that requires students to integrate research and audience analysis. The activity uses Twitter as a data source. In the activity, students identify a sample, collect customer tweets, and analyze the language of the tweets in an effort to construct knowledge about an audience’s values, needs, and attitudes. The article first presents an overview of audience analysis frameworks. It then presents a step-by-step tutorial for integrating the activity. The authors also provide business communication instructors with resources for implementing the activity including video lectures, handouts, and instructional guides."
Cues for Better Writing,"Leo R. Vijayasarathy, Susan Martin Gould, Michael Gould","Written clarity and conciseness are desired by employers and emphasized in business communication courses. We developed and tested the efficacy of a cueing tool—Scribe Bene—to help students reduce their use of imprecise and ambiguous words and wordy phrases. Effectiveness was measured by comparing cue word usage between a treatment group given the tool and a control group without the tool. In written assignments, the treatment group used 16 of 23 cue words significantly less than the control group and this effect persisted over time. Implications for using automated cueing tools in teaching written communication skills are discussed."
Slip-Sliding-Away,"Sebastian Kernbach, Sabrina Bresciani, Martin J. Eppler","PowerPoint is a dominant communication tool in business and education. It allows for creating professional-looking presentations easily, but without understanding its constraining qualities it can be used inappropriately. Therefore we conducted a systematic literature review structuring the literature on PowerPoint in three chronological phases (Early Criticism, Heated Debate, and Scientific Take-Off) and identifying 18 constraining qualities classified into three categories: cognitive, emotional, and social. This article provides implications for educators’ and practitioners’ use (and nonuse) of PowerPoint through synthesis and description of such constraining qualities. Directions for future research are developed by identifying theoretical gaps in literature on PowerPoint."
University English and Audit Firms in the Philippines,"Pia Patricia P. Tenedero, Camilla J. Vizconde","With increasing demand for accounting professionals, audit firms are banking on universities to provide graduates equipped with technical know-how and critical English skills. This explains heightened employer concern over the business English skills of new hires, prompting questions on adequacy and relevance of English taught in universities. Hence, this study probes into English skills necessary for new accountants in audit firms. Human resource directors of top audit firms in the Philippines describe the relevant skills in the workplace tasks of entry-level employees. Findings present a model of key English skills that provide leverage to accounting graduates in the Philippines."
The Role of Communication and Cohesion in Reducing Social Loafing in Group Projects,Chris Lam,"This study examines previously untested variables that influence social loafing in professional and technical communication group projects by determining the influence of communication quality and task cohesion on social loafing. A set-up factors model, which included group size, peer review, project scope, and method of team formation, was also tested for means of comparison. The results indicated the communication quality and task cohesion model significantly reduced social loafing, explaining 53% of the variance in social loafing. The model of set-up factors only explained about 4% of the variance. The article discusses instructional strategies that foster quality communication to reduce loafing."
Evaluation of a Soft Skills Training Program,"Piyawan Charoensap-Kelly, Lauren Broussard, Mallory Lindsly, Megan Troy","This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a soft skills employee training program. We examined willingness to learn and delivery methods (face-to-face vs. online) and their associations with the training outcomes in terms of learning and behavioral change. Results showed that neither participants’ willingness to learn nor delivery methods affected comprehension. However, both variables had significant effects on the reported behavioral change. This training is effective in teaching employees how to “flex” their personal styles and to improve their relationships with each other. Implications for business and professional communication training and directions for future research are discussed in detail."
Flipping the Online Classroom With Web 2.0,Lance Cummings,"This article examines how Web 2.0 technologies can be used to “flip” the online classroom by creating asynchronous workshops in social environments where immediacy and social presence can be maximized. Using experience teaching several communication and writing classes in Google Apps (Google+, Google Hangouts, Google Drive, etc.), I argue that flipping the classroom online with Web 2.0 technologies can maximize student participation and engagement, while also helping students develop flexible strategies for writing collaboratively and publicly in online spaces."
Flipping the Composing Process,Abram Anders,"This article argues for a flipped learning approach to business and professional communication composing processes. Flipped learning sequences can scaffold more robust engagement with prewriting activities and support opportunities for in-class collaborative and facilitated drafting exercises. These types of learning experiences offer numerous pedagogical benefits, including more conscious control of messaging strategies and the development of more creative, rhetorically informed communication products. The effectiveness of this approach is explored through a case study of a flipped learning sequence and collaborative drafting workshop designed for an employment communication and résumé-writing assignment."
"“You Don’t Have to Like Me, But You Have to Respect Me”","Megan M. Lambertz-Berndt, Michael G. Blight","This study investigates cooperativeness, assertiveness, group satisfaction, leader grade, and leadership negotiation in a collaborative assignment conducted in a small group. Researchers manipulated the assignment of team members who reported on measures of group satisfaction and original scales of assertiveness and cooperativeness. Respondents also responded to open-ended questions regarding active leadership, leadership traits, and leadership negotiation, which resulted in the emergence of multiple themes. Assertiveness, cooperativeness, and group satisfaction were found to predict the grade given to the leader."
Using Digital Learning Platforms to Extend the Flipped Classroom,"Jonathan M. Balzotti, Lynn B. McCool","Although digital environments already play a vital role in the flipped classroom model, this research project shows that in university writing classrooms, innovative content design and delivery systems can extend the walls of the classroom to areas beyond, in which students transfer and connect course content with the professional world. In this article, we describe the incorporation of video learning modules into three professional communication classrooms for just such a purpose."
Best Practices for Launching a Flipped Classroom,"Ashley A. Hall, Debbie D. DuFrene","Popularity is growing for flipped classroom instruction, which replaces lectures with out-of-class delivery of streaming video, reading materials, online chats, and other modalities. Face-to-face class time is spent on instructor-student and student-student interaction, including small group problem solving and discussion. Classroom flipping has its advocates and critics. Because of the theoretical and applied aspects of business and professional communication instruction, courses in the discipline seem ideally suited to flipped instruction. This research reports on perceptions from instructors who have employed the instructional model, summarizes the insights gained, identifies best practices, and makes recommendations for future research and application."
Flipping to Teach the Conceptual Foundations of Successful Workplace Writing,Kim Sydow Campbell,"Flipping originated in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, where didactic transmission of conceptual knowledge has been the standard pedagogy. Flipping has resulted in additional focus on procedural knowledge within class meetings. This article argues that business and professional writing pedagogy, which already focuses largely on procedural knowledge within class meetings, would benefit from flipping because it could create an additional focus on conceptual knowledge outside of the classroom. The article explains why we need to teach conceptual foundations, why video is a good choice for that teaching, and what challenges we face in creating those instructional videos."
Good Pharma? How Business Communication Research Can Help Bridge the Gap Between Students and Practitioners,"Tom Bruyer, Geert Jacobs, Astrid Vandendaele","This article presents a case-based exploration of the complex interactions between learning, research, and practice in the field of business and professional communication. It focuses on a student research project in the area of corporate social responsibility in the biopharmaceutical industry. Adopting an autoethnographic approach, we aim to document the students’ development from researchers to insiders or even consultants. The findings reveal that while the students feel confident in their roles as researchers, they fail to live up to some of the commissioning practitioners’ expectations. The study concludes by providing guidelines to strengthen interaction between students and practitioners."
Business Meeting Training on Its Head,Ellen Van Praet,"This article explores the value of using embedding to extend the notion of first exposure learning in flipped classroom practices. It describes a preclass assignment for a meeting and negotiation skills course, in which students are instructed to observe an authentic business meeting, interview participants of the meeting, photograph the boardroom, draw a sketch of the seating arrangement, and write a reflective account. Its main argument is that immersion in corporate culture before class makes business communication training not only more authentic but also produces richer in-class discussions, ultimately leading to a level of metacognition associated with deep learning."
The Flipped Class,"Tammy Sherrow, Brenda Lang, Rod Corbett","Business, like many other programs in higher education, continues to rely largely on traditional classroom environments. In this article, another approach to teaching and learning, the flipped classroom, is explored. After a review of relevant literature, the authors present their experience with the flipped classroom approach to teaching and learning in a postsecondary business communication course. Instructor and student experiences with the flipped classroom are presented. Readily available tools that made the implementation of the flipped classroom approach more feasible are discussed."
Making the Familiar Strange,Deborah C. Andrews,"Business and professional communicators increasingly rely on visual thinking and design strategies to create effective messages. The workplace need for such thinking, however, is not readily accommodated in current pedagogy. A long-running study abroad short course for American students taught in London provides a model for meeting this need. Addressed to students in art and design and framed through principles of discovery learning, the course approach and assignments can be productively adapted to enhance the visual competence of students of professional communication."
“A Smile I Could Not Explain”,"Shari D. Evans, Charlie Yi, Blossom B. Baker, Eugene Crowley, Debbie S. King, Adam W. Korinek, N. Lamar Reinsch","This article reports a discourse analysis of journals from adult learners during a 1-week residency in Cape Town, South Africa. The theoretical posture is a critical dialogic perspective, making use of a postcolonial understanding of intercultural interactions. The purpose of the study was exploratory. The analysis suggests that demographic variables (e.g., race), prior international travel, and experiences during the residency influence the amount and pace of cognitive change. Results include both questions for future research and suggestions for educators."
PowerPoint Slides as Speaking Notes,"Brigitte Hertz, Peter Kerkhof, Cees van Woerkum","PowerPoint presentations are often criticized for the excessive use of text on the slides. In a study of 97 academic scholars, we found that presenters indeed used substantially more text than is advised. Speaking anxiety was found to be related to the time spent on preparing and rehearsing, and time spent on rehearsing is related to the number of words on the slides. Anxious presenters appear to use PowerPoint slides as speaking notes. Presenters should be trained to overcome their speaking anxiety by means other than the abundant use of words on their slides."
"The Whys, Hows, and Lessons Learned From Our 780-Person Writing Class","Robert Bowse, Holly Lawrence","Two business communication faculty share the story of teaching a 780-person business writing class. The article discusses the challenges of teaching such a large writing class. Challenges ranged from adopting a hybrid course model to hiring adjunct faculty for help with the task of grading. The article offers lessons learned, and recommends that one proceed with caution when considering a superlarge format for writing instruction. Both theory and experience are used to support this position."
Employer Perceptions of Oral Communication Competencies Most Valued in New Hires as a Factor in Company Success,"Lorelei A. Ortiz, Michelle Region-Sebest, Catherine MacDermott","This article presents findings of a 2014 survey of 72 U.S. employers asking: Which oral communication skills are most utilized daily by new hires? Which oral skills are most important to company success? The study utilized Qualtrics to administer a mixed-methods, 12-question survey to employers of various sizes and across various industries. Findings show that employers rank (a) proper grammar use, (b) team communication, (c) ability to engage in conversation, (d) meeting participation, and (e) ability to speak well using the telephone as the most valued oral competencies for new hires as a factor in company success."
Flipping the Class,Lora Arduser,"Business communication evolves and adapts to suit the times, and today’s workplace documents are increasingly multimodal. Therefore, business and professional communication specialists need to adapt to a new media workplace ecology—one that requires proficiencies with technologies such as video production, digital animation, and sound. Business and professional writing teachers, in turn, need to adopt teaching methods that include working with evolving technologies and be willing to teach multimodal skills to students. In this article I offer a case study of a flipped learning pedagogy to teach multimodal skills in the professional writing classroom."
Social Media in Business and Professional Communication Courses,"Emil B. Towner, Bruce R. Klemz","Students raised with pervasive technology are believed to have developed skills and ways of thinking that require new approaches to education. Often, social media is lauded as the answer, but a large gap remains in understanding student preferences regarding social media in courses. We uncover those preferences with data obtained from an anonymous survey of 368 students in large lecture classes. Our research focuses on social media preferences as well as differences in major, gender, and experience with social media for coursework. We discuss three lessons that can be applied immediately and suggestions for future research."
"Selections From the ABC 2015 Annual Conference, Seattle, Washington",D. Joel Whalen,"This article, the first of a two-part series, presents teaching 10 innovations from the 2015 Association for Business Communication’s 80th annual conference. The creative new assignments offered here include building listening skills by journaling, oral interpretation, positive message framing, storytelling, delivering bad news, persuasive messages, and learning by teaching. Additional assignment support materials—instructions to students, stimulus materials, slides, grading rubrics, frequently asked questions, and sample student projects—are posted on these websites: http://www.businesscommunication.org/page/assignments and http://www.salesleadershipcenter.com/research.html#mfa16."
Teaching Soft Skills to Business Students,"Suzanne Anthony, Benjamin Garner","Recent reports have suggested that many employees in the workforce today lack essential soft skills. This research analyzes the effectiveness of multiple classroom assignments for teaching soft skills in a Business Communication course. Five distinct pedagogical strategies were used in an effort to teach soft skills, including a self-analysis, an interview, a guest lecturer, a journal article, and a soft skills video. Results offer insights into students’ perceptions of the most helpful pedagogical approaches for teaching soft skills."
Business Communication Practices From Employers’ Perspectives,"Tina A. Coffelt, Matthew J. Baker, Robert C. Corey","This study investigates the meaning of communication skills from employers’ perspectives. Students enrolled in a business communication course were asked to contact potential employers in their fields of interest, requesting information about important communication skills in those fields. Using content analysis, two coders familiar with business communication analyzed 52 of the resulting open-ended responses. The analysis of 165 skills suggests employers recall oral communication more frequently than written, visual, or electronic communication skills. Of oral communication subskills, interpersonal communication was mentioned more than other workplace communication skills."
"I Communicate, Therefore I Belong","Stephanie L. Dailey, Jeffrey W. Treem, Jacob S. Ford","Although research has explored employees’ organizational identification, few scholars have investigated liminal workers’ identification. This gap is problematic because nonmembers represent organizations and their attachments may influence their work. To understand this poorly understood phenomenon, we conducted interviews with agency social media writers who were not employed by organizations they represented online. Contrary to practitioners avowing that only internal employees can communicate via social media, we found agency writers adopt multiple identification lenses, which lead to different work practices. These results contribute to organizational, stakeholder, and consumer-company identification research and help social media writers better communicate on behalf of organizations."
"Selections From the ABC 2015 Annual Conference, Seattle, Washington",D. Joel Whalen,"This article, the second of a two-part series, presents 10 teaching innovations from the 2015 Association for Business Communication’s annual conference. Innovations include fresh approaches to teaching cross-cultural communication consulting, creating promotional material with graphical software, a Pecha Kucha approach to oral presentations, email skills, creating digital résumés and LinkedIn profiles, promoting flash-mob events via social media, rapid message packaging, and writing 140-character mission statements. Additional teaching materials—instructions to students, stimulus materials, slides, grading rubrics, frequently asked questions, and sample student projects—are posted on these websites: http://www.businesscommunication.org/page/assignments and http://www.salesleadershipcenter.com/research.html#mfa16."
Graduate Employability and Communication Competence,"Trish L. Clokie, Elna Fourie","This research establishes the role of communication education in employability by determining how employers of graduates view communication, identifying communication skills that employers view as relevant, and establishing whether these skills are included in communication courses. To achieve these aims, local businesses were surveyed, and the results were compared with communication course descriptors. The research shows, consistent with worldwide trends, that local employers value communication competencies highly when recruiting new graduates, and specific communication skills required in an industry reflect course content. However, some skills are still lacking, and the research questions where the responsibility lies in developing these skills."
Workplace Simulation,"Norhayati Ismail, Chitra Sabapathy","In the redesign of a professional communication course for real estate students, a workplace simulation was implemented, spanning the entire 12-week duration of the course. The simulation was achieved through the creation of an online company presence, the infusion of communication typically encountered in the workplace, and an intensive and integrated approach to task design. An analysis of students’ and tutors’ perceptions of the changes shows higher student engagement, with the redesigned course resulting in learning that is both relevant and meaningful to workplace communication, which has implications for the teaching and learning of professional communication skills in higher education."
Developing Communication Management Skills,"Dale Cyphert, Elena Nefedova Dodge, Leslie K. Duclos (Wilson)","The value of experiential learning is widely acknowledged, especially for the development of communication skills, but students are not always aware of their own learning. While we can observe students practicing targeted skills during the experiential activity, the experience can also color their explicit understanding of those skills. Transfer of applied knowledge to managerial contexts requires an explicit grasp of the skills as appropriate solutions to the problems they encounter within the experiential team. This article reports the adaptation of assessment processes to encourage the reflection steps necessary for developing the desired managerial perspective on team communication."
Invisible Transfer,Danica L. Schieber,"Much research shows that students do not transfer learning well from one class to the next. This study was designed to investigate if students were transferring rhetorical strategies from their disciplinary courses to advanced writing courses. The findings suggest that business majors not only transferred rhetorical knowledge from their other courses, but they did so in a way that is invisible to both themselves and their own writing instructors."
Mobile or Not? Assessing the Instructional Value of Mobile Learning,"Catherine Nickerson, Chrysi Rapanta, Valerie Priscilla Goby","Our aim was to explore the influence of mobile learning on students’ acquisition of conceptual knowledge of business communication, as well as on the development of their communication skills. We compared the performance of three groups of students according to the pedagogical approach that we used with them: a mobile learning group, a conventional group, and a control group. Our findings suggest that a mobile learning intervention leads to an improvement in student performance in a formal assessment and that it will also have a positive impact on learning outcomes."
Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility on Social Media,"Moonhee Cho, Lauren D. Furey, Tiffany Mohr","The purpose of this study was to explore what corporations with good reputations communicate on social media. Based on a content analysis of 46 corporate Facebook pages from Fortune’s “World’s Most Admired Companies,” this study found that corporations communicate noncorporate social responsibility messages more frequently than corporate social responsibility (CSR) messages. When communicating CSR activities, corporations employed an informing strategy more often than an interacting strategy and included internal publics’ activities more than external publics. This study also found that publics engage more with noncorporate social responsibility messages than CSR messages, which may reflect public cynicism of CSR communication."
Grammatical Versus Pragmatic Error,"Joanna Wolfe, Nisha Shanmugaraj, Jaclyn Sipe","Many communication instructors make allowances for grammatical error in nonnative English speakers’ writing, but do businesspeople do the same? We asked 169 businesspeople to comment on three versions of an email with different types of errors. We found that businesspeople do make allowances for errors made by nonnative English speakers, perceiving these errors as less bothersome than those made by native speakers. We also found that businesspeople perceive pragmatic errors of politeness and tone as even more bothersome than grammatical error—a finding we share with our students to persuade them of the importance of polite and professional email correspondence."
Do Employers Forgive Applicants’ Bad Spelling in Résumés?,"Christelle Martin-Lacroux, Alain Lacroux","Spelling deficiencies are becoming a growing concern among employers, but few studies have quantified this phenomenon and its impact on recruiters’ choice. This article aims to highlight the relative weight of the form (the spelling skills) in application forms, compared with the content (the level of work experience), in recruiters’ judgment during the selection process. The study asked 536 professional recruiters to evaluate different application forms. The results show that the presence of spelling errors has the same detrimental impact on the chances of being shortlisted as a lack of professional experience, and recruiters’ spelling skills also moderate their judgment."
Professional Communication as Phatic: From Classical Eunoia to Personal Artificial Intelligence,James E. Porter,"Phatic refers to the rhetorical function of creating effective communication channels, keeping them open, and establishing ongoing and fruitful relationships, all of which are vital in the age of digital rhetoric, social media, and global intercultural exchange. In this realm, the professional communicator functions less as an originator of new information and more as a space designer, a facilitator of others’ online interactions, a curator of user-generated content, and a communication leader. The phatic function—especially relevant to online interactions such as virtual teamwork, intercultural communication, and user help forums—deserves significant attention as a primary purpose for professional communication."
Breaking Bad in Business Education: Impacts on Student Incivility and Academic Dishonesty,"Evan H. Offstein, Rebecca M. Chory","The present study examines instructors’ attempts to increase student satisfaction through what we predict to be destructive communication tactics. Results indicate that business majors reported being more likely to engage in incivility and academic dishonesty in courses taught by professors who attempted to gain student favor through gossiping, self-disclosure, and downward convergence. Furthermore, perceptions of the instructor’s ethical character mediated the relationships between instructor behaviors and student incivility. Given the centrality of the professor in developing future managers and employees, we discuss implications for business and professional education and advocate for a return to a more traditional business professor role."
Gamification in the Business Communication Course,Jennifer R. Veltsos,"Interest in gamification in higher education has been growing steadily in the past decade. Using games and game elements has been shown to increase student engagement, motivation, and autonomy. This article draws parallels between game elements, instructional design, and the teaching of business and professional communication. It suggests ways that teachers can incorporate game elements into their courses (or perhaps identifies ways in which readers are already doing so without realizing it). The article concludes with an example of how game elements are used in the design of an introductory business communication course."
Enhancing Student Learning Through Scaffolded Client Projects,Elizabeth Tomlinson,"This article reports on the current status of client projects (CPs) in business communication courses, provides a scaffolded model for implementing CP, and assesses student learning in CPs. Using a longitudinal mixed method research design, survey data and qualitative materials from six semesters are presented. The instructor survey indicated need for a model for CPs, assistance identifying community partners, and advice on tailoring CPs to course objectives, all of which are provided here. Results from assessing the model’s application indicate that students expressed higher levels of confidence as communicators and felt better prepared to engage in workplace communication."
Modified Immersive Situated Service Learning,Natasha N. Jones,"Distinctions between traditional service learning and critical service learning with a social justice focus are important when structuring professional writing courses and defining course outcomes. This article presents a hybrid pedagogical approach for designing a critical service-learning course that integrates a social justice curriculum while focusing specifically on reflection, context, and positionality. Detailing the course design and sharing reflections from students and the instructor, the author argues that the modified immersive situated service-learning approach provides professional communication students the opportunity to become agents of change."
Tackling the Survey: A Learning-by-Induction Design,Anne E. Witte,"Free online survey tools provide a practical learning-by-induction platform for business communication instructors interested in trying out an advanced multidisciplinary survey activity coupled with an innovative teaching design. More than just building skills in marketing, survey projects marshal a wider set of thinking and doing activities that build student competency in the interrelated disciplines of communication, consumer analysis, and research. The design and sequence of a survey-learning module are outlined as well as expected learning outcomes, assessment considerations, and suggestions for exploring the interdisciplinary opportunities that surveys afford."
Establishing an Interview Anxiety Baseline: Assessing Applicants’ Readiness,"Lori Boyer, Lila Carden, Lars Johnson, Raphael Boyd","This research includes survey data about the types of anxiety levels that college students experience while preparing for job interviews. Survey findings included female students reporting higher levels of anxiety than their male counterparts on four of the five scales. Results suggest that additional training for female applicants could reduce anxiety levels and help them excel in job interviews. Implications for job applicants, academic communities, and recruiters are discussed. The article concludes with study limitations and suggestions for future research."
Longitudinal Analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility on Company Websites,Katherine Taken Smith,"As social issues increase, so does the scope of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Companies are expanding their CSR activities and making the terminology used to describe them more specific. This study compares website content of Fortune 500 companies in 2015 with content collected in 2011. Traditionally, two CSR issues have been the dominant focus on company websites: community and environment. Findings reveal that these terms have decreased in usage and new terms have emerged, such as supply chain and volunteer involvement. A shift has occurred that business practitioners will find helpful in communicating CSR initiatives."
Teaching Large Sections of a Business Communication Course,Carol Wright,"The purpose of this research is to examine specific examples of how business communication courses are delivered in large, face-to-face university classes to discover implications of these large courses. This case study reviewed four classes from two different midsized universities whose classes range from 48 to 300 students. Findings suggest that, when faced with the possibility of teaching more students, it is important to understand that pedagogical strategies may need to be adjusted to maintain student learning. These strategies include modifying the course to the lecture/lab structure, limiting the amount of writing, or allowing the instructor to teach fewer courses."
Increasing Student Interaction in Technical Writing Courses in Online Environments,Drew Virtue,This article examines how the levels of student interaction change through the use of small groups and moderators in online writing courses. The study examines three technical and professional online writing courses: one course that employs small groups and group moderators and two courses that have no small groups or moderators. The results of this study show that the amount of interaction between students in online writing courses increases dramatically by incorporating small groups and peer moderators.

"Job-Searching Expectations, Expectancy Violations, and Communication Strategies of Recent College Graduates",Stephanie A. Smith,"Expectancy violations theory, a communicative framework, is applied in this study to understand how recent college graduates form, evaluate, and respond to violated job-searching expectations. In-depth interviews of college seniors (N = 20) who were currently job searching helped answer the three research questions posed. Using a thematic analysis, the findings indicate that young job seekers evaluate some negative information positively because it reduces their uncertainty and that expectations and responses to expectancy violations change over time and are not stagnant, as the theory originally predicted. Other contributions, limitations, and teaching implications are discussed."
Rhetorical Analysis of Fast-Growth Businesses’ Job Advertisements: Implications for Job Search,"Craig L. Engstrom, James T. Petre, Elizabeth A. Petre","This article presents findings from a rhetorical analysis of job advertisements posted by the fastest growing companies in the United States (Inc. 5000 rankings). The analysis suggests that companies rely on standard rhetorical figures and share similar rhetorical visions of novelty that likely effect their organizational culture, paradoxically make them homogeneous, and potentially oversell positions that require prosaic job duties. Suggestions to authors of job advertisements include writing with fewer clichés and metaphors, since they tend to reify ageist stereotypes. Suggestions for job seekers include doing rhetorical analyses of advertisements and writing résumés so they comply with job advertisements’ creative rhetorical styles."

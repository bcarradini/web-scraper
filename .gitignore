# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore all log files and output files
/logs

# Ignore journal-scrapers (a 3rd-party library of scraper examples)
/journal-scrapers

# Ignore output/split/ directory
/output/split/*
/output/http*

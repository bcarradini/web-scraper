"Economics discourse is now seen as characterized by intersubjectivity and interactivity, since economists take a stance by using lexico-grammatical elements and rhetorical features to build a convincing argument from a personal perspective, to attain solidarity with readers, and to claim social participation in the economics community. Evaluation and particularly evaluative adjectives are thus a crucial feature of economics discourse. Taking a qualitative and quantitative approach, this study explores, in a small specialized corpus, the functions of evaluative adjectives, their variation across genres and registers, and whether they are constrained by the specific domain of economics. Findings show that evaluative adjectives can adopt more than one function simultaneously, they vary across genres and registers, and that they are strongly constrained by domain. Moreover, given the need to use specialized language internationally, this study wants to build, especially in NNS economists, an awareness of the features which typify economics discourse and a better understanding of the crucial role evaluative adjectives hold when economists have to communicate critical perspectives while building their professional persona. © 2006 IEEE.""Technical writers have often used scissors and glue to 'cut and paste' their own material or other printed material to produce appropriate copy. The advent of computerized data bases and word processing systems gave technical writers a powerful new tool. This paper describes two ways in which technical writers can use computers to cut and paste more efficiently: The first method, retrieving information from on-line data bases, is really just a more efficient way of doing something that's been done before. The second method, using 'model components' to generate customized information from descriptions stored on-line, is new. It enables technical writers to create and tailor information as it is being included in a draft and significantly affects the way technical writers do their job.""This article describes the development of visual rhetoric in a historically significant museum exhibit. The study documents rhetorical change in the museum's displays, specifically in visual series depicting the horse's evolutionary development. The study also exposes the purpose of series patterning in the renovated display and the multiple views on scientific visualization this display implies. Such an analysis suggests the broad range of strategies in visual rhetoric available to science communicators working in the area of science popularization. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""This article calls for a rhetorical perspective on the relationship of gender, communication, and power in the workplace. In doing so, the author uses narrative in two ways. First, narratives gathered in an ethnographic study of an actual workplace, a plastics manufacturer, are used as a primary source of data, and second, the findings of this study are presented by telling the story of two women in this workplace. Arguing that gender in the workplace, like all social identities, is locally constructed through the micro practices of everyday life, the author questions some of the prevailing assumptions about gender at work and cautions professional communication teachers, researchers, and practitioners against unintentionally perpetuating global, decontextualized assumptions about gender and language, and their relationship to the distribution and exercise of power at work.""This inquiry explores the practical implications of constructivist theory for documentation that is targeted to complex tasks and experienced users (users who are less than experts but more than novices). It argues that current task-oriented documentation falls short in addressing these tasks and users and examines the contributions that constructivism can make, contributions that will lead to documentation that differs in kind not just degree from conventional task-oriented manuals and help systems. This inquiry synthesizes the following four themes from constructivist theory and analyzes their relevance to documentation development: (1) changing the object of instruction to ""activity in context,"" (2) shaping instruction around problems experienced by users in work contexts, (3) highlighting users' social stock of knowledge, and (4) adopting a rhetoric of problem-based instruction expressed through cases. Examples are given from current efforts in interface and instructional design that writers may adapt to documentation design.""This study investigates politeness strategies within meetings of designers who met face-to-face and technical communicators who met via teleconference and, more specifically, politeness strategies of existing members toward group newcomers and vice versa. Based on the results of this study, I suggest that issues of power and social distance affect politeness strategies by both groups during their initial interactions and suggest that technical communication educators should better prepare students by teaching benefits, detriments, and realities of particular linguistic politeness choices. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."This article investigates the role of speech accommodation by native and nonnative speakers of English in a series of international business meetings. The study first of all reveals an awareness by some participants of the need to adjust language for an international audience and an intuitive understanding of some of the ways this can be achieved. Analysis of the meetings' discourse further illustrates some of the normalization and convergence strategies used by some participants throughout the meetings to accommodate linguistic differences and difficulties. It is suggested that such authentic examples could be used as the basis for business communication training resources to help both native and nonnative speakers communicate more effectively in international contexts. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication."Expert legal reports exhibit what Carolyn Miller calls the ""pragmatic dimension"" of genre, namely, a capacity to engage in two very different kinds of discursive activities simultaneously. The first, what I call the strategic function, ""helps virtual communities, the relationships we carry around in our heads, to reproduce and reconstruct themselves,"" and the second, what I call the tactical function, ""help[s] real people in spatio-temporal communities to do their work and carry out their purposes"" (75). This article examines two psycholegal reports, showing how these strategic and tactical activities work together in a way that is complementary and ideological: complementary, because the relationship is one of foreground to background, with the strategic activity of the report predominating - and thus covering over - its tactical operations; ideological, because both activities serve to naturalize and reproduce the status of experts and of the law generally.""The Brookhaven story illustrates how a research facility, driven by scientific and technological expediency, fails to negotiate their interests with the interests and values of the neighboring communities. As environmental damage at stake is arguably nonessential, the case allows instructors to concentrate strictly on communication issues. A series of short, related assignments raise students awareness of communication challenges various public groups face in a contemporary democratic society. The case allows instructors to engage students in solving communication problems, building arguments, analyzing websites, and writing workplace-documents letters, reports, or proposals-that respond to the complex context. © 2004 IEEE.""This essay examines the differences between Canadian and American cultures as they manifest themselves in business discourse. Studies of Canadian identity note the complexity inherent in a multicultural society such as Canada, but they also identify some of the common characteristics - a concern for and tolerance of others, awareness of class distinctions, concern for the collective over the individual. This distinct Canadian identity affects genres such as the direct marketing letter because the genre depends on shared understandings between writers and readers; these understandings in turn depend upon cultural values. The essay then examines direct mail letters addressed to both Canadian and American addresses using concepts from cross-cultural communication: power distance, directness, and individualism. Two pairs of letters - one written for Canadians, one for Americans - that have similar goals are then examined to identify the differences between their approaches to each audience. Business communicators need to be aware that Canadians see themselves as culturally distinct, and they need to write differently for Canadian audiences. More research that identifies specific reader's responses to direct marketing letters is needed. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""The aim of this paper is to explore the current state of technical communication in Finland, with a look into the future of the field as practitioners see it. This article is part of a larger study investigating technical communication through activity theory. Method: The study utilizes autoethnographic interview data to explore and analyze some of the issues technical communicators are currently facing, and how these issues affect their expectations for the future. The literature of the field is used to further illustrate the points made. Results:User-centeredness is widely recognized as one of the main quality factors in technical communication, but the current work processes of the field do not allow technical communicators access to users or user data. The interviewees are not satisfied with their current work conditions and fear for the future of the field. Conclusion: It is discovered that while we are currently facing serious problems, there is still a need for user advocates in the product development process. A new model for technical communication is needed in order for the field to survive.""Work is described on a National Science Foundation grant that supports the development, assessment, and dissemination of ""micro-insertion"" problems designed to integrate ethics into the graduate engineering curriculum. In contrast to traditional modular approaches to ethics pedagogy, micro-insertions introduce ethical issues by means of a ""low-dose"" approach. Following a description of the micro-insertion approach, we outline the workshop structure being used to teach engineering faculty and graduate students how to write micro-insertions for graduate engineering courses, with particular attention to how the grant develops engineering students' (and faculty members') ability to communicate across disciplinary boundaries. We also describe previous and planned methods for assessing the effectiveness of micro-insertions. Finally, we explain the role that technical communication faculty and graduate students are playing as part of the grant team, specifically in developing an Ethics In-Basket that will disseminate micro-insertions developed during the grant. © 2009 IEEE.""Text-based interviews that compared the teacher's intention for a given comment on an engineering student's paper with the student's understanding of the comment were used to examine the extent to which students understand the comments they receive and to determine the characteristics of comments that are well understood and those that are not. The teachers' comments analyzed in this study were fully understood only about half the time. Inclusion of a reason or explicit instructions helped students understand the comments. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""In a national survey, 500 technical communicators and 500 technical communication teachers were asked to assess the ethics of seven document design cases. According to the 455 respondents, manipulating typography and leading to fit more or less information on a page and using persuasive coloring or spacing are ethical practices, while the manipulation of pictorial illustrations and the distortion of graphics are unethical. Opinion on using typography to decrease readability is divided. In five of the seven cases, women are consistently more lenient or men consistently more strict in their evaluations of ethics. Respondents offered nine different types of explanations for their answers: common practices, specifications, reader's responsibility, writer's responsibility, writer's intentions, consequences, judgments, principles, and insufficient information. The explanation most often given was consequences, indicating a ""goal-based"" philosophy of ethics.""We advocate for problem-based learning (PBL) as a rhetorical pedagogy for business communication. Briefly put, classic PBL inverts the typical instructional sequence; rather than presenting concepts first and then asking students to apply them, PBL creates situations in which students must learn the concepts in order to solve a ""problem"" constructed for that purpose. Thus, students learn in an iterative process as they cycle through the three key questions: ""What do we know?"" ""What do we need to know?"" and ""How will we learn it?"" We advocate emphasizing three key elements inherent in classic PBL: rhetoricity, locality, and change. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article traces the early implementation phase of a set of knowledge management tools in four customer call support centers within a multinational corporation. Through a case study analysis, this article addresses two fundamental issues. First, the article investigates how the organization keeps a new type of knowledge worker - the relatively unskilled, low-paid customer call support technicians who staff the phones at centers around the United States - current with the latest information on those products they support. Second, data from the case study suggest specific innovation factors that discourage technicians from adopting the knowledge tools. © 2004 by the Association for Business Communication.""Using activity theory as a supplement to genre studies, this article explores a case of the disintegration of a traditional engineering firm. It focuses on the causes of such disintegration and the role of different types of communication in serving as sites where contradictions can be brought to visibility and resolution. The authors' goal is both to show the power of activity theory in illuminating issues of tension, contradiction, and dissonance that lead to the breakup of the original organization into two separate firms and point to fundamental differences in the cultures of traditional engineering firms and software design enterprises.""This case study focuses on images in three Science articles on the ivory-billed woodpecker, whose rediscovery was recently heralded. Because the primary piece of evidence is a frustratingly fuzzy four-second video, two groups of authors ultimately disagree on its interpretation and the same still video images that are used to argue for the sighting are used to argue against it. Given that the authors are making taxonomic arguments, images that closely resemble reality are employed. These images, like all images, are coded, and this analysis seeks to unlock these visual codes to reveal how meaning is made at the site of production, the site of the image, and the site of the audience. It also exposes how meaning making at the site of the image fueled the controversy.""This article examines the rhetoric employed by the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to communicate the risks of nuclear power to legislators and the public. Close reading of official and unofficial documents demonstrates the importance of developing an effective risk-communication strategy in anticipation of danger rather than in response.

But is this greater choice beneficial? To find out, we ran two experimental studies to examine the effects of increasing option set-size on anticipated and experienced choice perceptions in the modern context of online mate choice. While participants expected greater enjoyment, increased satisfaction, and less regret when choosing from larger (versus smaller) sets of prospective partners (at least up to a point; Study 1), participants presented with a supposedly ideal number of options experienced no improvement in affect and showed more memory confusions regarding their choice than did those participants presented with fewer options (Study 2). Participants correctly anticipated that greater choice would yield increasing costs, but they overestimated the point at which this would occur. We offer an evolutionary-cognitive framework within which to understand this misperception, discuss factors that may make it difficult for decision-makers to correct for it, and suggest ways in which dating websites could be designed to help users choose from large option sets. © 2008 IEEE.""Using the framework of conversation analysis, the author examines the structure of interaction in computer-mediated team meetings, focusing on the openings and closings of the team's four virtual meetings. The author describes how the medium, quasisynchronous chat (QSC), disrupts the temporal flow of conversation and makes beginning and ending these informally structured meetings difficult. The author finds that the team, as a result, evolved a two-stage process for both opening and closing the meetings, which allowed them to make consistent use of certain linguistic and conversational devices to mark possible transition points for openings and closings. The author discusses how these virtual meetings compare to face-to-face interactions and some possible implications for the use of QSC for virtual team meetings.""Studying past examples of successful technical communication may offer insight into strategies that worked with technologies and audiences in an earlier time. This article examines the texts documenting a controversy before and during the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. Ellen Swallow Richards, chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Bertha Honore Palmer, president of the Fair's Board of Lady Managers, had distinctly different visions of how cooking technology should be presented. Palmer invited Richards to create a Model Kitchen in the Woman's Building, but Richards wanted to avoid gendering the new knowledge of nutrition and she fought to control her exhibit. The multimedia Richards used in her resulting Rumford Kitchen exhibit reminds us that sometimes an entertaining but familiar atmosphere might be the best way to introduce threatening new knowledge and technology, particularly to our increasingly international and intergenerational audiences.""This article documents a novel yet theory-informed process of preparing research reports designed for government officials who are concerned with creating adult-literacy policy. The authors use cartoons that include verbatim dialogue from the transcripts of interviews with research participants with low functional literacy. This dialogue, which depicts positive messages about the participants' moral character, strengths, and resilience, is set against photographic backdrops of the participants' lived environment to give a sense of real people in a real place. Inclusion of such images is an attempt to change policy-report readers' thinking about adult literacy because creative visual communication offers ways to approach this challenge that text alone cannot. © 2009 SAGE Publications.""Teachers of technical writing are urged to use computers not only for influencing the process of writing but also for designing and formatting the product of writing. Engineering students at a Midwestern university now submit final drafts of senior projects in commercial-style formats, thus increasing their range of skills in the act of preparing final written products and adopting some conventions of communicating in the workplace. Reformatting student writing to mimic commercial-quality writing not only increases the scope and responsibility of writing instruction, but also better prepares students to adapt to communication situations in the workplace.""This article gives a canonical sequential analysis of openings and closings based on a corpus of department meetings. The first section of the article shows how opening a meeting constitutes a shift in turn-taking system. The second section identifies five techniques used in opening meetings. The third section identifies six techniques used in closing meetings. The final section of the article concludes how openings and closings mirror each other, with similar ""stepping stones"" to be ""traveled""; and discusses the potential of this being a canonical and cross-cultural model. The study has implications for the community of conversation analysts, for business communication studies, and for practitioners. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""The views concerning ""dangling participles"" of grammarians, usage experts and authors of books on technical writing are reviewed and compared. Although many unattached clauses are clearly unacceptable, some are less objectionable and still others are acceptable practice. Absolute constructions and other clause-relational participial, infinitival and verbless clauses need no attachment to a proximate noun or noun phrase, and logical clauses that are not attached to a noun are shown as normal, acceptable use. Even clearly adjectival clauses are often unattached when followed by the passive voice, intransitives and several other grammatical structures; clauses between the subject and verb and at the end of the sentence are also often not attached to the immediately preceding noun. Cultural (perhaps also gender) differences between humanistic teachers and task-oriented engineers are noted as possible causes of different viewpoints regarding the use of unattached participles, and greater acceptance of the many acceptable forms of unattached clauses is argued. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""E-mail privacy in the workplace has emerged as one of the most complex ethical and legal issues confronting corporate communication in the electronic age. This paper discusses the array of legal and ethical concerns of e-mail privacy in the workplace. Building on the existing body of knowledge on the topic, the results of a research study are presented which explore the similarities and differences in e-mail usage and privacy perceptions among management level and administrative level employees. The survey, which polled 337 working professionals, confirmed the popular belief that companies are not effectively communicating their e-mail monitoring policies to their employees. Finally, recommendations are made to corporate communicators on how best to forge an e-mail communications policy that can reduce the risk of disputes, incidents, and lawsuits regarding e-mail privacy issues.""A significant part of the work in business settings, especially in multinational projects, is done through talking over the phone in conference calls. The differences in the setting in comparison with face-to-face meetings create a new dynamic of talk and turn taking because of the lack of body language. This article analyzes a number of the differences between these two types of meetings, using a corpus of (International) Business English, in which the multinational participants discuss an information technology research project. English is used as a lingua franca among participants from different companies and different nationalities (e.g., Dutch, German, Italian, Spanish). Features studied include self-identification, the number of turns, interruptions, overlaps, back-channeling behavior, pauses, side comments, small talk, breaks, distribution of talk, meeting structure, and length of conferences. The findings show that because of the lack of body language signals, there are differences in most of these features, for example, fewer interruptions, overlaps, and pauses in concalls than in face-to-face meetings. Small talk is restricted to the end or beginning of calls if it happens at all, side comments do not happen among the participants but may occur with people outside the conference. Back channels occur more frequently in conference calls, as they constitute the only means of communicating attention. The latter highlights the concerns for politeness to secure good working relationships in business relations. © 2012 Association for Business Communication.""Social tagging ranges among the ""killer applications"" of Web 2.0. An ever-growing international community uses Web sites such as the photo database Flickr and the bookmarking service Delicious. In addition, a number of other portals use tagging to compile user-specific metadata on information on any subject-whether it be travel destinations, personal contacts, films, or museum exhibits. Retrieving and storing information via tagging seems to meet users' needs for a number of purposes and in many contexts. Starting with a synopsis of the current literature on social tagging and then focusing on the results of two surveys-qualitative interviews and an online questionnaire-this article explores the potential and limitations of tagging as a tool for organizing shared and personal knowledge. © 2009 Sage Publications.""Building on Herndl's concept of critical practice, this article presents a case study of attempts to change the discourse practices surrounding breast-feeding in today's medical environment. To complicate readers' understanding of rhetorical agency, resistance, and discursive change, the author considers the rhetorical efforts of two high-profile physicians alongside those of the nonphysician breast-feeding advocates she interviewed. Ultimately, this dual perspective shows that discursive efforts to change medical practices can fail, even when supported by powerful figures within the medical establishment, if the new ideas communicated in such efforts conflict with long-established material conditions. © 2005 Sage Publications.""Technology is commonly described in magical terms, not only in advertising but also in journalism and technical communication. This article provides some background on the use of magical language in technical contexts, gives examples of magical discourse in technology advertisements and newsmagazine articles, and proposes a technical communication pedagogy of media analysis. The proposed pedagogy involves students in conducting diagnostic critiques of media texts and affords them the opportunity to examine critically their own unwitting use of magical language in technical discourse.""This article explores the functional elegance of direct mail as it constructs its target audience. More specifically, it examines direct mailings included in a nationally publicized court case involving Publishers' Clearing House and articulates how the use of particular genre-based, rhetorical and linguistic strategies in these mailings construct reader identity. It argues that the documents use you-attitude to construct the identity of the reader as winner, implied reader devices to reinforce the reader's identity as winner and to establish the reader's identity as the writer's friend, and linguistic politeness strategies to build feelings of solidarity of the reader toward the writer. It concludes with the observation that the direct mail in our study, rather than being ""junk,"" is really a skillfully written set of documents, successfully interweaving various discourse strategies and raising both ethical and professional issues in the process. © 2003 by the Association for Business Communication.""Conventional phrases have existed in business letters since at least 1589, but both the number of phrases in conventional use and the phrases which consti tute jargon have changed. Texts have criticized jargon since at least 1914, but the phrases texts criticize continue to be used. Terms become conventional be cause inexperienced business writers copy existing correspondence. Jargon persists because people think that business letters should use jargon and be cause using jargon enables authors to write or dictate quickly. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Students were surveyed throughout the project, and they also participated in a focus group discussion at the end. The aim was to evaluate their experience with learning from a peer-generated iBook and to identify any motivating factors behind it. The study showed that incorporating mobile learning into the business communication classroom was highly meaningful for the students involved for a range of different reasons. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article uses genre-field analysis (GFA) to examine Minecraft griefing guides: user-generated documentation that operationalizes destructive approaches to gameplay. Griefing guides promote subversive praxis while forwarding a utilitarian ethical system that alues hedonistic schadenfreude, running counter to morals of cooperation championed by most Minecraft players. Published in online forums where debates over conflicting praxis continue, these guides explicitly address, rather than mask, the negotiation of ideological values and ethical systems within a community. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Document ownership attributions often have direct consequences for evaluation, in both classrooms and workplaces. But when writers work collaboratively, ownership attributions are not straightforward. This study, about how and why collaborative writers make such attributions, reports that interviewed workplace writers emphasized product criteria (quality and Liabllity), while surveyed student writers emphasized process criteria (teamwork and workload). A review of previous research suggests that such a difference may result from cultural differences between the academy and the workplace. That analysis further suggests how both instructors and practitioners could help newcomers make successful transitions to professional writing, by foregrounding ownership attitudes. © 1994 IEEE.""When a vehicle maintenance unit of a public transit agency underwent extensive demographic diversification of its work force, original workers escalated the symbolic actions and language patterns traditionally used to establish and maintain hierarchy in that workplace. Taken literally and seen as malicious by new workers, the shoptalk and horseplay became vehicles for internal power struggles that led the organization toward dysfunction and even violence. Management responded by stepping up structural control and punishment. The managers failed to acknowledge and provide for the need of newly diverse discourse communities in this workplace to negotiate a new order in which sufficient shared meaning and agreed-upon language and behaviors could be constructed. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

It describes a model, or methodological framework, for crisis analysis as well as for organizational learning aimed at crisis management and prevention. The model is based on the interrelational positioning of the relevant agents (project managers, project team members, and stakeholders), the discourses produced by these agents, and their actions. This model is valuable for understanding the situations, goals, motivations, and anxieties that underlie the risk assessment and actions taken during crises.

Jihadist tactical technical communication persuades individuals to act by creating identification between individuals and audiences, and by associating terrorist tactics with everyday practices such as cooking. © 2017 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Business and technical writing grows out of a need to “build bridges” between ourselves and others. With today's diversifying readerships and increasingly global marketplace, business and industry face a new challenge that is reshaping our conception of business/technical writing and the metaphors of the genre. The metaphors of “selling” and “reader-centeredness” demand especially to be recast and subordinated to a new metaphor of interculturalism/ internationalism—“ourselves among others.” Grounded in a social theory of language and communication, this new metaphor signifies that “bridge-building” across differences will be the key in contexts becoming at once more heterogeneous and global. © 1992, (publisher).

As early as the Gorgias dialogue and as recently as a proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration, one finds those who argue that even the skills of technical and scientific communication are, in effect, artful forms of misrepresentation. These critics indict not only those who sell and apologize—easy targets—but also those whose avowed purpose is merely to make messages clearer. Can it be true that all forms of communication skill, even those that enhance clarity and precision, are merely elegant forms of lying? Does the word rhetoric deserve its tainted historical connotation? Or, even worse, is writing itself an inherently self-serving (that is, misleading) way of adapting to one's environment. © 1995 IEEE.""The article investigates the characteristics of ""dunning"" letters. Dunning letters are divided into three categories: apologetic, vituperative, and businesslike. Apologetic letters are reluctant to ask for repayment and offer excuses for doing so. They generally imply that the debtor is doing the creditor a favor by repaying the debt. Vituperative lettersrehearse the debtor's failings, the unpaid debt being just one. Businesslike letters range from mild to harsh letters with threat of legal action. These lettersare considerably shorter than apologetic and vituperative letters.""Media choice is an important topic in the field of organizational communication. With a plethora of media choices (e.g., letter, e-mail, voice mail, telephone, face-to-face meetings), the question of how and why individuals choose which mediumto use in what situation takes on additional importance. This concern is also shared in professional communication. I present a summary of a paper (Kinney and Watson) that tests the applicability of a prominent theory of media choice, media richness theory (MRT), to both traditional and new electronic forms of communication. I summarize the findings and present some implications for professional communication.""Pedagogy and research in intercultural and international communication depend on an understanding of a framework of concepts: (a) the instability and ambiguity of cross-cultural signifiers, (b) culture as a changing construct, (c) culture as a plurality and mixture of cultures, and (d) cross-cultural communication as dialogic. We need to revise our notion of culture as acquisition, our transmission model of communication, and our pedagogy of presenting tips and fostering stereotypes about “foreign” peoples and places. We need to begin with concepts of intercultural/international communication and a discussion of faulty approaches and appraisals that engender miscommunication before taking a narrow focus on dos and don'ts in our exchanges with others. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Assertiveness, cooperativeness, and group satisfaction were found to predict the grade given to the leader. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.""Composition and rhetoric's attention to writing as cultural performance is expanded to analyze writing as organizational performance. A Foucauldian understanding of discourse enables the diagnosis of a technical writer's annual performance appraisal as grounded in 20th-century Taylorized management principles.

When he returned victorious to Rome in BCE 29, Augustus embarked on a project to rebuild Rome with the splendor its new imperial status demanded. Despite the tranquility and prosperity enjoyed by most Romans during the Early Empire, many also felt a sense of loss. Much had changed in their social order at the end of the Republic. The nobility and the lower classes began to share more interests and Roman society took on a more egalitarian and commercial nature. Under Emperor Augustus, the function of rhetoric was stripped from legislative arenas and confined mainly to legal courts and ceremonial competitions. In the spirit of renewed patriotism and pragmatism, principles of rhetoric were also applied to writing about technical subjects, such as engineering and architecture. Both Vitruvius and Cicero used his writing to persuade Roman citizens to reclaim their heritage: of building arts in Vitruvius' case; of philosophy and meaningful public oratory in Cicero's case. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""In an effort to expand the range of ways graduate programs prepare students to be scholars and practitioners in technical and professional communication, this article argues for a fresh direct reengagement with stories, storytelling, and narrative as valuable ways of studying and effectively producing the varied texts of the workplace. The previous call for acknowledging the value of narrative traces back almost 30 years, and story is still being used in a variety of compelling ways, even as an overt regard for narrative has not been sustained.What may be lacking is a systematic way to transform assumptions about stories as informal anecdotes into stories as data for rigorous analysis. David Boje's antenarrative theory and method offers technical and professional communication graduate students, scholars, and practitioners just such a compelling and timely position from which to consider workplace processes and products. © The Author(s) 2017.""Few technical writers and editors understand the roles and importance of conjunctions. In fact, many find it hard to distinguish between otherwise and alternatively, between while and whereas, and between however and hence - imprecisions that too often lead to unclear writing or even technical inaccuracies. This paper uses a practical linguistic approach to describe word types that couple sentence patterns: those that subordinate a clause to the main part of a sentence pattern; those that conjoin clauses, phrases, or words; and those that connect clauses together. A ″Table of Couplers″ groups the main conjunctions into sub-sets according to meaning, thus allowing comparison and easy selection of the most appropriate word.""Engineering managers and supervisors who have to edit reports written by other engineers often feel uncomfortable because English is not their area of particular competence. They can ease their editing burden - and, coincidentally, their engineers' writing task - if they set clear guidelines before writing begins. The most important is identifying the reader. Others are: identifying the purpose; deciding on writing style and method of presentation; and establishing a writing/editing schedule. If managers then approach the editing task prudently, so that rather than arbitrarily changing words themselves they encourage their engineer-writers to make revisions, they will quickly establish good writer/editor rapport. More - they will discover that their editing role is really a training function. Their aim as managers should be to train their engineers to become better report writers who require less and less editorial supervision.""For the purpose of continually improving an English teacher training program, an attempt was made to research the expected competencies of reading instructors in relation to technical report writers. Interviews were conducted with those involved in the teaching of technical report writing. The interviews reflected very little familiarity with reading instruction at the college level. The results were coupled with current research findings on training and duties of college reading instructors. This suggested a possible strategy for improving services to technical report writing students.""Using a move-strategy genre analysis of 180 video game user reviews posted to six websites, this article describes typical characteristics of the genre as well as significant variations in genre construction. By creating new audiences and purposes for the genre, emerging genre variants have opened critical debates within the user community about genre change. Ultimately, the author argues that tracing genre variations could have implications for how technical communication scholars and practitioners support the needs and goals of user-generated genres. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""This article suggests a perspective on rhetoric of technology as discursive exploitation of the margins of indeterminacy affecting the development of technologies and technical artifacts. It examines such margins by examining the development of an aircraft auxiliary engine in a California aerospace company, focusing especially on how engines are tested. It examines technical documents associated with testing as arenas for rhetorical transactions involving various factors and interests vested in a technology and as residua of compliance and negotiation. It suggests that margins of indeterminacy in technology development provide critical rhetorical spaces for agency and decision making, spaces that engineers and technical communicators must be trained to appreciate and exploit appropriately.""This article proposes the use of a four-component multimodal employment project that offers students a 360-degree understanding of the rhetorical situations surrounding job searches. More specifically, we argue for the use of the four deliverables of written resumes and cover letters, mock oral onsite interview, video resume analysis, and peer critique of social media profiles in a widely taught employment project to help students better analyze the complicated rhetorical situations surrounding job applications and to facilitate better peer collaboration and serious revision of the two high-stakes documents of cover letters and resumes. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication."Presents an overview of this special edition Suggests virtual worlds are a new tool for technical communicators to accomplish traditional goals Presents questions that accompany this new medium."Researchers, including students, must accommodate to the mutating character of hyperlinks on the World Wide Web. A small study of citations in three volumes of BCQ demonstrates the phenomenon of “URL rot,” the disappearance of sites cited in the sample articles. Digital technology itself is now being used to create pockets of permanence, but with the understanding that preservation of content is only one ingredient in the mix of media and format migration. Databases like JSTOR offer digitally preserved copies of many scholarly journals. Online journals and search engines may offer their own archives. In general, researchers should cite digital articles in databases where possible and consider avoiding references to online journals with print editions. © 2003, Sage Publications.

Quantitative analysis of data found evidence for a positive relationship between participation in service learning and technical writing learning outcomes. Additionally, qualitative analysis suggests that service learning in online technical writing courses helps students to make connections to the ""real world,"" encourages students to connect with their audience(s) and develop a sense of purpose for writing tasks, connects students to future employment, and develops deep learning with course materials. It is hypothesized that these factors support the development of learning outcomes in distance education students. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Findings from a previous study indicate that dominance was a key inhibitor of creativity in virtual teams. This study extends understanding of dominance through an in-depth, qualitative analysis of eight virtual teams. Two research questions are addressed: (1) how is dominance manifested in virtual teams? and (2) why does dominance occur in some teams, and not others? Findings indicate that dominance occurred in three different patterns. Although both males and females dominated, a commonality across patterns was that the dominant individual belonged to the majority sex in each team. Furthermore, dominance was driven by a combination of a few team member status traits. When one or more status markers belonged to a single person - the dominant member - and were absent in other team members, dominance was pronounced. In teams that did not experience dominance, these status indicators were spread across multiple members. Additionally, even though all teams communicated strictly via asynchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC), equalization was not evidenced in the majority of teams. Status characteristics theory and proportional representation theory provide a basis to explain the prevalence, as well as the absence, of dominance in these virtual teams. © 2007 IEEE.""Previous models of communications are discussed, and a new model of communications is presented. The new model views the communications process as composed of separate steps or functions performed by the participants in the process. The dynamic nature of the communication process and the need to view the process as transcending space and time are discussed. The implications of this model are addressed and the model evaluated using criteria established by prior writers. © 1985, Sage Publications.

The first communications research studies were conducted during World War II due to the U.S. government's support of persuasive mass communications for servicemen; studies of the effects of psychological warfare and propaganda; and studies of efforts to sell war bonds and to gain civilian support for government rationing. The Hawthorne studies conducted by the Harvard Graduate School of Business in 1927 recognized informal communications and the grapevine as well as providing and led to the development of interviewing programs for employees."Dictamen, or the art of letter writing, became a distinct branch of study in medieval universities, particularly in Italy at the University of Bologna. The growing relations between the church and state, the rapid progress of the law, a growing commerce, and the complex interrela tions of the feudal society and the prelates required standards and models of prose composition. The present art of letter writing has been the logical result of the past and is founded in the traditional or liberal art of rhetoric. © 1979, Sage Publications.

For this project, students were asked to develop a communication tool with information about consent rates in organ donation to use in an academic medical center. In contrast to the service learning literature, which notes that students often resist the professionalizing move that service learning offers, this study shows that students in this project actually overprofessionalized, constituting themselves as one more party vying for control over the communication of organ donation. This embrace of professionalism via service learning raises as many issues as the resistance to professionalism that is more commonly documented.""This study examines the types of documents written by 23 executives/managers in two different companies—a col lection agency division of a large service company and a mid-sized professional liability insurance company.

A chan nel-ratio model of intercultural communication extends the application of the concept of high context/low context cultures and is configured so that it may accommodate the dynamics of a face-to-face interaction. Examples from intercultural focus groups and from the intercultural communication literature show the application of the model. The needs of business people in regard to simplicity, relevance, and completeness have been balanced in the construction of the model. The use of the model as a framework on which the student or business person can organize information is highlighted.

Step-by-step manuals have a one-on-one correspondence between picture and text (explanations and instructions), reflecting the action-reaction mode in which users tend to interact with computers. Guided tour manuals give users a visual impression of the program. The pictures, mostly full-screen captures, are annotated with several paragraphs of text. An experiment is reported in which we examined whether a visual manual helps users realize tasks faster and more accurately than a non-visual manual. No effects on accuracy were found, but the visual manual did increase the speed of task execution with a significant and substantial gain of 35 percent. The conclusion draws attention to the fact that there is no single best type of visual manual, but that each has its own strengths and weaknesses.""Practitioners of research in a particular field have extensive knowledge of how to operate successfully in that field and communicate effectively with others, within the boundaries of their own language and culture. However, when it comes to inducting novice researchers into these skills, difficulties are often encountered, and more so when the novice comes from a different language and cultural background. At the same time, specialists in English teaching or cross-cultural communication aiming to prepare novices to enter such a research environment often lack access to the details of how things are really done there. At The University of Adelaide, South Australia, this situation is being addressed through a new program for international postgraduate students in their first semester of enrolment. This Integrated Bridging Program (IBP) relies on collaboration between the discipline specialist researcher and language and learning specialists and is informed by the perspectives of systemic functional linguistics (SFL). This paper presents an overview of the IBP, followed by details of its operation in the Faculty of Engineering. Information is included on outcomes of the collaboration in specific instances, and how SFL theory has been applied to develop a flexible and effective induction which is highly valued by both staff and student participants. © 1996 IEEE.""While hundreds of books and articles are available that describe non verbal communication research, only a few are directly related to the business field.

This communication metamyth assumes that more communication is better, and is posited as a fundamental belief that organization processes such as the desire for greater participation ""map onto."" Results from the analysis of data from five different kinds of organizations revealed a general belief in this communication metamyth. Regardless of how much information organization members reported receiving, they wanted more. This study raises several issues that warrant further inquiry including our conceptualization of communication processes in organizations, methods of studying communication in organizations, and the role of researchers in perpetuating this communication metamyth. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""The point beyond which promotions, raises, and job opportunities in general are denied to women and minorities solely because of their sex or their race has been called the “glass ceiling.” This paper outlines a communication-based theory of the organizational glass ceiling.

Reports written under both conditions by 160 upper division college students in a business communication course were submitted to the Grammatik II program for quality analysis and the results were subsequently analyzed for significant differences using ANOVA. More similarities than differences were found as six of the ten tests did not show significant differences. The findings of the study do not support a general conclusion that basic writing quality will improve when documents are written by computer as compared to writing them by hand. The importance of the present findings as they relate to earlier research and future re search directions are discussed. © 1991, Sage Publications.

The text editing performance of twelve experts and 24 novices was studied across several benchmark tasks using either a command-driven, PC-based, or hard-wired text editing system. Experts were tested in the areas of performance (error-free performance and error proneness) and functionality; novices were tested in the area of learning. Additionally, the keystroke level model was applied to the performance tasks and the results compared to actual observations. The study indicated that the Roberts methodology could be easily applied to a work environment and provided useful information for the evaluation of text editing systems. Additionally, the study identified several areas of the keystroke level model which could be modified to provide a more accurate assessment of text editing performance. © 1989 IEEE""This study compares the résumé content preferences of Fortune 500 personnel ad ministrators and business communication instructors. There is also a comparison of the current personnel administrators' résumé content preferences to earlier research findings. Business communication instructor résumé content preference rankings were very similar to the current Fortune 500 personnel administrator rankings. There was agree ment on the relative importance of 60 of the 70 potential résumé content items. Statisti cally significant differences in rankings were found on 10 of the 70 items. For example, personnel administrators ranked job objective, grade point average, and reasons for leaving jobs significantly higher in importance than did the business communication instructors. The findings show a shifting in personnel administrators'preferences. They now want less personal information and more evidences of achievement and accomplish ments in college and on the job. © 1989, Sage Publications.

Asians are classified as high-context communicators and speak English in intercultural communication. Nevertheless, the relationship of language and culture on communication behaviors has remained unclear. To address this gap in the research, this study compares the communication behaviors of business professionals from two prominent Asian cultures-Japanese and Hong Kong Chinese-when these professionals participate in intercultural and intracultural decision-making meetings. The study reveals some differences in communication behaviors between the two cultural groups in both the intracultural and the intercultural meetings. Although both groups generally reflected their high-context communication orientations, they exhibited some deviations from the general discourse patterns, especially in the ways in which they expressed disagreements. © The Author(s) 2013.""This study compares the top six journals selected in an earlier survey of Association for Business Communication members as the top journals in which to publish for professional advancement. Those journals include Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Business and Technical Communication, Journal of Business Communication, and Management Communication Quarterly. Using variables found in other disciplines' journal assessment articles, comparisons were made with the following: length of articles published, disciplines of authors, statistical methodology included, major discipline of article focus, number of references included, and research methods used with sample size where appropriate. The analysis indicated significant differences among many of these journals. In selecting where to publish BMOC (business, management, organizational communication) articles, prospective authors in the area will find the information on these six journals informative and beneficial. © 2012 Association for Business Communication.""In their study of 261 students enrolled in eight sections of a business communication course, three taught in a traditional classroom setting and the others delivered in a hybrid, half-time online format, the authors found that all students measurably improved their writing skills. On another dimension of interest, however, students in the online hybrid course demonstrated a higher rate of active learning practices in their use of Blackboard course management software. Perhaps most important, online writing instruction yielded as significant levels of measurable improvement in writing as did instruction in a traditional classroom, provided that instructional materials corresponded to the particular needs of the students. These results are encouraging in indicating that online courses may provide the best form of course delivery for certain students and certain communication practices. © 2004, Sage Publications.

More recently, they have stressed the need for evaluative tools that account for situational expectations and constraints. Drawing from the literature on organizational and managerial effectiveness, we constructed an empirical model applicable to presentational communication. Over 100 communication professors evaluated the relevance of descriptors for six different types of business presentations: three oral and three written. Their judgments were used to create similarity scores, which were submitted to multidimensional scaling. A three-dimensional model emerged. This “competing values model” illustrates the dynamic interplay between the highly contrasting characteristics of four general types of presentational communication: relational, informational, instructional, and transformational. In conclusion, we discuss the benefits of the model and suggest its usefulness as an evaluative tool, particularly for the training of managers. © 1991, Sage Publications.

We think, however, that we can learn from the previous models to build a multipurpose computer writing environment that will take into account the needs of the professional writers as well as those of the students learning to write. We will begin by looking at some models of writing proposed by Hayes and Flower in 1980 and also at the model of White and ArndL Afterwards, we will review the model of professional writers developed by Clerc and link it with the previous models. We will then have to look at some computer writing environments described in the literature and see how these environments take into account the process and tasks identified in writing. Finally, we will suggest our model. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This paper discusses applying computer networks to cooperative distance learning for technical communication education. It first outlines applications of communication technologies employed in distance learning, and describes the design strategies of the applications. The paper's main focus is on the CORAL (Cooperative Remotely Accessible Learning) system for promoting cooperative distance learning currently under development in Taiwan. The CORAL system is a collective and collaborative project intended to integrate four major components in concept and construction: an interactive learning environment, educational foundations and implications, domain knowledge, and research efforts. One of the CORAL system's goals is to aid science and engineering students in learning communication technology courseware. The CORAL development process, including its design approach, structure, courseware, and evaluation, is reported. Research issues are also addressed. © 1996 IEEE.""This paper develops a conceptual framework for exploring significant differences in how people from diverse cultural backgrounds and with diverse individual characteristics might perceive and use web documents. This is the first stage of a large multistage empirical study of user satisfaction and effectiveness of various web designs based on cultural and individual factors. We identify six cultural factors and six individual factors that could impact the effectiveness of web documents. The six cultural factors include: power distance, individualism versus collectivism, masculinity versus feminity, anxiety avoidance, long-term versus short-term orientation, and polychronic versus monochronic time orientation. The six individual factors include: demographics (age and gender), professional knowledge, information technology knowledge, flexibility, information processing abilities, and cultural knowledge. Based on the conceptual model proposed in this paper, we develop a number of testable, specific propositions on how web document effectiveness could be impacted by the cultural and individual factors in various web designs. In order to measure document effectiveness of each design, we identify components of web document effectiveness as perceived usability, reliability, clarity, and comprehension that, in turn, influence readers' overall satisfaction with web documents. Using the propositions presented here, one can measure and analyze how cultural and individual factors influence users' satisfaction, which will assist researchers, educators, and communicators working with various web designs.""Here is a scheme for organizing truisms about the forms of communication and their interrelationships in time and space.

Students had the options of working with engineering-related software or choosing a theoretical topic for an undergraduate English language project. Method: This practitioner case-study research is based on a mixed-methods approach. Students were asked to complete a quantitative evaluation survey, which was complemented by an analysis of students’ project reports, presentations and the teacher’s supervision log. The final reports functioned as both an assignment for marking and an evaluation of the project results. Results: In total, 14 out of 20 students returned an evaluation survey sheet. Based on the mean group rankings of statements on a five-point Likert scale (0 to 4 points), the results showed that students perceived several objectives as greatly achieved: expanding subject-specific vocabulary (3.35), working with scientific literature (3.21), following a given template for writing scientific texts (3.21), and practicing techniques of literature search (3.07). Furthermore, students found it very important that they could exercise autonomy during the project phase (3.78) and had been allowed free choice of the project topic (3.64). The five project groups submitted reports of generally good linguistic quality on different aeronautical subject areas. Conclusion: As it may be concluded from the questionnaire responses, students favored language learning through collaborative constructionist project activity and learner autonomy. A didactic framework that promotes these elements seems to be well suited for similar technical learning environments, although no direct generalizations can be made from this small-scale case study.""This research examines students' reactions to a contemporary simulation infused in the business communication curriculum. Results show that students indicated the experience helped them learn how to work better as a team, how to maintain composure, how the business world works, and how to improve their communication. Students also verified the validity of the simulation, stating that it prepared them for the business world by providing them with a challenging yet positive experience to demonstrate learned business communication principles. Details about the pedagogical framework of the business communication simulation and possible explanations and implications behind the findings are discussed. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study provides an exploratory content analysis of business continuity planning (BCP) literature. The researchers systematically sampled multiple databases and codified artifacts using a set of variables developed by the research team. Based on the analysis, arguments are presented concerning the nature of BCP, the state of the BCP literature, and the nature of the conversations taking place in regard to BCP among academics, government/legal institutions, the media, and trade industries. Finally, the researchers demonstrate gaps in the current knowledge on BCP and suggest future directions for applied and theoretical research. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study analyzes the first thirteen volumes of this journal to deter mine research trends and methodologies discussed in the articles.

If we invite students to analyze these models for specific textual features, we teach them methods of formalist evaluation, but we fail to teach them ways in which they can learn to analyze and respond to specific contexts, see the subtle ways in which texts are inflected with many voices, and actively participate in the cultural conversation of the business community. This article moves from a critique of conventions to theories of context and intertext; these theories are applied to case studies of both professional and student business writing practices to analyze how rhetorical exchanges shape conventions and communication. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

This project was undertaken to determine whether such inconsistencies between the studies were due to methodological issues or to the lack of a multidimensional approach—one that recognizes important contingencies in the organizational context. This investigation examines the impact of direction and occupation on communication skill importance for entry-level positions in finance, management, engineering, and law. The results substantiate a three-dimensional model, based on direction, occupation, and position, for the examination and application of communication skill importance in organizations. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Taking the case of leadership as an example, this article demonstrates how CA can provide a fine-grained analysis of talk-in-interaction during a business meeting, which reveals an emic perspective on ""what is going on."" By linking such an analysis to wider social theorizing, notably a social constructivist approach to leadership and the construction of reality, CA is able to make explicit the normally ""seen but unnoticed"" machinery of talk with which leadership is enacted. Moreover, the results of such an analysis can give researchers a clearer insight into the phenomenon and help practitioners improve leadership and communication skills. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communication.""How well do you understand copyright law? How about the doctrine of fair use? If a recent study reported in the Business Communication Quarterly is any indication, IEEE members may not have a very solid understanding of either. J.V. Arn, R. Gatlin, and W. Kordsmeier reported the results of a questionnaire survey of the membership of the Association for Business Communication (ABC) (see Bus. Commun. Quart., vol.61, no.4, p.32-9, 1998). The survey was designed to test the understanding of ABC members of various parts of copyright law including the sections cited in the fair use guidelines for educational multimedia. In their brief description of fair use, the authors explain: ""fair use is a possible defense to copyright infringement in an educational or nonprofit environment but not in a commercial application"" (p. 36). This difference has long been recognized in differing fees for use. Nonprofit institutions who publish newsletters, monographs, and books routinely pay nominal fees to use copyrighted materials, but what about more limited uses such as in the classroom or in a presentation at a professional meeting? Defining multimedia as ""a single, computer-controlled product that integrates text, audio, graphic, still image, and moving pictures"", J.V. Arn et al., note that such a ""variety of sources requires the producer to understand a wide variety of legal constraints"" (p. 33). Their study showed that ABC members often underestimated their rights to use copyrighted material.""This genre-based study comprises a comparative content analysis of textual and pictorial themes in a corpus of Dutch-English and British managerial forewords. It indicates that there are significant thematic differences between the Dutch-English CEO's statements, the British CEO's statements, and the British Chairman's statements and that these may be attributable to communicative and historical conventions as well as to current affairs in a particular business community. The present analysis, therefore, suggests that these managerial forewords cannot be considered as identical texts, although all are part of the same comprehensive document (i.e., the annual report). As such, this study suggests that text analysts, instructors, and practitioners in intercultural communication should be sensitive to both textual and contextual features for a full understanding of professional texts in intercultural discourse situations. © 2006 IEEE.""Corpus studies are revolutionizing the study of language practice, including professional communication, by substituting actual examples of practice for prescriptive intuition. Corpora are often put together by researchers who exert much care in what goes into a corpus. Yet professional communicators also experience corpora as commodities in the marketplace, bundles of ""writing models"" for sale that cross genres of professional and personal communication. When writers purchase these bundles, what are the latent rhetorical strategies they are purchasing? A corpus study of 728 canned letters across 15 genres taken from a best-selling trade book was undertaken. The texts were tagged for rhetorical features and factor analyzed for latent rhetorical dimensions of proficiency. The study concludes that the latent rhetorical proficiencies brought into evidence are heavily weighted on skills of collecting or raising money. While this study requires replication over a wider sample, it illustrates how corpus approaches can help us rigorously retrieve latent rhetorical skills across a collection of rhetorically diverse texts. It further helps us see how corpus studies allow one to maintain close ties between the avowed standards of communication practice and the close description of the practices themselves. © 2006 IEEE.""The six most significant books and monographs published on editing within the past five years (1985-1990) are reviewed. These books are useful for engineers, scientists, professional writers, and other technical communicators who do their own writing.

Crisis communication literature tends to focars on what to do before and after a crisis and on the kinds of crises corporations face. Less attention is given to the options available within mes sages about a crisis. The theory of image restoration provides a useful key to composing such messages. This article applies the theory to one case study in image repair discourse: USAir's response to media coverage of the crash of one of its aircraft in Pittsburgh in 1994. Introducing such case studies in the classroom helps students to understand the basic tenets of persausion in the highly charged context of repairing a corporate reputation after an attack. © 1997, Sage Publications.

Despite these factors, however, many teachers in the business and technical writing classrooms are unsure of why they should internationalize their curriculum, or what methods to use to ensure that students benefit from such a curriculum. This critical bibliography provides a practical resource for teachers of business and technical writing who wish to internationalize their curriculum. The bibliography is divided into sections to provide practitioners with resources discussing the rationale for internationalization to specific assignments they may consider using in their classroom.""Edward Hall's model of low-context and high-context cultures is one of the dominant theoretical frameworks for interpreting intercultural communication. This article reports a meta-analysis of 224 articles in business and technical communication journals between 1990 and 2006 and addresses two primary issues: (a) the degree to which contexting is embedded in intercultural communication theory and (b) the degree to which the contexting model has been empirically validated. Contexting is the most cited theoretical framework in articles about intercultural communication in business and technical communication journals and in intercultural communication textbooks. An extensive set of contexting propositions has emerged in the literature; however, few of these propositions have been examined empirically. Furthermore, those propositions tested most frequently have failed to support many contexting propositions, particularly those related to directness. This article provides several recommendations for those researchers who seek to address this popular and appealing yet unsubstantiated and underdeveloped communication theory. © 2008 Sage Publications.""Compares graphics from Chinese and American science magazines and manuals  Finds that the Chinese visuals provide more contextual and technical information, while the American visuals are more closely integrated with verbal explanations.""This study examined the generalizability of the theory of exit, voice, loyalty and neglect to Koreans (n=100), and made multiple cross-cultural comparisons between Korean respondents and natives of the United States (n=80) and Japan (n=45) with respect to their communicative responses to dissatisfying work conditions. Findings supported the applicability of the theory to Korean workers. In addition, cross-cultural comparisons indicated more similarities between the responses of natives of the United States and Korea than between those of the Japanese and Koreans, thus bringing into question the notion that because East Asian countries share elements of a common sociocultural heritage the communication behaviors of workers in these countries will be the same. © 1992, Sage Publications.

This article describes a two-part strategy to help with this aspect of a usability study. The first part of the strategy is to investigate the questions the product team has about its product and turn these questions into well-defined usability questions. The second part is to take those usability questions and develop a data crosswalk, a framework that gives you a systematic way to decide what specific evidence you need to answer the test questions, and what data you need to collect to get that evidence. © 1994 IEEE.""The article compares perceptions regarding business communication, stating that business school alumni and business managers count communications courses among those that were most useful in learning business skills, while current students and faculty both rate those same courses as the least important. The author states that there are two reasons for this difference, first being that students have a difficult time relating their communications studies with real-life situations, and second, because communication skills need to be learned through memorizing rules and participating in drills. The author also discusses how communications faculty can improve their status and teaching methods.""Over a period of 10 years, we have developed a sustainable process of online portfolio assessment that demonstrates both reliability and validity, using both qualitative and quantitative measures. The sustainable cycle is that, each semester, we assess a random sampling of the students' work that they have posted, as per our instructions, in an online portfolio. During the reading, the faculty score the documents for 11 variables, including writing, content, audience awareness, and document design. We achieved validity by a modified online Delphi that led to a redefinition of the construct of technical communication itself; we achieved reliability by adjudication resulting in adjacent scores. The results of our assessment meet the requirements of ABET and result in a continual cycle of improvement for our technical communication curriculum. Results from three semesters show an improving correlation between the course grade and the overall, holistic portfolio score.""To describe the specification, procurement, and implementation of a new, XML-based technical documentation system for a large, multinational company. Method: This study uses a descriptive analytical method, based on available project data, interviews, and fault analyses. Results: The results of this research outline the technical, strategic, and organizational aspects that are associated with the procurement of a critical multi-site system where a high level of availability is necessary. Conclusion: Organizational stakeholders were identified as critical for success; new authors’ previous experiences lacked predictive value; existing documentation cultures at one specific site were not studied closely enough; and a deeper analysis of risk management with regard to the choice of DTD should have been made. © 2016.

The studies of investor relations from a strategic communication standpoint are almost nonexistent in the United States. At the same time, investor relations today is undergoing a major shift from financial reporting to building and maintaining relationships with shareholders. The article reviews literature to define the current body of knowledge and state of research in investor relations. Then, the article reports on a survey of Fortune 500 companies to identify major investor relations practices at corporations: investor relations activities, their target audiences, their place in organizational structure, the education of investor relations officers, and what problems investor relations officers face. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the use of the Black communication style by African Americans in an organized environment. The research method which was used involved a multimethod approach of data collection in the field using direct observation, and obtrusive observations, as well as semi-structured interviews. This investigation has shown that although the Black employees in this organization felt, in general, as if they were changing their communication style to fit the organizational norms, they continued to rely on the cultural norms underlying the Black communication style. U.S. demographics are foretelling a future that will require innovative organizational communication strategies. According to Fine, two facts about the U.S. corporate environment which are uncovered by demographic trends are that the workforce will be comprised of a ""greater diversity of gender, race, age, culture, and language"" and that the demand for qualified workers will exceed the supply thereby ""creating intense competition among organizations for workers"" [1]. These changing demographics are not going unnoticed by the U.S. corporate leaders. Specifically, the issues of most concern to organizational executives, according to Workforce 2000, center around linguistic and cultural differences. Most organizations have no innovative strategies for meeting the demands of a diverse workforce. Traditional programs, such as day-care provisions, flexible work times, and hiring and recruiting more people of color are being implemented by corporate America in an effort to meet the demand for diversity. However, organizations are often lacking in creative programs which will provide for this emerging diverse workforce an environment that will accept and nurture their diversity. Certainly these corporate executives are receiving little in the way of guidance from organizational researchers.""The purpose of the study was to fill gaps in our knowledge about technical editors' work practices and perceptions, knowledge that might be useful for teachers and practitioners, as well as current and prospective students. Research questions: (1) What work activities do technical editors engage in? (2) How do people become and progress in careers as technical editors? (3) What do technical editors perceive about the complexity of their work and its value to themselves and others? Literature review: The literature review focuses on previous surveys of technical editors, which have tended to focus on technology-related issues and been largely limited to samples obtained from the Society for Technical Communication. Methodology: A link to an online survey was sent to 32 professional organizations for technical and other professional, nonliterary, and nonjournalism editors. The leadership of each organization was asked to forward the link to its members; 12 complied, with a resulting 253 respondents. Responses to closed-ended questions were tabulated, while responses to the open-ended questions were analyzed thematically. Results and conclusions: The results revealed a broad range of job titles, disciplinary and professional fields, genres and media, editing-related tasks, and extent and type of collaboration. Respondents perceived as useful several forms of academic preparation, personality traits, and attitudes. About half the respondents had become editors through deliberate preparation during college (direct route) and half had not (indirect route). Thus, one implication of the results is that college students majoring in the sciences and other technical fields (indirect route) might be attracted to complementary minors and certificate programs in technical communication/editing. The sample was obtained from among a broader range of technical editors than samples used in previous surveys but was relatively small and, therefore, nongeneralizable. Future surveys should strive for a larger sample size and include questions about a wide range of demographic variables that can be correlated with the independent variables. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Technical writing programs housed in geographically isolated universities face great challenges in regard to getting students career-related work experience. A course in desktop publishing can provide students at rural schools with experience equivalent to internships. In the desktop publishing course I taught at Murray State University, in addition to learning principles of layout and design, students faced many challenges like those that will confront them in the workplace. They worked on projects that entailed real financial constraints and deadlines; they were required to modify their work after receiving reviews from several different individuals. In addition to providing students with experience, the course provided benefits to the university in terms of services and public relations. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A theory of correspondence as a form of dialogue can, however, be constructed with the help of two very different scholars, Erasmus and Bakhtin. Erasmus, the Renaissance humanist, offers a pragmatic guide to the practice of dialogue in correspondence, and Bakhtin, the twentieth-century Russian philosopher of language, provides theoretical concepts that define the nature of dialogical communication. The present article combines the ideas of both scholars into a unified theory of business correspondence and then presents both a set of guidelines and a model for the practice of dialogical correspondence. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

To address business problems in a timely way, virtual teams must quickly become effective upon formation. However, prior studies have found that virtual teams are ineffective initially because electronic communication does not facilitate building of shared understanding among team members. This study proposes a dialogue technique that facilitates building of shared understanding in virtual teams. Results from an experiment showed that virtual teams which used this technique had better relational development and decision outcome than those which did not. Moreover, these differences remained over time. Therefore, the dialogue technique appears to be useful for helping virtual teams become effective quickly so as to address business problems without unnecessary delays. © 2000 IEEE.""Organizations such as universities and corporations are increasingly using electronic text media such as electronic mail and conferencing systems to communicate with associates. However, technical communicators currently have no rhetorical strategies to deal with these new and unfamiliar media; they must generate new strategies to communicate and persuade through electronic text. This paper discusses the characteristics of electronic text that call for new rhetorical strategies, examines how users function rhetorically in the new media, and outlines several strategies that technical communicators can use when communicating through electronic text. © 1994 IEEE""To discover the similarities and differences between primary and secondary computer manuals, and to account for the popularity of the secondary texts, we compared two best-selling books for word processing and spreadsheet programs to documentation supplied by the manufacturer. We began the study by developing a heuristic for analyzing software documentation based on cognitive and rhetorical principles. We then applied the heuristic to the corporate documentation for WordPerfect 5.0 in contrast to Stewart’s Using WordPerfect 5 from Que, and the corporate documentation from Lotus 1-2-3 in contrast to Gilbert and Williams’ The ABC's of 1-2-3 from Sybex. Although the four sets of texts were comparable when analyzed according to psychological factors for effective documentation, they differed when analyzed according to rhetorical factors. All the texts integrate factors designed to support learning. They use techniques that encourage short- and long-term memory, invoke existing work schemas, build new schemas, and make text processing easier. However, the trade texts from Que and Sybex contain more conceptual background information, and they differ in their rhetorical stance: the writers provide a richer context by giving more examples for applying the software; the writers provide global and structural frameworks; the writers use persuasive marketing techniques to ease the reader’s anxieties and remind them of the software’s benefits; and the writers identify themselves. These differences have the common effect of creating a stronger bond between writer and reader. © 1992 IEEE""Two primary job-getting processes are interviewing and résumé preparation; yet much of what is written about these two procedures is speculation rather than fact. This article examines two major questions. Are there differences in how recruiters and students view the interviewing process?And, how do subtle visual changes to a résumé, such as typewriter face and paper color, affect recruiters? Attached to this research is another major question Beyond a student's major, what abilities do recruiters find most valuable? Responses to these questions are determined through questionnaires to professional recruiters and to students. © 1984, Sage Publications.

Taking a social constructionist approach to leadership and using discursive constructionism as a research methodology to analyze transcripts of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction, this article explicates the doing of leadership as a member's accomplishment. It defines leadership in terms of being able to influence the management of meaning through the way in which decisions are framed using assessments. In this way, certain meanings are privileged over others and so meaning is managed. Findings support current theories of leadership that show it to be a distributed process rather than the possession of any one person. Furthermore, it is argued that by highlighting discursive techniques by which leadership is achieved, the results of this research can benefit practitioners. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""Evaluation of a document's usability can be done at many times during the document's development cycle, and it can have many purposes.

Technical communication as a discipline has taken some advantage of the movement or its derivative software, but this article argues not as much as it could or should. We have adopted Open Source Software (OSS) to manage courses or websites; we have, following the principles of Open Source, made some intellectual resources available; but we have not developed a truly open-open to access, open to use, and open to edit-pedagogical resource that teachers of technical and professional communication courses at every level can rely on to craft free offerings to their students. Now is the ideal time to consider developing OpenTechComm. This article makes the case for why and how it could be implemented.""This study examined the most frequently encountered barriers that may affect listening effectiveness among business college students. A factor analysis indicated the presence of six listening barrier factors that concern students. In addition, the barrier “listen primarily for details or facts” was perceived to be the most frequently en countered barrier identifded by the students. The students’ major or age had no bearing on the level of frequency given to the barrier factors. However, two out of the six factors were significantly different based on the students'sex. © 1990, Sage Publications.

The present study explores the evolution of genre of resume writing in China using a grounded theory approach. This study examines the rhetorical patterns and persuasive strategies employed in resume writing in different periods in China and reveals how these changes are related to historical, social, and economic contexts in China, especially from 1979 to 2010, as well as impacts of global contexts on Chinese resume writing. This study characterizes resume writing in China and relates these features to cultural motives and cultural contexts. It concludes that current resume writing practice in China shows a glocal trend. © 2011 IEEE.""This article describes the development of a communication course for graduate business students that recognizes the emergence of global commerce using high-technology communication, while not ignoring fundamental skills.

Nike court case. This groundbreaking case merits further examination and, informed by Gramsci's notion of hegemony, reveals the underlying ideological struggle present in the Nike crisis: a struggle for voice, power, and free corporate speech. Activist voices opposing sweatshops, Nike's defenses, and eventually, the legal decisions of the U.S. court system constituted competing voices in these ideological struggles over what is acceptable or right corporate behavior. This hegemonic struggle influenced standards for international labor, public relations efforts that misrepresent facts, and consideration of corporate public relations as free or commercial speech. This hegemonic model of crisis communication, unlike previous theories, recognizes the dynamic struggle between voices with various levels of power and the important ideological implications resulting from competing voices in crisis communication. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""Instant Messaging (IM) features informal writing styles such as the omission of punctuation. Punctuation plays an important role in representing prosody and facilitating syntactic processing during communication. The discrepancy between the recognized importance and actual inadequate usage of punctuation in IM calls for establishing punctuation convention for more effective online communication. The research uniquely reported here addressed two research questions. The first was whether punctuation had an impact on the effectiveness of IM. The results of an empirical study showed that the majority of surveyed participants perceived punctuation to be somewhat important. This led to the investigation of the second research question: how to restore omitted punctuation in instant messaging to help develop punctuation convention effectively? We designed and implemented a technical solution for recovering punctuation based on heuristics rules and an evaluation of this approach showed satisfactory performance. A detailed analysis of punctuation in archived instant messages revealed several patterns of omitted punctuation. The findings of this research not only advance our understanding of the stylistic convention, but also provide positive evidence for establishing punctuation convention in IM. As IM continues to pervade daily communication, punctuation convention in IM deserves closer attention. © 2005 IEEE.""We describe a model organization tree for the typical report expected of students in the strategy or policy course almost universally required in business programs, whether undergraduate or graduate.

When used heuristically, writing exercises encourage students to practice self-assessment, self-evaluation, active learning, and knowledge transfer, all while reinforcing the basics of good writing. Using writing exercises as a diagnostic or maintenance tool at different stages in the semester, in addition to the core assignments, can drastically improve undergraduate and graduate student writing and increase the probability that these students will transfer that writing knowledge into other courses and into their practices as professional writers in industry. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article investigates the ways in which a subset of technical communicators acquired electronic literacy from 1978 to 2000, a period during which personal computers became increasingly ubiquitous in the United States in educational settings, homes, communities, and workplaces. It describes the literacy autobiographies gathered from 55 professional communicators participating on the Techwr-l listserv, focusing on the large-scale trends that these autobiographies reveal. To supplement the findings from these autobiographies, the authors conducted face-to-face interviews with four case-study participants: a faculty member, a professional communicator, and two students of different backgrounds majoring in technical communication. The article concludes with observations about the development of technical communication instruction in the twenty-first century.""Since the 1950s, technical communicators have been trying to predict future developments in technology, economics, pedagogy, and workplace roles.

A historical approach to the question offers three important observations to designers: 1) that the impulse to anthropomorphicize technology has been longstanding and has been employed with artifacts other than computers; 2) that the normal evolution of technologies proceeds through an introductory phase during which a culture becomes acclimatized to the new technology; moreover, one of the methods by which cultures have traditionally become acclimatized to new technologies is through anthropomorphization; and 3) the perception of anthropomorphism in the human computer interface has been complicated by the fact that ""computers"" were, in fact, first people not machines. An historical approach to answering the interface design question posed by Microsoft's Bob interface suggests that designers productively accommodate the longstanding human impulse to anthropomorphicize new technologies.""To replicate the need for communication speed and effectiveness in the workplace, I have designed a successful business writing course based on a hybrid recursive model that combines prescriptive rhetorical patterns with a perceptive application of those patterns. The model draws inspiration from (a) current-traditional rhetoric, modified for a business context, to address the need to write quickly, which I label the ""prescriptive phase,"" and from (b) cognitive rhetoric, again modified for a business context, to address the need to write effectively, which I label the ""perceptive phase."" © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article reviews recent studies of legal discourse and nonacademic writing and presents the results of a historical case study of an environmental public policy. The author examined the rhetoric of public sector communication to show how an Indiana water quality standards administrative law was socially constructed as it was written collaboratively in two cycles by members of a text-centered legal discourse community. Key findings describe a dynamic discourse community with changing writing roles among government employees, lay members of the audience, and water pollution control board members. The social and political context surrounding this collaborative effort delayed formal adoption of the water quality standards in the public sector. Controversial provisions of the law stimulated social and political actions, including legislation, and in the process delayed rulemaking.""This article analyzes the effects of a transparency view of language that is implicit in some technical discourses. Using a legal concept, the excited utterance exception to hearsay, as an exemplary discourse, I show that this view of language is predicated on social norms rather than empirical standards. Indeed, I argue, the measurement of accuracy using an empirical standard creates a situation in which the speaker's rhetorical concerns and the context can be ignored. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""Professor Robert Hay rebuts the editorial judgment of John Alderson's research report in the Spring issue of the Journal and in his turn questions the editor's understanding of an effective letter.

Specifically, the paper includes a strategic model for making choices among persuasive options. According to the model, choices about communication messages and media are a function of the relative force (effectiveness, efficiency, and quality) o f the available options. A compari son of the strength of the given choices provides an assessment of relative force. The force o f a specific option, in turn, arises from the message sender's persuasive goals and receiver's probable response. © 1988, Sage Publications.

The gender implications of technology are studied in various ways across the disciplines of communications, gender studies, and technology and society. This study overviews and summarizes articles dealing with gender implications of the Internet in journals in these fields. The analysis identified 132 articles during the period of 1995-2003 in 28 publications in which frequencies, trends, and potential gaps were assessed using quantitative and qualitative meta-analysis. Most of the research in this area is being done in technology publications (59.7% of articles). Women's usage of the Internet is the most frequently studied level of participation. Results indicates that the survey method was the most predominant, but various qualitative methods are often employed. Notable themes included those of equal access yet unequal participation, the existence of both negative and positive aspects of the Internet, and the dichotomy of online/offline activities. The purpose of this study was to encourage interest in performing continued research on this topic as women's Internet access meets and exceeds that of men. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article provides a framework for organizing and structuring the research of historical researchers who analyze technical and scientific publications. Because historical research spans both decades and centuries, an effective research methodology is essential. The framework consists of a multifaceted 10-step method for studying the written discourse of scientific and technical communication, specifically for interpreting historical data obtained from articles published in technical and scientific journals. The method is a reliable means for making sense of the sense of the enormous body of data that awaits historical researchers in the volumes of scientific and technical discourse already published.""A reprint of the article from the December 1964 issue of the ""Journal of Communication"" is presented discussing a survey of bookson communication published during the period 1950-1959.

It supports courses in business and technical communication. The current version includes modules on press releases in English, business letters in French, and minute taking in Dutch. Unlike many online writing centers, it is genre-specific and context-specific, it is highly interactive rather than linear, it uses a process approach to cater to different learning styles, it accommodates different writer profiles, and it is an instructional tool not connected to a physical writing center. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""The primary goal of this study was to determine the quality of communication in organizations as assessed by a national sample of middle managers. A secondary goal was to compare one company's communication quality assessment data to the national survey findings. A questionnaire was mailed to 3,602 middle managers across the United States and to 36 managers in a small marketing organization. Frequency distributions, crosstabulations, and Chi-square tests were used to analyze the national data and to make comparisons with company data. The national sample of middle managers assessed the quality of communication in their organizations as quite poor. Over 62 percent of the respondents disagreed with the statement that the quality of the information they receive is good. In addition, the middle managers' best source of information was not the formal line organization hierarchy—both network communication and the grapevine were frequently ranked as better sources of information than was formal communication. © 1991, Sage Publications.

This article presents our methods and results and addresses the benefits and limitations of the Collaborative Prototype Design Process (CPDP), including ways in which this new method can be implemented. The CPDP is an innovative approach to user-centered website design that emphasizes collaboration, iterative testing, and data-driven design. The CPDP balances the power and needs of users with those of designers and, thus, enables design teams to test more tasks and involve more users. We divided our initial team into three independent design teams to separately profile users, test usability of low-fidelity paper prototypes, and then create and test usability of resulting wireframes. After completing the user-centered design and usability testing, the three teams merged to analyze their diverse findings and create a final prototype. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This work was based on a case study of a university institute designed to bring university and industry leaders together to promote research and economic development.

They suggest that the expressly pragmatic orientation of classical rhetoric suits it to the corporate setting; however, the ancient topical system as it appears in the classical sources is unwieldy for modern writers. The authors hone and reorganize this system to make it a tool which corporate speakers can use profitably. They then amplify their adaptation of the ancient system with questions, sample arguments drawn from the questions, and a case study showing how one speaker used their topical system to write a successful speech. © 1984, Sage Publications.

These theories tell us that one way to gain power is by demonstrating some type of expertise that is valued within the organization. This case study of an auditor who was an expert writer will demonstrate how her expertise led to changes within the organization. As a young woman at the lowest professional level in a male-dominated bureaucratic organization, she would not have been expected to gain power.

In the first one, four versions of a short popular science article were created: one without references and three with references-one incorporated references in running text, one in a separated text block at the end, and one between parentheses. The parentheses version was rated highest. In the second experiment, two versions of another popular science article were evaluated: one with references in parentheses and one with references in footnotes. This time, the footnote version was rated highest. We conclude that there is reason to doubt the received wisdom that common readers prefer omitting references or incorporating them in running text. Readers seem to favor the ancient and much-maligned mechanism of the footnote for providing background information.""The author presents a method for using C.S. Peirce's (1867) three conceptual categories to present a compact historical overview of major ethical theories to PEs (professional engineers) during professional ethics training seminars. The use of this method helps the seminar participant to easily grasp the ""big picture"" of ethical thought and to discover his or her own place within that picture. The benefit of this is that the participant is then more engaged when discussing codes of ethics and case studies.""When people read silently, they unconsciously translate what they read into a speech-like code that facilitates word identification and the creation of meaning. This article examines that phenomenon - known as silent speech - based upon the published research of cognitive psychologists and psycho-linguists. The author develops a phonological model of reading based upon published results of experimental investigators to determine the relationship between cognition and silent speech. The author then applies the model to technical communication. The applications include the use of punctuation, pronouns, and abbreviations, as well as introducing new words, writing to satisfy the speech instinct, cultivating a human voice, and revising technical documents.""We report the results of a pilot study that offers the field of technical and professional communication its first look at material working conditions of contingent faculty, such as course loads, compensation, and professional support. Findings include that contingent faculty are more enduring with stable full-time, multi-year contracts; they carry a substantial teaching loads; and the majority are satisfied and happy in their present position, but half would prefer to be working on the tenure track. © The Author(s) 2016.""Evaluating test results can be a frustrating and time-consuming task.

Amount/hind of detail depends on a review of the audience addressed and the purposes for com posing. Appropriate emphasis also depends on audience and purpose and involves considering location and amount of space given to content. Logical progression—the arrangement and cohesiveness of the writing— includes reviewing traditional patterns of order and use of transitions. Topic sentences predict the order of paragraphs; transitions provide inter nal links. Stylistic appropriateness involves rereading to suit sentence length, structure, and complexity; diction; voice and tone to the audience. Mechanical accuracy is an editing procedure. © 1983, Sage Publications.

A variety of models for writing classes have been proposed to meet these needs, from genre-based approaches to courses targeting specific disciplines to general courses serving a heterogeneous group of students from many disciplines. Although persuasive arguments can be made for discipline-specific writing courses, many writing courses for nonnative writers at U.S. universities operate with two key constraints. First, monetary and curricular limitations mean that students from a variety of disciplines are placed in the same course. Second, these courses are staffed by instructors who, while well-prepared in addressing language needs of nonnative writers, may know very little about the content and conventions of engineering and science. This paper discusses a writing course which works within these constraints and has been developed for graduate students who are early in their program of study. In the course, groups of students carry out an original research project as a vehicle to learn professional writing conventions common to research papers in a variety of scientific and engineering fields. In addition, students analyze written conventions in published articles within their fields to raise awareness of how general conventions are worked out in their individual disciplines. General principles for the course are discussed, and samples of successful research topics are provided.""The authors present the results of a number of studies which show the need for improving communication skills among university students.

Much like their typical paperback predecessors, these libraries purport to overcome the drudgery of preparing typical business correspondence. This study examines three library packages.

However, it takes so much time and effort to organize material manually and revise it until it is clear that many writers give up before producing a clearly written speech. Writing in a modified outline form on the word processor helps solve this problem. The outline form, coupled with the simplicity and speed of making changes on the word processor, makes it easy to respond as you write to the visual feedback of your writing, almost forcing you to express ideas in a well organized, simple, and clear manner. For many writers, the speed and ease of the word processor is the only thing that makes repeated revision possible. On the word processor, you can experiment repeatedly with the visual display of the text and keep revising until the display—and the text—reflects the best organization of the material and the natural cadences of the spoken word. The result is a speech that guarantees that the listener will understand the message and stay awake through the speech. © 1990 IEEE""Provides an effective method for checking the content-accuracy, completeness, and logical order of a document Notes that this technique is not a substitute for more careful review when time and the document's importance allow""Are the so-called stock phrases and stereotypes of business language really as bud as most writing teachers claim 1 Or do they indeed deserve a closer look!

The findings are useful for those wanting to know the state of homepage design in 2013, whether as current practitioners or researchers. Research questions: (1) What are the current homepage design practices of Fortune 500 companies? (2) What are the current Web 2.0 technology practices of Fortune 500 companies? (3) What changes in homepage design have occurred for Fortune 500 companies? (4) What are the differences in homepage design and Web 2.0 technology practices between the 100 largest and 100 smallest Fortune 500 companies? and (5) Is homogeneity in design increasing amongst Fortune 500 homepages? Literature review: Three key areas guided my analysis of homepages. (1) Usability research, which suggests guidelines for design based on aggregated performance of users, such as locating the search box in the upper right and for directing mobile users to an alternate site designed for mobile access. (2) Design practice studies, which suggest guidelines for design based on aggregated analyses of websites, such as having links to employment information and investor information on the homepage. (3) Design patterns: libraries of patterns to provide designers with responses to design problems, such as using collapsible panels or module tabs to reveal and conceal content on a page. These libraries also provide guidelines for design, such as using fat menus or sitemap footers to structure navigation. Methodology: Using content analysis, every Fortune 500 homepage in 2013 was analyzed for 68 major design elements in these categories--navigation, content links, support for specific types of users, visual design, multimedia, and web 2.0—and the results were analyzed. Results and conclusions: The homepages displayed greater homogeneity in design than a similar study in 2008. Overall, 12 elements—(1) corporate logo in the top left of the page; (2) link to an “about us” section containing company information; (3) link to information for those seeking employment; (4) horizontally oriented main navigation; (5) link for contacting the company; (6) link for information for investors; (7) link for terms of use or legal disclaimers; (8) link to privacy information; (9) link for news or a press room; (10) multimedia use; (11) links that do not appear on the page initially, requiring interaction; (12) search box, located in the upper right of page—were present on 80% or more homepages, and 6 elements—(1) web 2.0 features; (2) an image that can be clicked on as a focal point; (3) link to a sitemap; (4) link to Twitter; (5) link to Facebook; and (6) dropdown or pulldown menu—were present on 50% to 79% of pages. Between 2008 and 2013, many practices have changed, such as increases in page length, the overall number of links, the number of links to social media sites, and the number of sites with search boxes.

Although the results of such research cannot be generalized to different contexts, accounting narratives written in non-English languages have seldom been analyzed in this respect. More important, few studies have longitudinally examined the evolution in readability of such narratives. This study focuses on the readability evolution of annual report narratives written in Spanish, applying an adapted version of the Flesch readability formula to two sets of documents from different companies over most of the years of the 20th century. The results confirm that the reports are indeed difficult to read but show an improvement in readability over the years. The study tested several variables that might influence readability, including profitability. © The Author(s) 2015.""Mission and vision statements can be constructed as Unifying Action Declarations (UADs).

Because business communication spans a vast territory and because our teaching situates us in a variety of disciplines across the academy, each with its own research standards, research in our field has become a far-flung enterprise. The breadth of our research consortium, however, should not be seen as a liability, because the peer review process ensures the integrity of our imports, and as a discipline we benefit from the constant influx of fresh ideas. Although importing from other disciplines challenges us to translate for each other, we are uniquely qualified to solve this rhetorical problem because of the intrinsically pedagogical nature of business communication. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""Although difficult to assess, communication climate is a variable of much interest to researchers of organizational behavior.

Results of this synthesis include the following: Organizations use collaborative and traditional instruments to evaluate employees, training of raters is essential, multiple raters are more effective than single raters, interrater agreement is strong between peer and supervisory ratings, and performance feedback is positively correlated with ratee job satisfaction. By imposing Bolman and Deal's four-part organizational framework on performance-appraisal literature, it is possible to make recommendations for future research that are human-resource and political-symbolic oriented. Recommendations call for more studies that investigate counterrational dimensions in performance appraisal, interaction effects between rater and ratee characteristics, preferences of raters and ratees toward components in performance appraisal, and communication transactions within the framework of the performance appraisal. © 1995, Sage Publications.

The heuristic includes three interconnected models: self-contained, which leverages the features of fixed instructional content; embedded, which leverages the features of user-generated metadata; and open, which leverages the features of mutable instructional content. Although the models overlap to some extent, their distinctions help to illustrate the changing nature of online how-to discourse. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""The pressure-filled, highly competitive business environment of the 1990s means U.S. firms can no longer afford such costly inefficiencies as poor communication. lbday managers must carefully plan production runs, service deliveries, and precise scheduling of employees. Now another item--communication-must be added to this list. The prudent (and ultimately successful) manager must anticipate communication problems. The communication flow should be viewed from the same perspective as the flow of autos along the assembly line or hamburgers from the grill to the customer. This mind-set motivates the manager to design the message more effectively, to recognize when the message is or is not being correctly interpreted, and to be prepared to adapt the message to fit the situation. Whether you use a script or role play, we believe this approach is an engaging way to train students to evaluate their own communication skills so they can accurately identify their weaknesses. The knowledge they gain will then enable students to develop strategies for communicating effectively on time, every time, adjust in time, a vital ingredient in managerial success in the twenty-first century. © 1994, Sage Publications.

This inquiry leads to analyses of meaning in written or spoken utterances and their relationship to cognitive processes. Some communication models attempt to accommodate the fact that meanings are culturally based and therefore differ from culture to culture, but this paper proposes a model that shows how meanings are generated from the attributions by the perceiver as well as from knowledge of the actual culture. Individuals project mental schemata of unfamiliar cultures. Furthermore, as uncertainty is reduced by cognitive understanding, schemata can grow more to resemble the actual culture. But the induction of information does not always result in improved intercultural communication; an individual's attitudes and evaluations can become unaccepting, negatively evaluating, and ultimately antagonistic toward the other culture. Often this hostile position is triggered by feelings of distrust because of the gulf between what was previously projected about the unfamiliar culture and reality. When this cognitive dissonance occurs, intercultural communication appears unlikely to succeed. The model is applied to a historical case study: the first official trade encounter between members of a trade mission from Great Britain and Emperor Qian Long's court in China. Seven hypotheses for future research are proposed. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Through a survey of academic experts, we asked respondents to rate the top overall journals, business communication journals, technical communication journals, and the top journals from a technology perspective. In addition, we asked respondents to list the journals that they read most frequently. We analyzed the results by breaking down the rankings into world regions and academic departments. The top-three overall journals for all regions are Journal of Business and Technical Communication, Journal of Business Communication, and IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication. Importantly, differences by world region and academic department type were found in all these rankings. These results can support researchers worldwide by helping them target their publishing efforts to journals that have the best fit with their business and technical communication discipline, world region, and academic home. © 2007 IEEE.""Over the past decade researchers, instructors, and people in industry and academia have begun to understand the value of teaching people how to collaborate.

Socially oriented semiotic theories offer models of how language works symbolically in this way. A productive means of introducing these is to have students evaluate advertisements as forms of technical and professional writing. This study uses central ideas from Roland Barthes's essays on connotative semiotics as a rationale for directing writers to develop the critical reflex to analyze and then make judgments about the values implied by connotative systems. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, there are many situations in which web media cannot be localized and hence, culturally heterogeneous users must interact with the same interface. The emerging strategy for this kind of usability is known as the shared meaning or shared context approach. This paper presents results of a between-group study of culturally heterogeneous users who provided shared contextual meanings and performance measures from interaction with a web interface. Results were mixed but do suggest methods for how websites may be developed in shared situations. © 2008 IEEE.""The purpose of this study was to determine if a unit on listening that consumes little class time would signifi cantly increase listening skills.

The main cultural resource fueling this ideology is the counterculture and its social project. Virtual community, both as a discursive and as a social practice, is a culmination rather than a resolution of the modern conflict between community and individuality. Presenting virtual community as a panacea for modern social tensions, especially that between individualistic and communitarian ideals, hides from sight not only some of the negative aspects of on-line social life (cliquish behavior and incivility) but also the role played by communication technology in fragmenting modern society. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Readers of this Journal for the past several years have been kept up to date on the development of the business communication program at the University of Houston.

Finds that a form developed using information design principles collected significantly more data than did a control form."The study is concerned with maximizing communicative effectiveness by tailoring messages in light of the receiver's information processing ability, that ability being a function of the number of cognitive categories com prising the “mind” and referred to as cognitive complexity. It was hypoth esized that cognitive complexity would cause people to process sentences differently depending upon whether they were high or low in cognitive complexity. Sentences varied in terms of the number of clauses and the location of those clauses relative to the main subject-verb combination. Cognitive complexity did, in fact, appear to predict ability to recall these sentences, particularly those with clauses occurring after the main subject- verb unit. People high in cognitive complexity had significantly better recall scores than people low in cognitive complexity. © 1982, Sage Publications.

The vast majority of content-management implementation projects proceed with very little visibility into the cultural dynamics that will eventually play such a central role in determining the success or failure of the projects. This case study examines the usefulness of deploying a needs assessment questionnaire to gather qualitative data that could help content-management project leaders understand participant needs, attitudes, and perceptions, and that could potentially improve the implementation of content-management projects. Research questions: How might previously published research questions for assessing cultural dynamics be adapted for a questionnaire intended to gather input from participants in the early stages of the implementation of two separate content-management projects? What kinds of issues does the questionnaire elicit from participants? To what extent is the questionnaire useful in assessing content-management project participant needs and how might it be revised and adapted for other organizational contexts? Situating the case: Implementing a content-management project results in a change to organizational processes; careful attention to managing this change is essential to the success of the project. Specific change-management issues emphasized in literature that addresses organizational and technological change include organizational readiness, stakeholder input, communication of project goals and plans with stakeholders, and training and time to learn and practice new approaches to operations. Organizational culture - a set of beliefs and values that members of an company share in common - plays a role in implementations of technology. Assessing organizational climate and stakeholder values and attitudes - characteristics of organizational culture - as part of a change-management plan can ensure that the culture is addressed when implementing a content-management project. Methodology: This project consisted of three parts: designing a pilot questionnaire based on a previous published methodology for assessing cultural dynamics, conducting the questionnaire within two organizations implementing content-management systems, and assessing the extent to which the questionnaire was useful in the context of the content-management projects. Responses were analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach. About the case: We developed a cultural dynamics needs assessment questionnaire and deployed it within two organizations with the purpose of gathering data about the attitudes and perceptions of project participants toward the impending content-management system implementation. The questionnaires informed the implementations of content management as anticipated. Conclusions: A questionnaire can help understand the cultural dynamics impacting the adoption of new technologies and processes; this method can be included as part of an overall needs assessment for a content-management project. This study also confirms the merit of the research methodology followed; the questionnaire design elicited thoughtful responses from participants and the analysis approach illuminated insights that were then used to engage participants and modify project implementation plans. The constructive outcome of this study suggests the need for more empirical studies and field evaluation studies that build on this one. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Describes the requirements and selection procedure for a documentation management system adopted by a large multinational manufacturing company* Provides information about the system's features and operation, implementation, and benefits""Hypertext documentation is commonly available; however, there is no consensus about how to use hypertext. In this paper we do not define hypertext documentation, but instead describe and classify different approaches by surveying a number of existing systems. The survey comprehensively lists features of each system, but does not numerically compare systems because of the subjective nature of evaluation. Instead, the data provided should be used as a basis for local comparisons by the reader. The classification breaks systems down according to publishing type, i.e., those designed for both publishing and accessing hypertext, either publishing or accessing documentation, and those that use general purpose hypertext systems for document production and presentation. These categories are further subdivided according to functionality and specific system information. © 1992 IEEE""This study was conducted to determine how business administration grad uates employed in different types of positions spend their time communi cating. Job category was found to be significantly related to percentage of time spent in speaking and writing but not in listening, reading, or other activities. Undergraduate business major was significantly related to per centage of time spent in speaking, listening, and writing. The report con cludes that certain communication courses should be required or strongly recommended as part of the curriculum for the various business admin istration major areas. © 1980, Sage Publications.

A 12-cell schema of visual coding modes and levels provides a model for describing and evaluating business documents as flexible systems of visual language. Emphasizing clarity and objectivity, the “information design” movement has generated guidelines for creating functional visual displays. However, visual language in business communication is seldom rhetorically “neutral” and requires adaptation to the contextual variables of each document, a goal the writer can achieve by com bining visual and verbal planning in the same holistic process. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Specifically, it explores (1) to what extent does the theory of planned behavior capture user evaluation of different functions? (2) to what extent does pleasure have positive effects on intentions of different functions? (3) to what extent could the implementation intention theory identify the important functions? Literature review: To answer these questions, we look at the Theory of Planned Behavior which has been used to examine a single function device and test the predictability of the theory for a multifunctional system. We also review the Implementation Intention Theory and test the predictability of the theory for identifying important functions. Methodology: A quantitative survey of more than 200 smartphone owners in information-technology shopping malls and customer service centers for major smartphone brands was conducted. Results: The results from the data collected show that the theory of planned behavior and the additional pleasure construct explain more than 50% of the variance in intentions. The effect of pleasure on intention varies from one function to another. In general, pleasure shows much stronger effects for high-hedonic functions than for low-hedonic functions. In addition, the Implementation Intention Theory reveals that phone and organizer are the most important functions. Implications: These results contribute to research on multifunctional systems and communication technology, the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Implementation Intention Theory, and to the practitioners. However, the results of this study may be somewhat limited to users in a modern city. Future research could extend this study to include a task dimension, to compare different technologies and their functions, and to look at modality preferences.""Attempts to define the study known as organizational communication have generally had little success in achieving professional consensus.

Yet, existing pedagogy presents memorandum subject lines with no regard for context. This article introduces a taxonomy for subject-line com position that takes context into account by classifying memorandum subject lines as either neutral or directed. Analysis of 483 memorandum subject lines led to the development of this taxonomy. Findings from this analysis, as well as findings from several follow-up exercises which tested the usefulness of the taxonomy, indicate that writers compose memorandum subject lines much as pedagogical materials recommend and that these subject lines are usually neutral. However, when given alternatives, writers actually prefer directed subject linesforsomesituations. While the study focuses on subject lines in managerial memorandums, the proposed taxonomy and findings on writer choice may be more broadly applied and have important implications for pedagogy and research on managerial writing. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Students learn about science from the English instructors, and they also learn English from scientists by studying the writings of Lewis Thomas, Isaac Asimov, Michael Faraday, Thomas Henry Huxley, and many others. Because the program is English-oriented, the students get a broader view of science, and they learn how to make art and science work together in technical communication. © 1989 IEEE""In this article we seek to reframe accountability by means of an emphasis not on auditing but on student performance, not on the development of databases but on the creation of reflective practice. We attempt to demonstrate one model of program assessment that focuses on student performance as the center of a reflective assessment framework that can act as a technology transfer model for the diffusion of program assessment knowledge.""Four different instructional approaches for improving listening were compared: a control group, a lecture, a video role model, and a lecture plus a role model. The students' listening techniques were then observed in a simulated supervisory-subordinate conference. Students exposed to the video role model asked more questions than those not exposed to it. Also those students exposed to any three of the instructional strategies did a better job of summarization and were more likely to take notes than the control group. © 1985, Sage Publications.

The study shows that a combination of the novice's family background, a university engineering communication course, and workplace experiences helped him achieve success. It also provides evidence that, even though genres may differ from workplace to workplace, experienced professionals do recognize and accept superior communication practices imported from elsewhere. Thus, best practices may be taught apart from local contexts. The case study allows technical communication instructors and researchers to refine current understanding of what mastering genres means and indicates directions for the development of new pedagogies. © 2005 Sage Publications.""This study was undertaken to supply some possible explanations concern ing effects of personality systems on the encoding and decoding process of individuals.

In a public transport setting, where ticket counter closures have left different groups of people dependent on TVM to meet their mobility needs, a single, effective system is required. Research questions: (1) Which barriers do currently hinder the usage of TVM? (2) Which requirements should a barrier-free TVM fulfill? (3) How can we design a new self-service TVM for a nationwide public railway company? (4) How can we ensure that the usability and user experience (UX) is high for all users, especially for those with low levels of technological affinity? Situating the case: Most other studies on the use and usability of TVMs were conducted as post-hoc evaluations. In contrast, our case study presents a user-centered design (UCD) approach that takes the needs of the different target groups into account throughout the whole development process. Theories and concepts that guided the case included UCD, which involves alternating test and evaluation loops that actively involve users to create a usable product and UX, which describes the quality of the experience a person has when interacting with a specific computer system using a specific interaction technique. Methodology: More than 250 participants were involved in focus groups, observations, interviews, and experiments from the very first stages of development. Interface designs were presented to the future end users to obtain their feedback, with the results fed back into the design process. About the case: A prototype for a novel generation of TVM was developed in three phases: First, the context of use was analyzed. In the second phase, we conducted a requirements analysis. Third, different hardware and software interaction designs were iteratively tested and evaluated. The resulting prototype met the requirements of most user groups, though further adjustments are necessary. Conclusions: The UCD approach proved to be a valuable framework for the development and design of self-service systems. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Accounting educators recently have focused increased attention on the role of the formal curriculum in developing writing skills. Prior research results may be of limited use in curriculum development because these studies rely almost exclusively on the testing of accountants.

Therefore, the user's input should be considered when evaluating the writing skills of accountants.""This article explores accessibility ontologically, proposing nonequal design as a way to include and encourage difference. Part One situates the possibility for a multiple version approach to accessibility; Part Two finds affinities in science and technology studies where several figures have explored the politics of multiple versions of ontologies; Part Three introduces three design principles - syncopation, medium specificity, and versioning - for enacting how an nonequal approach opens up generative possibilities for accessibility. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Studying corporate documents provides clues to the larger philosophy of the organization. This article explores a sales document redesign that indicates a subtle shift in ideology for a women's clothing company. The corporation uses direct sales to market clothes to a variety of women. In one season, the documents change from relatively outdated designs to more updated, professional layouts. However, the content of the documents changes very little. The author contends that the document redesign indicates a move to a more feminist outlook for the company and uses the concept of ethos to describe how the document design represents a slowly changing ethos for the corporation. A specific content shift towards feminism is, however, less apparent. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This study examines how a technical writing team managed the transition to single-source documentation  The team divided content about cardiac devices into hundreds of ""topics"" that could be repurposed for manuals  The transition to single-sourcing yielded high quality documentation but required complex document review processes.""This case study reports on the experiences of designing and assessing the effectiveness of a faculty development program on writing across the curriculum (WAC). The report focuses on the question: What are the key components of an effective faculty development program to integrate WAC into engineering and scientific courses taught by faculty in those disciplines? Situating the case: Two main models of WAC implementation exist: Direct instruction, which uses writing specialists to deliver instruction to engineering and science students, and the department-centered model, which instructs faculty in engineering and scientific disciplines to teach writing as part of technical courses. How the case was studied: A report of the experiences of the authors and the feedback from the participants. About the case: The workshop was aimed at teachers in various disciplines and covered these main topics: Fundamentals of writing theory and pedagogy, writing assignment design and assessment, and situating writing assignments in courses across the disciplinary curriculum. It took place over 10 weeks during a 15-week semester and included large-A nd small-group meetings, consultations with the members of the university WAC program, and peer review of writing assignment drafts. Conclusions, limitations, and suggestions for future research: Key challenges in developing the workshop included designing ways to bridge the conceptual gap between the participants' and WAC instructors' understanding of the role of writing in disciplinary courses, limited time available to the participants, and scheduling challenges. The workshop was given seven times. Most of the faculty participants (90%) generally found it to be very effective or effective. Studies of workshops with larger populations of trainees are suggested. © 2016 IEEE.""To determine the role of business communications in AACSB accredited schools, questionnaires were mailed to 198 schools accredited by or affiliated with the AACSB. Of the 142 schools responding, 108 (76 percent) offered at least one course in the area, and 60 percent offered this course at the upper division level. While most schools called their most basic communication course business communication, an analy sis of course content suggests a more accurate title would have been written communication. This emphasis on written communication was felt to be due to the fact that the course was frequently taught by business education or office administration. © 1979, Sage Publications.

It states that the ABCA need to emphasize credibility in research efforts. It presents the results of a communication research questionnaire sent to members of the ABCA and states that members of the ABCA are not as active in research and writing as they could or should be. It suggests that one reason for the decline in research is due to an apprehension toward conducting research among ABCA members, and comments on the need to increase research credibility and respectabilty.""Instruction in the writing of abstracts is of growing importance for technical writers, both as a valuable skill in its own right and for the beneficial side effects on other writing competencies.

The communication needs of students studying in such foreign-language contexts have not been fully explored. In this study, the authors interviewed a purposeful sample of professors teaching a variety of specialties in the School of Business in an environment in which English is a foreign language in order to ascertain their perceptions of students’ ability to communicate in English, and these teachers’ ability to focus on their students’ writing skills. The findings reveal that although these teachers asserted the importance of communication skill, particularly in written English, they did not feel that nurturing that skill was part of their academic responsibilities. They felt that they had neither the time nor the expertise to nurture students’ ability to communicate in English. © The Author(s) 2014.""Technical communication research should link the academy to industry and sustain both with a foundation for solving problems and identifying new areas of inquiry. However, the publication needs and motivations of academics and practitioners have resulted in content alignment issues so divergent that it oftentimes appears that both parties are from different planets. Method: We empirically analyzed the content within 1,048 published articles over a 20-year period within core professional and academic forums. We coded the articles for variables related to topic and audience. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and correspondence analysis. Results: Our field’s core content forums have evolved little over the last 27 years. Results also indicated distinct differences in article topics and audience that reflect the varying interests of academics and practitioners. Intercom and Technical Communication Quarterly emerged as the most defined forums. Conclusion: The incongruity within professional and academic articles further suggests that we are a fragmented discipline. We recommend that our current content forums adopt structured abstracts and implications statements to unify our research and that researchers seek alternative audiences for their scholarship. We also call on practitioners to strengthen their involvement in research, either by contributing to scholarship or by volunteering their organizations as research sites. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

For effective documentation reviews, whether they are conducted internally or externally as part of usability testing, it's important to use precise questions that will provide concrete information on which to base revisions. This paper proposes an approach to obtaining useful feedback that emphasizes negative, ""what did we do wrong?"" questions. This approach focuses limited resources on areas that need improvement, rather than areas that already work well and that don't require immediate improvement.""The paper reports on a study to find patterns of refereeing practices, and to identify clues to recognize whether the papers in a journal are refereed or not. The study was made on a small but global scale of a wide field of disciplines with a direct-mail questionnaire. A sample of journal titles was selected from the Linda Hall Library's serial holdings list. Journals were placed in two categories, small or large, so that all the small journals received the same number of manuscripts as those received by the large journals. Where differences between small and large journals were significant, the data are shown separately; otherwise averages are given. Among the subjects the questionnaire dealt with are rejections, numbers of referees, processing papers, superreferees, and others.""This study focuses on people's choices between electronic mail and voice mail. We found that users generally preferred electronic mail over voice mail for most communication purposes. These results do not support a hypothesis derived from Media Richness Theory that voice mail would be preferred to e-mail for ambiguous situations. A more important finding is that other medium features besides richness influence individuals' media choices, specifically, medium features useful for retrieving and preparing messages and for working in group settings. From this and other evidence, we conclude that a complex set of social factors governs organizational media use in ways that neither theory can fully explain. Our findings have some interesting implications for designers of multimedia communication systems and for people like human resources specialists who are concerned with improving the effectiveness of professional work and the quality of working life.""This experiment tested the effect of access to an object's affordances on the development of an accurate situation model of procedural texts. The 40 participants read two sets of instructions while either doing the task or only reading the text. They then rated each sentence in terms of its difficulty and the type(s) of problem(s) it had (if any), and told how they would fix the problem(s). As predicted, participants who did the task tended to notice improperly ordered sentences, whereas those who only read the text (without seeing the device) tended to focus on grammatical problems. The results were consistent with the indexical hypothesis of Glenberg and Robertson (from their 1999 article in Discourse Processes).""The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) has instituted, on an experimental basis with professional society and commercial publishers, a clearinghouse service to provide its customers with simplified access to journal article copies.

We discuss implications of these strategies that must bridge the communities of medical, social, and legal practice. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""How do software companies evaluate whether accessibility criteria mandated by law are met? Confirmation is often provided by filling out a checklist. However, the method used for determining compliance to the checklist is not specified. Typically the task of filling out the checklist is done by accessibility specialists, usability professionals, quality assurance testers, or, in one case we know of, the development team that wrote the software. We have conducted several types of accessibility evaluations, walkthroughs, and testing with scenarios by sighted test participants and testing by blind test participants. While testing with blind participants takes considerable preparation time, we have uncovered important findings that were not revealed with sighted participants. We consider accessibility testing by blind participants an important component of our evaluations.""The International Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge, recently established by the National Science Foundation (NSF), is an alleged attempt at public outreach. The NSF encourages scientists to submit visualizations that would appeal to non-expert audiences by displaying their work in an annual ""special feature"" in Science magazine, and each year they present the winning image on the cover of Science as the ultimate reward. Although the NSF advertizes the competition as an attempt to educate non-scientists, the visualizations lack sufficient textual explanation in the Science special feature articles and do not demonstrate clear significance for current issues in science. This article assesses the actual motivations behind the NSF's ""Visualization Challenge,"" given the lack of accompanying textual information, and it explores the consequences of allowing ""scientific"" visualizations to float into the public sphere unexplained. It will be shown that the spirit of this competition exemplifies the current shift from ""public understanding of science"" to ""public appreciation of science"" in the growing field of Science Communication, particularly through the technique of ""framing"" devices. This shift in objective, accentuated in the realm of visual communication, reinforces the public's view of science as a mythic authority. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The study seeks to add to the current debate on English as a lingua franca by analyzing the role of the native speakers of English in intercultural business negotiations and to what extent they effectively accommodate lingua franca speakers. The data, gathered from a sample of 14 native English speakers and 13 nonnative English speakers, consist of interactions collected through a discourse completion task and a short questionnaire. The results showed that the native speakers in this sample used a wider range of linguistic devices than the nonnative speakers. The majority of the native speakers attempted to accommodate nonnative speakers, but there was significant variation in the way that individual participants chose their strategies and approached accommodation. The most striking finding was the imbalance between the native speakers' understanding of the issues of intercultural communication and their inability to effectively accommodate nonnative speakers. The implications are discussed. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article assists technical communication professionals in planning, designing and implementing a content management system (CMS) in their organization. As my organization discovered, few resources exist explaining the considerations involved in such an initiative, and there was a noted lack of information to help us plan for human-based factors affecting its success. This article attempts to fill that gap by relating our experiences. Method: We first monitored the CMS to understand its use by our organization's authors. Next, we conducted a survey to understand their perceptions of the system. We then made changes to the system based on the answers gathered in the survey. Finally, we monitored the system's use once more after the changes were made. Results: Our study suggested that authors did not want to use the new system because they were insecure in using it, perceived it as too difficult to use, and were unfamiliar with the system (among other issues). We then implemented a more familiar interface, created a version control system allowing them to revert to previous versions if they made mistakes, and created and deployed Web-based video tutorials. Finally, we tracked a noted increase in the use of the system by our authors. Conclusion: Based on our experience, for future technical communicators considering a CMS, I suggest involving those affected as soon as possible, implementing tools that are familiar, providing multiple methods of training, and creating mechanisms to ease anxiety about mistakes and errors.""This paper defines and critiques three cultural models for structuring and using information: accumulation, circulation, and association. In these “economies,” information is something to be hoarded (as accumulation), moved (circulation), or connected to other pieces of information (association).

Such a high error rate would seem to seriously diminish the usefulness of published reference lists and, possibly, raise questions about the accuracy of other portions of the literature also.""While the interactional functions of head nodding in everyday Japanese conversation have been frequently studied, a discourse on head nodding as a professional communicative practice has yet to be explored. With the method of multimodal conversation analysis, the current study examines the role of nodding in a particular professional-client setting, namely, hair salon interactions. My interest specifically lies in the frequent occurrence of synchronized head nods during the ""service-assessment sequence,"" where both service provider and customer inspect and determine whether the completed work is adequate. I pursue mechanisms of synchronized head nods by revealing exactly how participants collaborate in producing a nod, and how their verbal actions may at times be designed accordingly. In doing so, the study provides insight into what consensus may look like at service encounters in Japan, and discusses how such nodding practices may contribute to a satisfactory closure of a business negotiation. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""With the burgeoning in recent years of the service sector, emotion management by frontline employees is becoming an increasingly prevalent means of differentiating one service provider from its competitors. Chronic emotion management, however, is thought to have serious negative consequences on the health of the employee in terms of stress and stress-related disease. This study addresses for the first time the empirical question of whether there is a direct link between emotion management and stress, by using a new self-report tool aimed at measuring emotional suppression/faking among 137 frontline employees. The results suggest that high levels of emotion management occur in at least one third of all frontline communications, and that the more emotion management performed, the more stress experienced. The implications for technical communicators and researchers are outlined.""Finding itself at the center of highly publicized legal and political deliberations over fairness in testing, personnel credibility, and legal liability, the training department at a North American transit authority adopted a genre system that enabled the production of objective evidence of job competence, which was then used to make objective decisions about who passed and failed various training programs. The ongoing genre-structured activity of the department involved not only the regularization of organizational texts but also the regularization of social interaction mediated by those texts, which, while producing the types of interpretively stable documents required for successful public deliberation, led to a shift in authority and social relations within the department that instigated considerable resentment and loss of morale among many veteran instructors.""Regular evaluations are essential to the success of an organization. Only by reviewing and assessing the quality of work it performs can an organization recognize and play to its strengths as well as identify and address its weaknesses. The same process holds true for academic departments and divisions as much as it does for corporate entities. In both cases, the key to effective review and assessment involves identifying an organization's objectives and then determining how well the activities of that organization meet those objectives.""Technical literature abounds in a variety of abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms that may bewilder even the specialist reader. Acronyms such as UNESCO and RADAR have become so common that some authors forget that these are acronyms and write them in lower-case letters. This article discusses this shorthand vocabulary and the problems it causes, then concludes with some sound advice. For example, the following guidelines should be helpful to authors of technical papers, reports, and other documents: (1) Use acronyms and abbreviations sparingly, especially in the title of a document. (2) Expand all abbreviations when used for the first time in a document. (3) List in alphabetical sequence all abbreviations used in a document, and place the list preferably at the beginning of the document. (4) If there are variant forms of an abbreviaion, choose the form that is recommended by a professional society, and use it consistently. (5) Standardization agencies and professional societies such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) have developed standard abbreviations and guidelines. Use only those abbreviations that are approved by an appropriate society in your field."The use of acronyms in technical and nontechnical communications is steadily increasing.

Their study reveals ways that community members struggle to define the problem and work together as they gather, share, and understand data relevant to that problem. The authors argue that the primary goal of action research related to environmental risk should be to identify and support the strategies used by community members rather than to educate the public. The authors maintain that this approach must be supported by a thorough investigation of basic rhetorical issues (audience, genre, stases, invention), and they illustrate how they used this approach in their study. © 2008 Sage Publications.""Action research has been presented as a promising approach for academic inquiry because of its focus on real world problems and its ability to provide researchers with a rich body of field data for knowledge building. Published examples of action research, however, are hard to find in business communication literature. What are the reasons for this? In this paper, I try to provide a basis for answering this question as well as helping other business communication researchers - particularly those interested in computer-mediated communication issues-to decide whether and when to employ action research. I offer a first-person, confessional tale-like account of an action research study of computer-mediated communication in groups. In order to focus on the lessons learned, my focus in this paper is on the process of conducting action research and not on empirical results. Some of the situations and related lessons discussed here are somewhat surprising and illustrate the complex nature of action research. The doctoral research, conducted over four years in Brazil and New Zealand, highlights the challenges associated with action research's dual goal of serving practitioners and the research community.""Based on an interpretive case study in a large petrochemical company, this paper provides evidence for a theoretical framework based on the relationship of abstract and personal trust to the effectiveness of long-term virtual teams. This theory of virtual teams states that, when all other enabling factors for trust and effective virtual team working are conducive, then four elements exist: first, personal trust is most effectively established or reinvigorated through geographically collocated social interaction; second, personal trust is an antecedent to the activation and operation of effective virtual teams; third, abstract trust is an alternative to personal trust as an antecedent to the activation and operation of effective, short-term virtual teams; and finally, personal trust gradually dissipates over time without collocated social interaction. This theory leads to four propositions about the role of ubiquitous computing for virtual teams. These propositions draw from the mobility brought by ubiquitous computing to potential and active virtual teams. The mobility can be used to collocate (perhaps rhythmically or routinely) team members for the purpose of enabling or sustaining perpetual virtual teams. © 2007 IEEE.""Electronic collaboration has become a driver for productivity as organizations develop linkages for the planning, sourcing, and execution of goods and services. These organizations require mechanisms to harness the diverse and personalized intellectual resources that are distributed across the world. While electronic collaboration technologies have made it possible to harness intellectual resources across space and time, knowledge management is locked in a paradox of perception - The more valuable a knowledge resource is seen to be, the less it is shared. This paper develops a framework for the activation of knowledge that relies on a view of knowledge as identity. The analysis of a case study reveals activation conditions that delineate processes in which electronic collaboration technologies can be most effective. This has implications for the creation of collaborative work environments that enhance knowledge activation in organizations. © 2005 IEEE.""In this article, we aim to convey our excitement for credit-based directed research groups, explain why we believe that they are becoming institutionalized in our curriculum, and provide information to help those interested in this subject to understand how to implement and support such groups. The first section of the article presents a brief description of two of our earliest research groups, to provide a framework and point of departure for understanding the several variant forms that have since been adopted. The second section discusses in more detail the basic structure and rationale for the groups. The third section looks at variations in the format of the groups and discusses the advantages of maintaining flexibility in how such groups are implemented. The fourth section discusses the outcomes of the research groups in terms of participation, breadth of topical coverage, and scholarly productivity, followed by a discussion of the impacts on learning in the fifth section. Finally, after reflecting on some of the challenges and unintended effects of the innovation, we close with a brief look to the future.""This study examines how students enrolled in two Web-based sections of a technical writing class performed compared to students enrolled in a conventional version of the class. Although no significant difference in student performance was found between the two learning conditions, our data reveal intriguing relationships between students' prior knowledge, attitudes, and learning styles and our Web-based writing environment. One finding that we focus on here is that reflective, global learners performed significantly better online than active, sequential learners, whereas there was no difference between them in the conventional class. Our study highlights the complexity of effective teaching and the difficulty of making comparisons between the online and the classroom environments. In particular, we maintain that the transfer of active learning strategies to the Web is not straightforward and that interactivity as a goal of instructional website design requires significant elaboration."Shows how adult learning and situated learning principles can be applied to classroom-based software training  Argues that these techniques create instructional strategies that incorporate context-rich activities for work-oriented instruction."This article draws on activity theory, politics of the artifact, and speech act theory to analyze how language practices and technology interplay in establishing the social relationships necessary for globally networked teams. Specifically, it uses activity theory to examine how linguistic infelicities and the politics of communication technologies interplay in virtual meetings, thereby demonstrating the importance of grounding professional communication instruction in social as well as technical effectiveness. That is, students must learn not only how to communicate technical concepts clearly and concisely and recognize cultural differences but also how to use language and choose media in ways that produce the social conditions necessary for effective collaboration in globally networked environments. The article analyzes two case studies-a workplace and a classroom-that illustrate how the mediating functions of language and the politics of technology intersect as mediating tools in globally networked activity systems. It then traces the implications of that intersection for professional communication theory and pedagogy. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""Situated learning theories offer useful insights into how learning to write can be supported and transacted through interactions between newcomers and experienced practitioners in academic and professional domains. Reporting the findings from a study of a mentoring relationship in physics, this article addresses how such processes work to teach composing in advanced academic contexts and what can make them more or less effective. The author identifies and discusses three factors that may constrain situated learning in such contexts and the transmission of authority that purportedly occurs through such learning. These factors include newcomers' existing skills for, and approaches to, composing, which may limit their acquisition and use of new skills; the implicitness of situated learning, which may pose difficulties for newcomers as they struggle to grasp the conceptual complexity entailed in composing disciplinary texts; and the location and distribution of authority in practitioner/newcomer relationships, which may inhibit newcomers as they struggle to acquire and establish their own authority by making original contributions to their fields."Explains the controversy surrounding the Office Assistant in Office 97 in terms of role conflicts between actual and implied readers.

To use an American-based behavioural simulation, Looking Glass Inc., in Hong Kong, we needed to adapt it to the students' language environment and proficiency, their culturally derived behaviours, and their understanding of the context of American business. In Hong Kong, the norms prescribing language use are complex and contradictory; English is a major business, government, and legal language, but Cantonese and sometimes Mandarin have a continuing presence, especially in oral communication. The English in the simulation, however, reflect ing the authors' emphasis on realism, included slang and idiomatic expressions that were confusing even to students otherwise fluent in the language, and thus we had to modify materials to aid comprehension. We also had to adjust our administra tion of the materials to account for cultural differences between the individualistic and low power distance dimensions of the American scene represented in the sim ulation and the collectivistic and high power distance environment our students found more comfortable. Our strategy in adapting the simulation was to stimulate participants in Looking Glass Inc. to act authentically in their roles, negate reac tive and promote proactive behaviour at all four organisational levels, and encour age the thoughtful and complete analysis of the simulation, not something that came naturally. Finally, we had to make explicit several elements of American business assumed by the authors but not known to the students, including Ameri can geography and transportation systems, laws and administrative bodies, and race and gender issues. © 2000, Sage Publications.

The assignment requires both informal and formal document development in a team environment and uses cooperative learning strategies to assure full participa tion by all students. Students thus have the advantage of discussing an important current business issue, are facili tated in this discussion by the use of structured learning techniques, are required to exercise their thinking and writ ing skills in a variety of ways, and in many cases must acquire new technical and intellectual skills for communi cation across the Internet. © 1995, Sage Publications.

As someone who has taught in both settings, I believe that trainers and profes sors have much to gain from pooling ideas. With this in mind, I first observed and then participated in a week-long “Presentation Skills” workshop taught in a Fortune 500 company to determine what aspects of that program might be transplanted to a traditional university public speaking course. I then took ideas gained from the work shop and applied them to the public speaking classes I taught at a western university. This article is an examina tion and discussion of this process. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Linear information structures are ubiquitous in the US for many reasons but generally address writer-responsible authoring, low. context communication styles, individualism and achievement, and monochrome or sequential temporal order. Each of these characteristics addresses the cultural requirements of the majority of e-learners in the US. However, when adapting or internationalizing e-learning environments for other cultures, many US assumptions fail to meet the unique demands of the target audience. Consequently, a streamlined and minimalist linear information structure excludes numerous cultural requirements for many international audiences. Using an example developed at a global technologies firm in California, this tutorial explains the proven effectiveness of current US e-learning prototypes and delineates the internationalization requirements for Japanese audiences. © 2006 IEEE.""Previous research in technical communication indicates service-learning pedagogies can help prepare students for the workplace. The field, however, has only recently and tentatively extended these pedagogies into online environments and has not yet demonstrated how and whether such service-eLearning could as effectively bridge the gap between the classroom and workplace. In this article, the author discusses one such extension and offers a framework and model. © 2014 Copyright Association of Teachers of Technical Writing."This article explains and evaluates an experimental class in speech communication which attempted to integrate students' occupational interests with traditional requirements of introductory speech courses. It specifically focuses on a class comprised of engineering and engineering technology majors and their responses to the basic course presented in an environment compatible with the selection of technical topics and the use of technical language."Disaster areas and developing economies put great demands on relief and development personnel to adapt efficiently to fast-changing conditions. We draw on experiences at Mercy Corps and the literature on learning organizations, adaptive expertise, and communities of practice to identify five systemic tensions that need to be balanced when designing effective learning solutions: (1) employees' desire to learn versus the pressures of the job, (2) investing in strategic learning initiatives versus the need to keep organizational operating costs low, (3) formal learning versus informal learning, (4) maintaining flexibility within a local context versus organization-wide standards that create efficiency and accountability, and (5) people versus technology. We offer examples of possible solutions to the individual and organizational learning challenge in relief and development organizations. © 2009 IEEE.""A study was undertaken to determine which tree species can best maintain itself in a landfill environment; to investigate the feasibility of preventing landfill gas from penetrating the root zone of selected species by using gas-barrier techniques; and to identify the (those) factor (s) which are most important in maintaining adequate plant growth on completed sanitary landfills. Ten replicates of nineteen woody species were planted on a ten-year old completed sanitary landfill and five gas-barrier systems were constructed. Of the nineteen species planted on the landfill, black gum proved most tolerant and honey locust least tolerant to anaerobic landfill conditions. Of the five gas-barrier systems tested, three proved effective in preventing penetration of gas into the root systems of the test species. Investigations into the effects of CO//2 and CH//4 contaminated soil indicated that red maple is more tolerant to the presence of these gases than is sugar maple.""Technical writing need not be dry either by design or default. Without neglecting precision and conciseness, language and phrasing can be used to assist rather than impede understanding. Putting style in technical writing can be aided by awareness of these devices: alliteration, anaphora, antemetaboly, antithesis, climax, colon, epistrophe, metonymy, and simile. Examples of each are included. We can infer from the representative selections more precisely what technical writing style should be: 1. It is writing that displays a literary quality. 2. It is writing that uses the best words, expressions, and phrases to communicate. 3. It is writing that takes advantage of all devices or techniques that can enliven the prose without interfering with the communication of a precise, concise message.""Technical writing instructors have long taught audience analysis and audience awareness to their students. But when international audiences are considered, the discussion is often limited to ways to help nonnative English speakers deal with the necessity of writing in English. This paper takes an opposite perspective, considering how to teach native English speakers to be sensitive to the cultural differences they will find when they communicate with nonnative speakers in the classroom and, later, in the professional marketplace. Several books and articles are cited to complement a brief, simple teaching method for introducing this subject in the technical writing classroom. © 1992 IEEE.""We designed three versions of an instruction manual for a cellular telephone, using strategies that aim to increase the cellular telephone’s usability and senior’s motivation to use this telephone. The strategies focused on 1) gaining and maintaining users’ attention, 2) increasing their sense of relevance concerning the instructions, and 3) increasing users’ confidence, respectively. We asked seniors between 60 and 70 years of age to work with either one of these motivational manuals or with a control version without motivational elements. Our study shows no statistically significant differences for participants’ satisfaction with the instruction manual or with the cellular telephone, or for their self-reported motivation scores. However, participants using either the relevance or the confidence enhancing version of the instruction manual did perform more tasks correctly than participants using the control version. Moreover, participants using the confidence enhancing version less often gave up working on tasks than participants in the control group."Explains the concept of value added and shows how return on investment can be calculated Provides case studies and literature that suggest many different measures that technical communicators can use to show how they add value"Scientists and engineers who want to write about their research for a worldwide readership must write so that they can be understood not only by other technical persons, but also by translators, who may not have a good knowledge of the subject area concerned. Many guidelines exist to help writers express their ideas clearly, thereby facilitating translation. However, scientists and engineers may find it difficult to apply guidelines that call for a high level of linguistic awareness. For reasons of economy, noncritical texts are likely to be issued without editing. In these cases, there are precautions, described in the article, that the writer can take with regard to clarity of terminology and verification of intelligibility. © 1991 IEEE""Does language reflect psychological reality, or does it form psychological reality? In other words, does the language we use to discuss something determine our attitudes toward that thing? Feminist literature has made much of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, which asserts that linguistic bias is a cause rather than a symptom of social bias (F.W. Frank and P.A. Tretchler, 1989; F.J. Newmayer, 1986). However, conflicting views do exist on the direction of influence. The article discusses a recent study published by M.A. Dyrud illustrating a clear gender bias in computer clip art (see Business Commun. Quart., vol.60, no.4, p.30-51, 1997). Dyrud argues that if language, as a symbol system, both reflects and invents our reality, the same can be said of another symbol system, that of visual images. If the images are predominantly one gender, they may reflect cultural mores, but at the same time they help to sustain those beliefs by shaping our concept of what is real. Her study examines more than 14000 images in Windows based programs. She found that gender bias does exist in available visuals. In addition to a bias in presentation, clip art is also a man's world in terms of sheer numbers of images. Of 14108 images, there were three times as many male as female. The attitude of available images also differs: male figures-often of athletic build with full heads of hair-are usually in motion; female figures are usually standing, waiting, or even posing fashion-model style.""The global business community makes understanding cultural differences importantfor business communication students, ourfuture managers and negotiators.

Although this assignment offers a viable approach to understanding how power influences language, students should recognize that multiple variables can affect actual language use. They can also scrutinize the responsibility they implicitly assume when they perpetuate - or perhaps attempt to change - an organization's communication style.""America's transition from a manufacturing to an information-oriented economy means many college students need more than a basic course to prepare them for the sophisticated communication tasks awaiting them in business and government. The University of Delaware offers an advanced course that emphasizes the management of document production, covers forms of communication not usually addressed in basic courses, develops editing strategies, provides ″internal internships″ for interdisciplinary teams of student writers, and requires the computer for all writing assignments. The course simulates industry's use of project teams and introduces students to principles of project management.""The article discusses the AdvancedManagement Communication course at Dartmouth College.

To be effective in this important task, the advisor needs to understand the cultural dimensions of work and of internships in particular. The faculty advisor is pivotal to the success of any internship-particularly in international settings-and must understand how an international context affects the selection, training, and monitoring of interns and the evaluation of the internships.""A proposal to substitute technical writing for freshman English rests on questionable beliefs about the two courses. Freshman English is not neglecting to emphasize the development of communications skills, and technical writing cannot be broadened enough to replace freshman English without becoming a course in freshman English. Both courses have important roles to play in the university. Freshman English should continue to concern itself with general communications skills, and technical writing should continue to involve the application of these skills to special kinds of communication.""The “computer explosion” has had a number of undesirable effects on corporate communications. One of these is that well-established and integrated communication systems have been replaced by poorly designed and mismatched computer systems. This has caused a number of communication functions to be performed and administered by amateur communicators rather than by communication professionals. The effects on people and output have been drastic, even affecting management credibility. Professional communicators are exhorted to reestablish themselves as the experts on corporate communications so that the undesirable effects due to the computer explosion and the amateur communicators can be corrected. Computers can then assume their proper role in corporate communications.1 © 1989 IEEE""Much has been written about how to evaluate static graphics from the perspective of clarity, ethics, efficiency, and power relations.

In 1967 a 500-member test group responded favorably to a biweekly hard-copy SDD system consisting of preprints and journal items in their selected topics. However, a proposed follow-on program languished for lack of funds; an analysis in 1971 indicated that the documents from AIAA alone would be too few for a viable SDD system, and a survey in 1972 showed that interest in SDD had declined. Therefore, the AIAA is no longer actively pursuing SDD. A Synoptic is a 2-journal-page presentation of the key results of a work in directly usable form (including selected tables and/or figures), backed by a full paper that is available on request at cost. Synoptics now replace about 25 percent of the full papers in AIAA journals, with reasonable success in respect to quality (the communication goal) and acceptance by all concerned, but few members would approve their use in place of all full papers. Miniprints prepared by photoreducing author-prepared copy to half-size could save much money and shelf space. But minorities opposed them so strongly that this idea was shelved. Other questions on journal scopes, composition, and review procedures are also discussed.""We define international editing as editing documents for a multilingual readership or multinational distribution. We argue that international editing embodies and represents corporate global strategies, which directly affect editing choices.

These concepts are applied to technical writing and the reader is then invited to evaluate the improvements in readability in a small sample of texts.""This article challenges the conventional approach to cross-cultural communication teaching that instructs students to adapt their communication styles to different cultures by providing them with details about the particular practices of these cultures. It argues for an approach that focuses on common principles of effective communication by pointing out some limitations of the current culture-specific approach and presenting a pilot study that indicates the commonality of communication needs. It suggests some ways to find a different approach for studying international communication and shows that some current research is, in fact, moving in that direction. © 1999 Sage Publications, Inc.""Faced with the requirement to reduce the number of journal titles to stay within budgets, many librarians are considering cooperative activitites to share resources. At the same time the number of available current titles still appears to be increasing.

After a brief description of the approaches, they are compared on the basis of estimated costs and satisfied demands. Additional noncost factors are included in the final decision for a single new national center.""Much has been written about the importance of Web site usability. However, a Web site that is usable in terms of navigation can still have credibility issues that reflect negatively on an organization. As a result, Website credibility assessments have gained popularity, but little research in that area has examined one of the most common forms of Web site communication-that is, small business Web sites that do not pose risk and do not offer e-commerce. This paper begins to address that gap by exploring the relationship between Web visitor expectations and their credibility judgments about a small business based on its Web site. Method: I conducted research based on principles of Prominence Interpretation Theory of Web credibility. This research included focus groups of likely consumers to explore the relationship between Web visitor expectations and judgments about the small business Web site and credibility judgments about the small business. Data from the focus groups was used to: (1) determine the factors that women use when setting expectations and making credibility judgments about a small business based on their Web experiences, and (2) identify if those factors vary generationally. Results: The results of the research revealed that likely consumers of the small business did not believe the Web experience projected a credible brand with which they would want to engage. In other words, a Web site that was intended to promote the products and the store was ironically hurting the business by turning away potential customers. Conclusion: I show how a six-step credibility test (based on Prominence- Interpretation Theory principles) can be used by communications consultants, Web site developers, and small-business owners. Such a test is an effective yet simple approach to gauging Web credibility judgments and making sustainable Web site changes in organizations with limited resources. The ease of this test combined with the time- and cost-effectiveness make it especially useful for small business Web sites, where expertise and resources may be limited.""In this standard, the term abstract signifies an abbreviated, accurate representation of a document, without added interpretation or criticism and without distinction as to who wrote the abstract.""This article describes a course design that resulted from an academic and in dustrial collaboration. Unlike most simulation courses, the one described here was developed and taught by university professors and business professionals. One aim of designing the course was to find a way of teaching students that would better prepare them for writing in the workplace. A second aim was for the design-team members, through the experience of planning and teaching, to learn more about writing in the workplace and the teaching of writing.

Students experienced a ""workplace context"" within their university classroom (replete with timeline challenges, requisite managerial decisions, and assignment delegation). Methods: Students' performance on required course documentation and ability to satisfactorily complete course goals were examined, and exit interviews were conducted and analyzed through the lens of theoretical frameworks offered by Cook (2002) and Blakeslee (2001) and correlated to previous research. Results: Students in the course described developed new literacies (per Cook) and participated in a process of gradual exposure, experiencing ""exposure, authenticity, transition, and response"" as Blakeslee (2001) stresses, to professional, workplace communication genres. Conclusions: This client project can serve as one model for the kind of bridge for which Blakeslee et al. have called. A critical part of any bridge is its two ""destinations,"" so our study points to both footings of such a structure-academic learning modules and workplace practices-both of which must be further explored by technical communication faculty and the technical communication professionals with whom they collaborate and with whom they confer about university program efficacy.""This research is based on an analysis of a management communication training program used by one large US international hotel company to train newly promoted supervisors and managers in Hong Kong and mainland China. The key communication competencies emphasized in the training materials were listening effectively, giving and receiving feedback, using verbal language correctly, using effective nonverbal communication, and displaying empathy. Implications of this study indicate that planning and executing any communication training program must be done mindfully, which includes comprehensive follow-up through reassessment and coaching by the upper managers in order to support employees' transfer of training. © 2011 IEEE.""The article presents an analysis of communicatee responses to written business communications in the United States, and describes a study aimed to empirically prove the validity of good business writing principles.

Variables measured were receivers' interest, perceived levels of comprehension and retention, as well as information clarity. Significant differences existed among telecon ferences which had no graphics, conferences in which the graphics did not directly complement the audio message, and those conferences in which the graphics directly complemented audio messages. A higher number of graphics complementing audio messages did not result in significant improvements. Individual differences were not an interacting effect. The perceived quality of the graphics was significantly related to the perceived effectiveness of the teleconference. © 1989, Sage Publications.

The literature suggests that electronically mediated communication could affect students' stimulation due to reduced nonverbal communication, the ability to receive nonverbal positive reinforcement, and the opportunity to participate. These possibilities were investigated through questionnaires, observation, and interviews. Loss of nonverbal feedback from the professor was compensated for partially by greater communication and cohesion among the students. Increased communication among the students apparently compensated for any positive rewards that were not received via nonverbal communication from the professor. Participation between the professor and students was inhibited but participation among the students increased. Finally, slight apprehension was detected. © 1986, Sage Publications.

This study provides a view into how students make comments during a comprehensive edit of a technical document. Method: Undergraduate technical editing students performed a comprehensive edit of a report. Data were derived from the editorial comments students made during the edit. Comments were coded for level of the comment (global, paragraph, or sentence), phrasing of the comment, and quality of the comment. A total of 132 comments were coded. Results: Both effective and ineffective commenting habits were observed. Students were found to make a high percentage of paragraph-level comments and a low percentage of global and sentence-level comments. Most of the comments were rated as useful to an author. Looking at specific problem areas, most students missed commenting on four major problems within the text. The students seemed to be using a linear editing style of simply moving through the document from beginning to end, rather than using a top-down editing style or multiple passes. Conclusions: When given instructions to perform a comprehensive edit, most students made comments that addressed global and paragraph-level issues, rather than sentence-level or copyediting issues. However, the overall quality and usefulness of the comments varied widely. As part of improving both writing and editing skills, technical communication pedagogy needs to focus more on overall document structure and how to structure sections within a document.""This article presents the results of a stylistic analysis of 200 samples of electronic mail memorandums gathered from four organizations. Through systematic counting of textual features such as sentence and paragraph length, grammatical types of sentences, sentence openers, and diction, the study examines patterns of rhetorical choice common to electronic mail. In this sample, writers combined elements of formal and informal discourse but preferred simple coordinate sentence patterns, brief paragraphs, and active verbs. Additionally, the serial structuring of message content and reluctance to coordinate and subordinate ideas into appropriate rhetorical patterns indicate a general inattentiveness to providing logical frameworks for readers.""This article examines a number of management-oriented journals with respect to the authorship and school of origin of their articles. It attempts to assess the relationship between the perceived status of the school and the publishing activity of the school's faculty. In general, it shows that faculty from higher status schools are more active in publishing, suggests that there is value to faculty in publishing in nonrefereed journals, and further suggests that schools with lower status ratings can improve their status by encouraging publication by their faculties but that such encouragement should be through a system of positive rewards rather than through a publish or perish approach. © 1985, Sage Publications.

This article suggests that you can expand and refine any part of the basic sender-channel-receiver model to increase its usefulness. A communications analyst may need to look at a part of the model, as through a magnifying glass, to ex amine that part in detail. To magnify all parts simultaneously would make the model too cumbersome. Therefore, the author presents several designs, each highlighting a particular aspect of the communication pro cess. Environments, separate or shared, internal or external, may add to or subtract from a message. Feedback may be included or excluded. All of these may be represented graphically, but not in a single model. © 1979, Sage Publications.

Unlike assessment systems that evaluate only the group product, the system proposed here balances product and process, the lat ter embracing individual skills at interacting and contributions to the collaborative composing. The results of a systematic study of students' atti tudes toward their classroom experiences seem to corroborate our perspective as practitioners: With this assessment system, group members felt that they participated fully and practiced effective interactional behaviors, that they be came involved in the collaborative-writing process, and that the reward system was fairer than a single group grade. © 1989, Sage Publications.

The real problems stem from lack of, or poorly developed, point and audience awareness. Such problems can render reports useless for the audience and for the author. These major deficiencies and many lesser deficiencies, however, can be avoided effectively and painlessly if authors follow a simple outlining approach in writing their reports. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

A mental merger of the private and public aspects of both knowledge and communication, transaction is a meaning-making process, variable and unique, although similar situations lead to similar transactions. Because English classrooms do not encourage transaction, they are not the best places to teach technical writing. However, four maxims bring the spirit of transaction to our teaching. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The student sample consisted of two groups: trained (students who had completed a course in business communications) and untrained (students who had not completed such a course). The findings show that both groups are able to perceive stylistic differences one-half of the time and that trained students have a slight edge over untrained students with respect to labeling passages correctly. © 1986, Sage Publications.

With the increasing use of instant messaging (IM) for both informal communication and task performance in the work place, deception in IM is emerging as an important issue. In this study, we explored the behavioral indicators of deception in a group IM setting. The empirical results showed that three types of nonverbal behaviors and three types of verbal behaviors that were investigated could significantly differentiate deceivers from truth tellers. The findings potentially can broaden our knowledge of deception behavior in human communication and improve deception awareness and deception detection in the cyberspace. © 2005 IEEE.""Individual and work characteristics are used in telecommuting plans; however, their impact on telecommuting success is not well known. We studied how employee tenure, work experience, communication skills, task interdependence, work output measurability, and task variety impact telecommuter productivity, performance, and satisfaction after taking into account the impact of communication technologies. Data collected from 89 North American telecommuters suggest that in addition to the richness of the media, work experience, communication skills, and task interdependence impact telecommuting success. These characteristics are practically identifiable and measurable; therefore, we expect our findings to help managers convert increasing telecommuting adoption rates to well-defined and measurable gains. © 2010 IEEE.""Of the many recent studies linking technical communication and ethics, few present an ethical position in sufficient detail to make its rationale clear. This paper argues that utilitarianism, the ethical system of free-market capitalism, is limited in that it sanctions contingencies. Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative—to treat ourselves and others not merely as means but also as ends—offers a clear and powerful ethic that enables technical communicators to subordinate contingencies to an understanding of persons as rational entities possessed of full human dignity. John Rawls’s model of an ideal society derives from and extends Kant’s thinking on the primacy of human dignity in an ethical system. © 1993 IEEE""Firms that are trying to stay competitive in the current business environment often require the use of groups. The popularity of group work is tied to the promise of improved productivity via the pooling of information, knowledge, and skills. In recent years, group work has been expanded to virtual or distributed environments. However, there are questions about how aspects of group work - specifically group size and social presence - impact group members' ability to voice opinions. This study examines groups of two sizes in three distinct social presence settings: face-to-face, face-to-face using collaborative software, and virtual using collaborative software. This study finds that both group size and social presence affect individual instrumental voice, value-expressive voice, and the group interaction process. The results show that by increasing social presence through the use of collaborative software, it is possible to lessen the negative impact of increasing group size. These results should be of interest to the increasing number of organizations that are implementing virtual group environments. © 2006 IEEE.""Provides evidence that street addresses and links to external sites affect readers' judgments of the credibility of online information* Confirms the relationship between reader characteristics and credibility judgments of online information""Organizational communication received strong support as a predictor of job satisfaction and weak support as a moderator of the job performance-job satisfaction relationship in this study. Using data collected from 302 employees at two manufacturing firms, moderated regression analyses explored the influence of organizational communication on the relationship between job performance and job satisfaction. Lateral communication was found to moderate the relationship between satisfaction with pay and performance, while accuracy of information was shown to moderate the association between satisfaction with work and performance. Communication dimensions with the greatest support as predictors were accuracy of information, desire for interaction, communication load, trust in superior, influence of superior, and satisfaction with communication. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study was designed to examine the nature of the ideal supervisor and subordinate, then to compare the two concepts. The study showed that for both the ideal is one who is perceived as extremely competent, quite safe, extroverted, and emotionally stable, as well as slightly similar to his counterpart in attitudes and values, but neutral in background and appear ance. Furthermore, it was shown that for at least one-half of the individual criteria used in establishing these overall ideal qualities, there are differen tial expectations, with the supervisor almost without exception expected to reach a higher level of standards than the subordinate. © 1978, Sage Publications.

To investigate the contributions of listening to judgments of competence, this study examined how organization members use listening and listening-related factors in judgments of communication competence across situations. The results support the notion that listening plays a central role in assessments of communication competence. Analysis reveals that listening accounts for approximately one-third of the characteristics perceivers use to evaluate communication competence in co-workers. Additionally, the results suggest organization members differ in their use of listening in judgments of competence in several kinds of situations. © 1995, Sage Publications.

To that end, 180 upper division accounting majors at a major state university were asked to respond to six stylistic and organizational variations of a single advertise ment for the Totaltape CPA Review. To assess whether intended perceptual classifica tions could be engineered across various alterations in organization (2 levels: direct and circuitous) and style (3 levels: forceful, personal, colorful), a 2 x 3 between - sub jects factorial design was employed. Characterizing this experimental format were six separate treatment conditions and the random assignment of subjects to each. The results of the study indicate that with care, a consistent writer/reader percep tual match can be achieved. However, the study also indicates that persuasive writers should be very sensitive to the synergistic relationship of all elements of a document and to the readers' probable use of heuristics or schema in responding to a persuasive text. © 1989, Sage Publications.

Specifically, the study examines corporate descriptions provided to job seekers by firms advertising on the Internet site, Monster.com. The study also explores elements of corporate image presented in the descriptions and the way in which firms market their employer brands. The findings demonstrate how analysis of corporate descriptions reveals interesting insights into organizational recruitment tactics. Results suggest that firms focus predominantly on firm attributes and secondarily on employee advancement. Various industries approach recruitment advertising differently, with significant differences emerging between high-tech organizations, service organizations, and consumer product firms in the emphases of their corporate descriptions. Few firms present a distinct employer brand but tend to cluster together in brand types. © 2004 by the American Association for Business Communication.""A growing body of literature presenting the results of research regarding text book illustrations indicates that visual gender bias is obvious in several academic fields, including business communication. To date, however, no study has extended those observations to clip art files in popular computer programs. The current study examines over 14,000 clip art images for gender bias from six different Windows-based programs: WordPerfect Presentations, PowerPoint 4.0, Microsoft Publisher 2.0, Harvard Graphics 3.0, Power Up!, and Corel 3.0, CD-ROM. Tabulations indicate that only 4.54% of total images depict women and that they are typically presented in stereotypical roles, such as secretaries, nurses, teachers. Reasons include a male bias in the computer science field (a 3:1 ratio in programming), apparent gender-based differences in relationships with machines, and a societal gap in traruitioning between old and new media. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""The current trend of increasing instant messaging (IM) use and its potential growth motivate this study. It offers a novel exploration of users' preferences for IM in the context of the use of other traditional and new communication media: face-to-face, telephone, email, and short messaging service (SMS) in two distinct cultures: Australia and China. It examines the impact of demographics, media experience, media richness perception, and national culture on media preferences. Our results, based on a student survey conducted in the two countries, show that women prefer IM for communication activities that require more attention and personal presence and prefer email for communication activities that require less personal presence. Communication technology experience may predict the adoption of new technology, such as IM and SMS, but has no effect on media that are already widely adopted, such as email. Email was clustered with face-to-face and telephone as the most preferred media for any communication activity, while IM and SMS clustered together and were the least preferred media for communication. After controlling for demographics and media experience, we found significant cultural differences in IM, telephone, and email preferences. Chinese preferred to use IM and telephone, while Australians preferred to use email. The cultural impact on technology use is persistent. © 2008 IEEE.""Universities and colleges are investing millions of dollars in information technology infrastructure to support teaching, research, and service, and thousands of dollars annually in faculty training programs. And yet, many college graduates entering the workforce lack adequate technology skills. To ascertain the frequency of faculty adoption of information technology, we surveyed a random sample of faculty in the liberal arts and sciences departments in our university. Overall faculty members (n = 174) reported a low usage of information technology for teaching, though the rate of software adoption is higher than the rate of hardware adoption. While opportunities to learn technology are available, about two-thirds of the faculty members have not completed the available seminars and workshops on information technologies but prefer more informal ways of learning information technology, such as talking with other faculty members.""What communication competence ""means"" may depend on the unique characteristics of national cultures. This study sought to determine the kinds of communicative knowledge and skills that are most associated with communicatively competent members of Thai organizations. Questionnaire data (N = 413) were collected from a cross-section of individuals working in 14 different Thai organizations concerning their perceptions of the kinds of behaviors and forms of knowledge characteristic of communicatively competent supervisors, subordinates, and co-workers. Among other things, results suggest that Thais who are perceived to be communicatively competent know how to avoid conflict with others; control their emotions; display respect, tactfulness, modesty, and politeness; and use appropriate pronouns in addressing others. Findings also indicate that variability may exist among types of organizations (private, public, state enterprise) with respect to the degree to which employees value particular communication competencies. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication."This study investigates the combined impact of a memory test and subsequent listening practice in enhancing student listening abilities in collegiate business administration courses.

The inquiry provided evidence of the potential value of memory tests and listening practice as pedagogical tools that promote listening ability."A review of the research literature on college recruitment shows the impact of a candidate's interviewing skill on hiring decisions is equivocal. Whereas some investiga tions suggest an interviewee's verbal and nonverbal communication behavior plays the most important role, other research indicates it is the written information which in fluences selection decisions most. This investigation tested a contingency explanation for these discordant results, that is, the influence of an applicant's interviewing skills on recruiters' recommendations depends upon the relevancy of effective oral com munication to the position in question. Two hundred and forty recruiters were placed into one of 12 experimental groups in which the significance of effective oral com munication skills to the position, candidate verbal and nonverbal communication skills, and application qualifications were varied. Results from a 3 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance were mixed. Although effective oral communicators were more likely to be recommended for further consideration, the relative importance of oral communication and written credentials was dependent on the extent to which each was critical to the positions in question. © 1989, Sage Publications.

The structure of messages, including emotion-laden words, information content and hidden meanings, is discussed.""In response to the demand for business graduates with good communication skills, many schools are examining ways to enhance and strengthen their com munication programs to ensure students’ development of these skills.

In the form of dialogues between Yellow Emperor and his minister, its 24 fascicles cover four major topics of the organs, diagnosis, diseases, and treatments. While examining the body and discussing various diseases and treatments, the book expands on Yi Jing's philosophy through integrating three interrelated concepts: Tao, Yin and Yang, and Five Elements (word, fire, soil, metal, and water). In this way, the book, for the first time in Chinese history, explicitly treated humans and their behaviors as individual events conditioned by the natural context, emphasizing context as the conditioning force. This emphasis on context is manifest in modern Chinese technical communication as two textual devices of establishing personal relationships and creating ideal physical environments. © 2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Technical communicators are asked more and more to develop information for delivery on the Internet's World Wide Web.

The textbook preface is a highly interactive genre, with a double purpose: informative and promotional. The analysis of the genre moves and of their realization reveals that the preface is used by the author both to help the audience use the book and to convince them of the value of the book. This twofold purpose accounts for the most relevant features of prefaces: The frequent use of textual metadiscourse and the pervasive presence of evaluation. The criteria used in the preface to evaluate the textbook are related to the audience's expectations about introductory textbooks: novelty, usefulness, accessibility, comprehensiveness, importance, and interest. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Addresses engineering students' complaints that technical communication courses are not relevant to their major area of study Describes a joint course in metallurgical engineering and English taught in the same classroom, with credit given in both subjects""Since 1994, a course in international business writing has been taught simultaneously at institutions in Belgium, Finland, and the United States.

Analysis of variance results revealed statistically significant differences for training and gender. Those who had taken more than one listening training seminar or course scored higher on the inventory than did those who had had no listening training. Females perceived themselves as better listeners than males did. No statistically significant differences were found for age. On the whole, the inventory developed in this study may provide another dimension to measures of listening effectiveness. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

The results indicate that significant relationships exist between computer anxiety, and computer/wordprocessing, between computer anxiety, and computer electronic discussion group, between computer anxiety and online computer service, between computer anxiety and CD-RAM, as well as other types of technology. Other results reveal that students are least experienced with programming computers, computerized electronic discussion group, computer conferencing and Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDA). Significant differences occurred between gender groups on cellular phone scores, writing stories/poetry scores, computerized electronic discussion group scores, satellite TV scores, electronic videogames scores, and computer/video conferencing scores, as well as communication apprehension scores, writing apprehension scores, and computer anxiety scores. The specifics of these results and other significant differences are reported and discussed in this article. © 1998, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""We describe the communication component in a first-year MBA program that has been entirely integrated. In this integrated program, no courses, per se, exist; rather, the year's curriculum is built around stages in the business development cycle. We first consider the choices that a program developer has to make about whether communication instruction will be reguired or elective, with or without credit, in the form of courses or workshops, and independent of or integrated with the rest of a business program. We then describe the communication program, discuss the challenges of embarking on an integrated project, and suggest strategies for meeting them. © by the Association for Business Communication.""Companies that want to improve the communication skills of their managers might look at the following analysis of suggestions from 136 business managers and executives of the enormously successful and diversified Marmon Group of Companies. Researchers gathered respondents ideas and answers from two questionnaires to produce a quantitative group consensus as to what constitutes the most important areas of focus in business communications. By the respondents own choices, the course model focuses not on traditionally taught writing skills such as grammar, diction, and paragraph structure, but rather focuses on issues that, from a business point of view, are more urgent in day to day correspondence. For example, executives stressed the need for instructors to train people to write logically, clearly, and briefly, and to concentrate on such judgment skills as audience, tone, relevance, and timeliness. This desire to shift from traditional emphases opens a new approach to teaching business communications. It implies that there is a much greater need to base courses on real life case studies and to use business people as guest lecturers, since both can illustrate the kind of logical thinking that is necessary to avoid communication problems. © 1985, Sage Publications.

Successful interactions within international outsourcing require individuals to understand how cultural factors could affect online interactions. Today's technical communication students therefore need to understand how factors of culture and media could affect the success with which they operate in international outsourcing activities. This article provides technical communication instructors with a series of Web-based exercises they can use to familiarize students with different aspects that can affect intercultural online interactions. It also provides a series of online resources students can use to enhance their understanding of cross-cultural communication in cyberspace. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Teachers and researchers in the field of Technical English have always been concerned with the nature of this subject, its major characteristics, and its chief uses in Science and Technology. Obviously, less time and efforts have been spent on how technical English is learned, particularly in situations where foreign students have to relate their limited linguistic knowledge to meaningful realizations of the language system in technical texts of immediate concern to their specialist studies. This research is an early effort to show how technical English is learned and, more specifically, what relevant factors are involved in the overall learning process.""This study explores a comprehensive sample of experimental and quasi-experimental research within five leading technical communication journals over a 20-year period. Exploratory studies can overview how a method has evolved within a field, highlighting how it has advanced understanding of communication and identifying areas for further inquiry. Research questions: (1) How has experimental research in technical communication journals developed over the 20-year period? Specifically, how much is being published, which journals publish experiments, what topics are being explored, and what fields are informing this research? (2) What content characterizes experimental research in technical communication? Specifically, how explicit are the research questions/hypotheses, are the results of pilot studies reported, what are the sample sizes and populations used, and what measures do researchers use? (3) Who publishes experimental research in technical communication? Specifically, which authors and affiliates are most associated with experimental research, and how does the sample's gender and authorship distribution compare to existing research? Literature review: We first address how scholars have assessed research in technical communication and how these findings implicate experimental research. We then review features of other exploratory studies that inform this study's design. Methodology: We conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 137 experiments, a comprehensive sample identified from a corpus of 2,118 refereed papers published from 1992 to 2011. We coded 14 variables related to the causal relationships that the experiments addressed and who produced the research. We subjected the data to multiple statistical measures, including contingency table analysis and correspondence analysis. Results and conclusions: Over the 20 years, the journals published experimental research at a consistent rate. This could indicate that these methods have a stable presence in the field, or a discouraging sign that output is not on the rise despite calls from leading scholars. IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication (TPC) emerged as a strong producer of experiments, publishing 45% of the sample. TPC was also associated with most recent experiments, assuming this role from Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, which was associated with early experiments. In addition, TPC, Journal of Business and Technical Communication , and Technical Communication correlated with experiments on collaboration, pedagogy, and intercultural communication, respectively. The results also revealed that recent experiments reported significantly more explicit research question/hypotheses and pilot studies, an encouraging sign for the quality of future experiments. Finally, Spyridakis published the most experiments over the past 20 years, and researchers at the University of Washington and the University of Twente were the top affiliates associated with output. The configuration of both of these institutions' programs, which seem to align with a traditional science model, might suggest how the evolution of technical communication programs impacts the type of research that its affiliates produce. Our results are limited by the small, though comprehensive, sample and the exploratory natures of measures like correspondence analysis. Future research could use the proposed framework to investigate the evolution of other research methods in technical communication, strengthening our body of knowledge. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This essay offers the first analysis of analogy in research-level mathematics, taking as its case the 1837 treatise of William Rowan Hamilton.

It reviews the correlation between task versus relationship behavior that forms the basis of the Situational Leadership model. Then the article summarizes information found in literature on effective techniques for the four skills stated above. As these techniques are identified, they are discussed in relation to their effective use in the Situational Leadership model. To understand the application of the model in businesses and its impact on managers' communication effectiveness, we conducted a study of an operational department of a Fortune 500 financial services company. The results and content analysis of a survey we administered by random selection of the managers in this department indicate that successful use of the Situational Leadership model relies on effectiveness in four communication components: c ommunicating expectations, listening, delegating, and providing feedback. Finally, we recommend areas of future research such as comparison analysis of surveys, interviews, and focus groups with subordinates of managers who have been trained on the Situational Leadership model and those who have not.""This study explores the interactive relationship between apology, as a crisis-response strategy used in the current Toyota recall crisis, and product involvement in influencing the restoration of the organization's reputation and customers' future purchase intentions. The authors measured the impact of the interaction between participants' perception of an apology and their product-involvement levels using a 2 (perception of apology: high sincerity vs. low sincerity) × 2 (product involvement: high vs. low) experiment design. The results showed that an apology was an effective strategy for repairing the organization's reputation for those participants who were highly involved and perceived the strategy as highly sincere, but it did not increase their purchase intentions. © The Author(s) 2012.""The development of technical manuals has been investigated by the Department of Defense in many research and development programs, yet major deficiencies in the quality of manuals still exist. The authors studied four publication houses in an attempt to identify factors in the design and development process that may be contributing to manual deficiencies. The writers attributed most of the problems to the inadequacies of the specifications that govern the writing and to the lack of expertise on the part of the Government representative. The writers, while professional, are not trained writers but rather are selected for their subject-matter expertise. The quality-control process, including the final evaluation, seldom if ever includes evaluation by members of the intended audience."Provides a framework of experiences and skills employers call for in job postings  Shows that potential employers are seeking very technical or domain-specific knowledge from technical writers  Shows that specific technology tool skills are less important to employers than more basic technical writing skills."The recent addition of a writing performance assessment to the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) means that many students now enter business school with a writing assessment score and perhaps even a heightened awareness that writing matters in some way to the successful completion of an MBA degree. This situation presents teachers of business and managerial writing with a new opportunity and pressure to provide students with writing tools that are directly relevant to their business studies and professional careers. The Analysis of Argument Measure and the Persuasive Adaptiveness Measure introduced here are assessment tools that may be used to explain holistic assessment scores (which students receive on the GMAT writing component) and may assist students in understanding and evaluating their writing, both in school and in the workplace. Designed to evaluate managerial documents that are persuasive and directorial in nature, these measures were developed through a series of pilots and used to assess a selected sample of managerial memorandums that were also scored holistically. Correlating the holistic and analytic scores revealed a positive association, and interrater reliability achieved good agreement beyond chance. These results suggest that the measures may be reliably employed to assess characteristics valued in managerial writing. Examples of how these analytic measures may be employed for teaching and research are also described. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Generally they focus their efforts on eliminating specific writing weaknesses such as indiscriminate presentation of detail or unrelated presentation of ideas. This article suggests that they should concentrate instead upon the attitude that underlies the varied symptoms of encyclopedic presentation. Essentially, analytical writing controls not only the information of the document, from a single word to a whole picture, but the way the information is read. An encyclopedic document, on the other hand, allows for a variety of readings or, should we say, misreadings. Whereas certain kinds of discourse, such as poetry, fiction, and even essays, often receive multiple readings, and indeed deliberately invite them, technical communication aims at clarity and consensus. Or to put the case for analytical writing in T. P. Johnson's words: 'Every interested reader should interpret it exactly the same way' - an achievement, we believe, still worth the effort.""In analyzing audiences for software manuals, documentation developers need to move past a strictly cognitive vision of users ‘needs and examine the social and organizational factors that influence task performance and instructional needs. In order to discover the ways in which social and organizational factors affect users’ tasks and their acquisition of knowledge and skills, I conducted a survey of 25 people who use databases at work. All survey respondents use database programs as tools for conducting job tasks that involve complex analyses and reporting of data. I examined the relationship between people's technical proficiency and task complexity and their job roles, professional responsibilities, flexibility in work arrangements and modes of workplace learning. Findings show that learning to use databases for complex tasks in work contexts entails more than merely learning concepts and procedures for executing program functions. Users need to learn ways of manipulating a program, integrating and combining its functions in inventive ways to serve the purposes of various types of job tasks and to support professional approaches to these tasks. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Through case studies in letter writing and analysis, students apply key communication prin ciples in an international context.""Writers, editors, and teachers of writing believe that a substantive difference in style exists between writing which is truly excellent and that which is merely adequate. As researchers, they ought to be able to measure some of this difference. This article focuses on a number of stylistic characteristics that teachers of technical writing say are important and reports on the analysis of samples of various types and levels of technical writing.""This study investigates the genre structure of Chinese call-center discourse based on data collected from the call centers of a telecommunication company in China. Using an integrated theoretical framework informed by approaches to genre from English for specific purposes, systemic functional linguistics, and social perspectives, the study focuses on an analysis of the recurrent situation and social practices, the communicative purposes, the move structure, the exchange structure, and the generic-structure potential of call-center communication. A corpus-based quantitative analysis further reveals the dynamic complexity of interaction at call centers. The study compares Chinese and English call-center interactions in order to illustrate universal language functions as well as institutional and cultural differences in this professional discourse. The findings may have implications for both academics and practitioners in the call-center industry. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""And is a necessary and useful word. It has both basic and derived meanings. But it is a word to examine alertly when one is writing lest it convey an unintended meaning and lest it produce an unpleasant and inefficient flatness of style. Difficulties with and usually are of three kinds: (1) use of and in place of a more exact connective, (2) illogical omission of and or its replacement by an unsatisfactory substitute, and (3) use of and where no connective is required.""This annotated bibliography includes all articles published in the Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 1978-1980. The articles are divided into the following categories: 1) The Profession, 2) Education and Pedagogy, 3) Preparation and Presentation of Technical Information, and 4) Applied Theory in Technical Communication.""This annotated bibliography includes all articles published in the Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 1971-1977, with each of the 233 articles appearing in one of the following five major categories: (1) The Profession, (2) Education and Pedagogy, (3) Preparation and Presentation of Technical Information, (4) Publication and Personnel Management, (5) Applied Theory in Technical Communication.""Corporate annual reports typically include a narrative section and a financial section. The narrative section is not scrutinized by auditors as the financial section is, yet many readers rely heavily on its graphs to estimate the firm's financial situation. However, the graphs often misrepresent the financial data. To better understand annual report graphs' important role, this article examines more than 25 years of literature related to these four areas: (a) the ways financial graphs are prepared, used, and misinterpreted; (b) differences by country; (c) regulatory influences for accountants; and (d) the parts formatting and media selection decisions play in communication interpretation and persuasion. Across the literature, the author notes consensus that annual report graphs are widely used in many countries and that there is rampant disregard for the guidelines for their accurate, non-misleading presentation. The article concludes with seven proposed directions for future research. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Since the collapse of Enron Corporation in November 2001, annual reports and corporate financial disclosures have been the focus of government, corporate, and public attention. This article examines the literature written about annual reports between 1989 and 2001 to identify trends in research and determine areas of future study. Articles were categorized as related to SEC regulations and guidelines, summary annual reports, online annual reports, rhetorical analysis of annual reports, readability and accessibility of annual reports, methods of conveying negative information in annual reports, effective annual report writing, use and importance of annual reports, or use of annual reports in business writing classes. Post-Enron, it is likely that the number of articles in this area will dramatically increase over the next five to ten years.""Because of doubts about the status of paragraphs after World War II and the influence of readability formulas which emphasize sentence length and word length, technical writing teachers and texts have not been concerned very much with stylistic matters, especially at the paragraph level. However, recent research advances in the fields of linguistics, discourse analysis, cognitive psychology, and readability all redirect our attention to matters beyond the sentence in technical writing. A familiarity with such advances - including an understanding of cohesion elements, the ″given-new contract,″ and tagmemics (study of the smallest unit of grammatical form) - can enable technical writing instructors to improve student writing.""While scholars have begun to write a history of reports and instructions, little scholarship exists on the history of proposals. To fill this gap, I analyze proposals written by Dorothy Wordsworth and Anne Macvicar Grant, ca. 1800. My analysis uses contemporary rhetorical theory to determine how they structured their writing and incorporated rhetorical appeals to achieve their goals. My findings show that their texts should be placed on a continuum of the history and development of the proposal genre. Further findings suggest that their use of contemporary rhetorical theories authorized Wordsworth's and Grant's discourse to successfully affect change.""Anti-employer blogs, those which criticize companies or their employees, are posing significant legal and ethical challenges for corporations. The important legal issue is the conflict between the employee's legal duty of loyalty to the employer and the employee's right to free speech. Although U.S. and state law describes what an employee may or may not say in a blog, corporations should encourage employees to contribute to the process of creating clear, reasonable policies that will help prevent expensive court cases. The important ethical issue concerning anti-employer blogs is whether an employee incurs an ethical duty of loyalty. In this article, I conclude that there is no such ethical duty. The legal duty of loyalty, explained in a company-written policy statement that employees must endorse as a condition of employment, offers the best means of protecting the legal and ethical rights of both employers and employees.""This article discusses the advent of anytime, anywhere communication capability and its potential impact on our society. It examines the ways in which technology becomes accepted and integrated into our lives, including the role of human values. This report also focuses on both the beneficial and detrimental effects of emerging communication technology, such as its ability to put the disabled and disenfranchised on equal footing with the rest of the on-line population, and the possibility that individuals will become so isolated behind their computer screens that they will lose the ability to carry on face-to-face relationships. Finally, privacy and data security are discussed, as well as the limitations of physiology in a 24-hour society. © 1996 IEEE.""The goal of this article is two-fold: • It argues technical communicators can challenge current models and/or approaches of how to design materials for international audiences. • It explains how technical communicators might consider using a technique offered by a mobile application called App Abroad to document commonplace cultural interactions to support reflection from users from different cultures. Methods: The article draws from technical communication theory and practice to explain a bottom-up method of designing effective materials for international audiences. Results: By creating opportunities to document cultural encounters through media that can convey the complexity of face-to-face communication, readers learn to seek a more bottom-up approach to understanding culture. Conclusion: Because culture is not static but constantly transforming, technical communicators must challenge traditional models that seek to address culture from the perspective of a single, national cultural identity. Rather, a more “bottom-up” (that is, not predetermined) understanding of cultural communication practices is needed to help technical communicators create more effective materials for international users. A bottom-up understanding of culture can support improved intercultural technical communication outcomes. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

Apparent feminism provides a new kind of response that addresses current political trends that render misogyny unapparent, the ubiquity of uncritically negative responses to the term feminism, and a decline in centralized feminist work in technical communication. More specifically, it suggests that the manifestation of these trends in technical spheres requires intervention into notions of objectivity and the regimes of truth they support. Apparent feminism is a methodology that seeks to recognize and make apparent the urgent and sometimes hidden exigencies for feminist critique of contemporary politics and technical rhetorics. It encourages a response to social justice exigencies, invites participation from allies who do not explicitly identify as feminist but do work that complements feminist goals, and makes apparent the ways in which efficient work actually depends on the existence and input of diverse audiences. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.""As a CEO's reputation and symbolic power have been found to have positive effects on organizational effectiveness, corporate reputation, and financial analysts' stock recommendations, companies have an interest in presenting their CEOs as competent vis-à-vis audiences, such as employees, the press, and the financial community. Departing from impression management, this article examines a sample of CEO profiles from corporate websites of large North American and European companies in a content-analytic design. The results indicate that impression management is more prevalent in North American CEO profiles. In particular, leadership roles in associations, the CEO's social stance, nominations in the press, and the CEO's involvement in political activities play a bigger role in the construction of CEO competence in North America. Whereas CEO profiles of North American companies show CEOs as active participants in social, political, and public life, European CEOs are presented as primarily business-focused. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The research presented here shows that commonly accepted principles of American written business communication such as “reader concern,” “positive emphasis, “and “conversational tone” have cross-cultural validity in communicating with a group of Mexican college students. These stu dents read letters from two fictitious Mexican life insurance companies– one company's letters structured with American principles of written busi ness communication, the other's without. Use of the semantic differential showed that the Mexican students formed favorable mental images of the company using “accepted principles” and negative images of the company not using them. Additional research is suggested for improving written business communication between the United States and other countries and cultures. © 1976, Sage Publications.

As presented, such materials tend to undermine opportunities for issue identification and assessment. Through review and interpretation of that employment interview research which addresses the relationship between applicant appearance and interviewer selection decisions, the purpose of this paper is to encourage those who teach, train, and counsel others on employment inter viewing to devote more studied attention to appearance issues and ethics. To that end, five instructional proposi tions are offered. Each proposition is developed through review of related research and then capped by instructional observations. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Documentation presented on these displays is being called 'online information. ' The resolution limitations of video display terminals and the impermanence of their images require that print practices be modified when information is presented online. Online information should be spaciously laid out on short lines in upper- and lower-case and with liberal use of such retrieval aids as underlines and color. The authors summarize the research behind these and other guidelines.""Technical materials often do not produce the response desired by their authors. Reasons for the failure of the document are errors in audience analysis and the rapid obsolescence of the materials. This article suggests that communication theory, in general, and cybernetics, in specific, may help ameliorate these problems. The knowledge of communication theory and systems analysis could sensitize editors of technical materials to a variety of facors such as the dynamic nature of the communication process and the fact that the process is interactive rather than unidirectional. It is suggested that the application of these theories could increase the effectiveness of technical communication.""This case study describes a small independent, also called self-standing, Technical and Scientific Communication program and the ways in which this program assesses itself. The term assessment covers three different, but connected areas: students, faculty members, and program. Though different instruments were used for each assessment, no area can be judged apart from the others. We thus assume that data gleaned from one instrument ought to be applied to the other areas. Our assessment recognizes the inherent overlaps among the tools; it also led to our re-examining existing data to seek ways to use descriptive statistics. We shaped procedures and processes into a methodology that allows us to study parts individually, in relation to each other, and in relation to the whole. Here we share our assessment methods and results so that colleagues can use them for their own evaluation activities.""Distributed learning theory is valuable for teachers of online business communica tion courses because it 1) highlights complexities of software tools, not only the online course interface, but also tools used to produce Websites, brochures, CDs, and other multi-media elements; 2) provides a way to address online communica tion dynamics, such as online chats and discussions, that students will practice in the workplace; and 3) allows teachers to examine how their previous experiences teaching business communication in more “traditional” classrooms affect teaching online. Highlighting these areas allows business communication teachers to focus on the critical use of technology in online formats that entail relatively new teach ing media. The critical application of technology use can be seen in areas like tool evaluation and use, power and divisions of labor, and community participation. © 2003, Sage Publications.

Programs in recent years have become much larger, more complex, and subject to faster changing market conditions, and the object-oriented model appears better suited to address these new realities. Technical writers are facing a similar challenge as the volume of information is growing exponentially and increasing in complexity. This paper describes the object-oriented model, shows how the model is influencing the world of documentation, and proposes that it be considered as a basis for the creation and maintenance of large libraries of technical information. © 1996 IEEE.""The strategic choice model, which suggests that choice is dependent on communication goal and probable receiver response, is applied to motivational options useful in con structing persuasive messages. Specific options are identified according to power-based, nonpower-based, and shared power-based categories. The relative force of the specific options is determined by goal and response individually and in their relation to each other. Thus, the relative strength of specific motivational options is plotted graphically for all three categories, with a “natural home” or position of greatest strength identified for each option. © 1991, Sage Publications.

First, when evaluating the success of a training program, clients typically use one principal measure: employee productivity. Rhetorical concerns aside, instruction must translate directly into increased job efficiency. Second, clients may hire writing consultants to solve alleged writing problems that are, in fact, disguised management problems. Consultants need to perform their own careful diagnosis and be alert for organizational issues having little to do with writing deficiencies. This article explores these two caveats in the context of a six week training program held for engineers and technicians of a manufacturing firm. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Many such buyers turn to the reviews now avail able in magazines, journals, and business publications. Often, these reviews are seriously flawed: by the reviewer's lack of experience with similar systems, by the lack of adequate testing time, by ragged and inconsistent review crite ria, and by a mismatch between the reviewer's needs and the reader's. This article spells out minimum review criteria for software reviewers, seeking to aid the business- and technical-communication community in selecting software. © 1987, Sage Publications.

By using cooked cases, writing teachers ignore or undervalue important skills that writers need in the workplace: initiative, the ability to plan, and the ability to get along with other people. Business- and technical-writing teachers ought to use at least one “raw” case in class to help students develop the practical skills that will serve them best on the job. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Forty-eight factory directors from state-owned enterprises completed a survey in which they reported what they would say to workers in obligatory and nonobligatory work situations. Descriptive coding was used to develop message category systems for each situation. A more interpretive form of analysis was used to identify how the cultural themes of values, political ideology, and changing managerial roles were reflected in the influence approaches reported. The interrelated cultural values of group-centeredness, hierarchy, and face concern were reflected most often, followed by political ideology and changing managerial roles. Results reveal how managerial influence in China is best understood within the relational, political, and economic contexts in which it occurs. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""The already existing and future economic atmosphere will significantly affect scientific publishing during the next several years. Distributors and retailers are joining what was essentially a one-component (i. e. , the publisher-manufacturer) industry. The original product (the journal or book) is spawning a wide variety of secondary, derivative, and aftermarket information products. It is becoming possible to deal in machine-readable information equivalents, e. g. , a scientist's current workbook entries, rather than with a post-experiment journal paper describing the research.""Study One determined that buyers are more interested in the task, rather than the social, aspects of the buyer-seller relationship. They prefer sellers who are trustworthy, composed, and task-oriented. Study Two showed that sellers are well aware of buyer's preferences for task related interaction, but they may slightly overestimate the value of social interaction. Four complex communicator style profiles were obtained through cluster analysis. Buyer preferences did not vary across Communicator style profiles, which suggests that adaptive selling advice may be misguided. However, for buyers, the profiles revealed that Apprehensive, Social, or Competitive sellers may need more communication skill training than Cooperative sellers. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""As an alternative approach to web preproduction, I propose the use of concept maps for invention of website projects in business and professional writing courses.

Then, a quantitative analysis uses capital markets data to assess the investor impact of tone and other stylistic attributes. The genre analysis explores the regulatory context, structural attributes, and dual informational-promotional role of earnings press releases, using individual releases as illustrations. The quantitative analysis explores the relation between the stock market reaction to earnings press releases and quantitative measures of style developed using elementary computer-based content analysis of a corpus of releases. Results suggest that tone influences investors' reactions. An explanation for this result is provided by prospect theory, which predicts that framing financial performance in positive terms causes investors to think about the results in terms of increases relative to reference points. Results also suggest that longer press releases reduce the market impact of unexpected earnings. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication."This article examines the question of student honesty in student ratings of a business communication instructor.

Surprisingly, the published discourse of our field seems to implicitly minimize the gendered nature of business and technical writing workplaces and classrooms. To understand this apparent lack of focus, we review five technical and business communication academic journals and build on previous quantitative evaluations done by Isabelle Thompson in 1999 and by Isabelle Thompson Elizabeth Overman Smith in 2006. We also review nine popular textbooks using a content analysis method based on Thompson's work. Finally, we discuss current research in feminist pedagogies vis-à-vis these results and our own experiences in the professional writing classroom. © The Author(s) 2015.""Although the business processing outsourcing (BPO) industry in India and the Philippines is keen to employ good English language communicators, especially to work in call centers dealing with native speaker customers, it is by no means certain that the investments they are making into their language recruitment assessment processes are paying off. Many call centers are reporting recruitment conversion rates as low as 1%. It is further reported that the lack of English language skills is the main reason for rejection. But how exactly are the call centers carrying out their English language recruitment assessments? How effective are the BPO industry's recruitment assessment tools and practices? This article will report on a study of English language recruitment assessment practices carried out in two multinational companies (MNCs) that have BPO sites in India and the Philippines. One of these MNC sites offers IT and back office support and the other operates a global network of call centers. Research access was granted to their human resource departments to shadow their recruitment language assessment practices, to interview key stakeholders, and to collect and analyze relevant documentation. The study revealed a problematic stakeholder understanding of what to look for in language ability when recruiting staff; it also revealed the problematic use of language assessment tools and practices in terms of validity, reliability, practicality, and fairness. It will be argued in this article that this unfortunate combination may be resulting in unreasonable language assessment ""gatekeeping"" to BPO industry employment and that the problems being experienced by the BPO industry to recruit enough good speakers of English may reside more in their own practices than in the levels of English of their graduate applicants. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""Does an open information policy pay off, or does it simply give away technical and scientific advantages of a country?

However effective these appropriations are, they isolate these resources from a comprehensive framework and from that framework's role in shaping disciplinary practice. Because these theoretical assets are integral to each student's preparation to be an effective, responsible practitioner, I have developed and taught an upper level rhetorical theory course for STC majors that is grounded in Aristotle's On Rhetoric and in his understanding that effective communication is a systematic tekhne/art. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This essay analyzes business communication in order to generate an ap proach to ethics based in the rhetorical process of corporate life. Through a study of the role of language in creating and disseminating values, the essay first extends the Aristotelian paradigm for ethical communication to the rhet oric of business.

Applying his theory of writing found in his Rhetoric, Poetics, Posterior Analytics, and Categories treatises to his History of Animals illustrates his work as a writer of life science.

The essay concludes that further study should examine other rhetorical dimensions of his science writing. © The Author(s) 2015.""Phishing e-mails deceive individuals into giving out personal information which may then be utilized for identity theft. One particular type, the Personal Solicitation E-mail (PSE) mimics personal letters-modern perversions of ars dictaminis (the classical art of letter writing). In this article, I determine and discuss 19 appeals common to the PSE. These appeals were established first by conducting generative rhetorical analysis, then by volunteer coding, on 170 e-mails collected over a 12-month period. After defining these categories, I show how these letters are excellent twenty-first century teaching tools for pathos-based argumentation, logical appeals, the creation of ethos, and kairos in the development of perceived exigency."Some companies invest large amounts of money in corporate art collections. One of the reasons for this investment may be that works of art can be used to communicate corporate identity. The aim of this study was to explore whether people are able to align a work of art with a given corporate identity. Forty-six participants rated the fit of eight works of art with four different corporate identities of existing companies. The results showed that participants agree strongly with respect to whether a work of art was aligned with a specific identity. That works of art can be recognized as aligned with a company's identity has important implications for companies that use reproductions of works of art to decorate their walls insofar as customers may take the art as a symbol of the company's identity. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.It is contended that a title should contain maximum information in a minimum of words.

This article partly remedies the deficiency by explaining how a statement is accepted as a fact or an opinion. The effect of, and relationship between, the verifiability of a statement and its pre cision are also discussed, and dangers of dogmatic credibility by insistence are noted.

ASAPP has three components: electronic boilerplate, a dedicated proposal team, and a five-phase process for proposal development. The electronic boilerplate is reusable text on management structure, related experience, general capabilities, personnel abilities, and company policy. The team members fill six roles: proposal manager, text coordinator, writer(s), contract officer, text processing leader, and graphics leader. Their authority and responsibilities provide efficiency and coordination for the proposal effort. In phase I the team constructs an outline, makes writing assignments, establishes deadlines, and pulls together boilerplate information. In phase II the team drafts the technical approach so an official bid/no-bid decision can be made. If the company decides to bid, the boilerplate and the technical draft are coordinated and developed in phase III. Phase IV focuses on editing the successive drafts as they are produced, and phase V involves reviewing the last draft and producing the proposal in final form.""Understanding the globalization of business practices is an important area of learning for students studying in master of business administration (MBA) programs today, and many graduate business programs offer study tour programs for experiential learning.

This article reports an assessment of a series of online modules the author designed and piloted for a business communication course that she presented in a hybrid format (a combination of computer classroom sessions and independent online work). The modules allowed the author to use classroom time for observation of and individualized attention to the composing process. Although anecdotal evidence suggested that this system was highly effective, other assessment tools provided varying results. An anonymous survey of the students who took this course confirmed that the modules were effective in teaching important concepts; however, a blind review of student work produced mixed results. © 2008 Sage Publications.""Employers consistently rank communication skills, in particular writing ability, among the most important skills for undergraduate business students to possess. However, improving writing skills, especially with respect to punctuation, grammar, and word choice, often requires substantial teacher time and effort. To assess and improve student writing skills in a time-efficient manner, the authors developed a computer-scored measure of students’ ability to edit for writing mechanics. The authors tested the method with a pretest and posttest design and found that when students were held accountable for improvement (with 5% of the course grade dependent on improvement), there was a significant increase in students’ ability to edit. Without that accountability, improvement did not occur. © 2004, Sage Publications.

Students felt that the specialist, stand-alone communication program was more effective than their 3 to 4-year degree per se in delivering communication instruction, but certain business fields (e.g., actuarial science) felt this more strongly than others (e.g., information systems). The implications are that expert tuition is essential and that a customized, more nuanced approach will ensure greater job literacy. Experiential teaching strategies that encourage student voice; workshop diversity; real-life scenarios; and supportive, scaffolding marking interventions will further consolidate skills development. In particular, communication teachers need to work with students and other stakeholders to deepen understanding of computer-mediated communications (CMC) and the expanded needs of a multicultural global society. © 2004, Sage Publications.

This study investigates target audiences’ attitudes toward GM infographics. Two focus groups perceived GM as a practical information source that aided them in decision making and daily business operations. They preferred viewing graphics to texts and particularly favored statistical graphics. They also identified issues with viewing GM infographics on mobile devices. Based on the study’s findings, the author proposes three areas that communicators can address when designing infographics in similar contexts: content, usability, and overall visual appeal. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""As the US population becomes more diverse, the enrollment of English-as-Second- Language (ESL) students in colleges and universities continues to expand. This diversity may sometimes lead to problems for business communication teachers who must assess the written communication skills of students who may not be fluent in English. To address these problems, we conducted a nationwide survey of business communication teachers, soliciting input on how ESL students' written communication skills were assessed. Respondents were asked to identify areas where their assessments of ESL students might differ from their assessments of stu dents whose first language was English. Comparisons were made based upon teachers' gender, age, number of years of teaching experience, and geographic location where they teach. Although some grading leniency was shown toward ESL students in specific areas, generally the respondents indicated that they do not assess business communication assignments any differently based upon the stu dents' primary language usage. © 2002, Sage Publications.

In the first study, 39 male business clients of the company IRM Netherlands compared an authentic business proposal with a modified version that conformed to genre conventions of document structure. Readers' preferences and reading behavior were noted and observed. In the second study, the same group of IRM business clients compared fragments of proposals that differed in stylistic genre conventions. Readers' preferences were noted and verified. Results of the first study indicated that applying genre conventions to document structure improved the readers' selection of information. Results of the second study revealed that readers disapproved of persuasive style shifts, while opinions differed with respect to shifts from impersonal to personal style. © 2002 by the Association for Business Communication.""Assessing the level of improvement of students' writing competency during a semester is becoming increasingly important for business communication instructors. When conducting an assessment, instructors need to be aware of issues that will affect reliability and validity. They need to develop cleargoals at the beginning; for example, good assessment strives to improve instruction and to develop students' communication skills. Because different schools have different missions and operate in different environments, a custom-made instrument will ensure that the assessment fits the local conditions. Before con ducting the assessment, the instrument needs to be validated for specific use, and scorers must be trained in holistic scoring to reach an overall assessment.""Concurrent think-aloud protocol (CTA) is often used in usability test settings to gain insight into participants' thoughts during their task performances. This study adds to a growing body of research within technical communication that addresses the use of think-aloud protocols in usability test settings. The eye movements and verbalizations of 10 participants were recorded as they searched for information on a website. The analysis of transcripts and real-time eye movement showed that CTA is an accurate data-collection method. The researcher found that the majority of user verbalizations in the study included words, phrases, and sentences that users read from the screen. Silence and verbal fillers that occurred during CTA enabled users to assess and process information during their searches. This study demonstrates the value technical communicators add to the study of usability test methods, and the paper recommends future avenues of research. © 2010 IEEE.""This article examines the teaching of a multimodal pedagogy in an online technical communication classroom. Based on the results of an e-portfolio assessment, the authors argue that multimodality can be taught successfully in the online environment if the instructor carefully plans and scaffolds each assignment. Specifically, they argue for an increased emphasis within the technical communication classroom on teaching the e-portfolio as a genre that not only exemplifies students’ multimodal literacies but also establishes their identities as technical communicators in the 21st century. This article provides a model for teaching multimodal composition in the online technical communication classroom and calls for more scholarship on teaching the e-portfolio in the digital environment. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016."Assessing Proficiency in Engineering English"This article describes what scholarly multimedia (i.e., webtexts) are and how one teacher-editor has students compose these texts as part of an assignment sequence in her writing classes.

Communication in the global engineering world includes collaboration on cross-functional teams, virtual-project team management, and writing for multiple, complex audiences. This tutorial discusses how one small engineering school has integrated technical communication teaching and assessment throughout the curriculum with demonstrated success. The integrated curriculum, formative and summative assessments, and real-world contexts offer one model to address growing communication challenges. © 2006 IEEE.""A corpus of current editions of statistics textbooks was assessed to compare aspects and levels of readability for the topics of measures of center, line of fit, regression analysis, and regression inference. Analysis with lexical software of these text selections revealed that the large corpus can be described well by three index variables that summarize the lexical and grammatical complexity of the textbook excerpts. Assessment of those three variables indicates that substantial differences exist in the readability of the topics within textbooks with respect to lexical and grammatical complexity. This analysis suggests that general readability of introductory statistics topics within textbooks varies substantially and it is a recommendation that instructors: (1) be prepared to provide additional support for topics that are more grammatically and lexically complex, and (2) be aware that they can input their instructional materials into LexTutor VP or Coh-metrix as a quick screen for possible readability issues. © 2015, The Author(s).""The document has become one of the few tangible deliverables of intellectual capital in an information age. As the value of business and technical communication has grown, the importance of designing information to meet customers' needs has increased. This article explores the design option of channel choice or medium selection (delivering information in print or electronic form) and reports the results of two studies that examine customers' preferences and use of printed manuals and online help, common documents used in the computer software industry. Through the past several years, many businesses have been anxious to move documentation online to reduce costs. However, research has not adequately addressed how users react to print versus online documentation or whether this approach is cost effective over time, taking into account customer satisfaction, repeat sales, and other business issues. The first study reports the results of a survey of 400 users of a word-processing application and their preferences and use of printed and online documentation. The second study uses an ethnographic approach, contextual inquiry (CI), to examine 18 subjects' use of printed and online documentation in context. Results showed that users prefer different types of documentation for different types of tasks. The implications of these findings for business communication practice and research are discussed. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article argues for the long-term value of client-based group projects in an introductory technical communication course. Survey results are presented from 73 former technical communication students with two to seven years of workplace experience. Lasting five to six weeks, these projects are a compromise between a briefer conventional case method and a more lengthy individualized internship or cooperative education experience. The projects reinforce research, analysis, and reporting skills, such as interviewing specialists and conducting survey research, that graduates continue to value highly even after years of workplace writing. When framed as such, client-based projects also encourage students to define and debate public policy issues.""This three-phased study examines corporate blog use, specifically the impact and value of blogs on organizational social capital and knowledge sharing at Dell Inc., a global computer manufacturer. The impact of social-mediated Web 2.0 technologies on organizational social capital has received limited attention in scholarship, possibly because of the inevident connection to measurable economic value and newness of the technology. Our findings indicate the corporate blog can be used as a sustainable forum leading to a shared understanding of organizational roles, increased sense of group cohesiveness, improved work processes, and improved professional and personal ties among employees in the organization. © 2010 IEEE.""While researchers and instructors of technical and professional communication have embraced the importance of visual communication skills in recent years, little systematic effort has been made to develop assessment instruments that measure visual design skills. This paper presents a project that examines timed tests as a means of measuring a student's ability to solve design problems. The process and rationale for the test designs and the results of a series of empirical studies are discussed. The results of the studies suggest that timed tests can be a viable complement to the project-oriented assessment approach suggested by prior studies. © 2011 IEEE."This study investigates syllabi for evidence of the principles of writing across the curriculum (WAC) in courses offered by the Faculty of Business (FOB) at a university operating in a non-English-speaking country. The research analyzed all syllabi of FOB courses offered in the spring 2010 semester for evidence of WAC looking for indications of writing activities. The analysis focused on both expressive/informal and product/formal writing and discovered through the syllabi the intention of the instructor to incorporate writing. The findings suggest that these courses require little or no writing and therefore principles of WAC are not evident. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication."The assessment of engineering products and services is central to the work of engineering, but the evaluation of human communication and its development in engineering and other technical professions has not yet received enough attention in IEEE research and publications. This special section begins to remedy this situation by calling for more research in the assessment of professional communication skills and training programs as well as in the development of better assessment tools and procedures. It features four new articles on the topic in the hope that these will inspire even more research related to the assessment of human communication in scientific and technical professions. © 2006 IEEE.""The purpose of a functionally oriented maintenance manual (FOMM) is to improve communication by providing better visibility of the information required to support the maintenance and training tasks that are a key part of a successful system deployment. The original technical contributions that led to the FOMM concept were prepared by field engineers accustomed to working with military technicians. In this environment, all troubleshooting is accomplished by reference to schematic, wiring, and block diagrams. FOMM proved to be the best mechanism for improved diagrammatic coverage. The FOMM requirements are cited in MIL-M-24100 and other functional specifications. The diagrams require precise functional grouping; left-to-right signal flow; hardware indenture identification; definition of plugs, jacks, and intervening wiring; identification of test points and adjustments; and - above all - a Source Data block that identifies the drawing numbers and revision level of all engineering data used to generate the drawing.""The authors examine the communication problems that can arise in policy-making situations requiring public input and assent when the ethical and cultural assumptions of technical people representing a government entity differ from those of the citizen participants. Technical people often operate from an “ethic of expediency” that values clear, precise technical data as the basis for decision-making. But when citizen participants hold sharply different cultural values and interests, they may perceive such communication as privileging the interests of government over their own. Drawing on Habermas' concept of the “ideal speech situation,” the authors present a case study in which engineers representing a city government attempted to gain the assent of a minority community to a well drilling project. The study suggests that the engineers' communication, although presented in good faith, did not meet Habermas' “claims to validity” and thus was seen by community residents as ideologically distorted. Because they did not trust the communication, the residents could not enter into consensus building, and the project remains at impasse. The engineers' propensity to frame the situation as a technical space for rational decision-making, from which cultural concerns and political motives could be excluded, made them blind to reality as the citizen participants perceived it. Government representatives in such situations have an ethical obligation to observe cultural difference and to create a communicative context in which consensus-building is possible. © 1995 IEEE.""A voice mail (VM) system was pilot tested at a Canadian tar sand mining site.

To address this problem, the article presents principles for using problem-based learning to design assignments that teach students to tailor communication to the needs of audiences. The approach focuses not on specific workplace documents but on the higher order workplace practice of effectively connecting documents and presentations to audience needs, and designing communication accordingly. A two-year study of capstone design courses suggests that the approach encourages students to explicitly consider audience needs when composing. © 2006 IEEE.""Increasingly, documentation for computer systems and products addresses diverse audiences, ranging from professional computer engineers to novice readers who have never used a computer. This diversity presents a challenge to the computer documentation professional: how to address the needs of both novice and sophisticated users? Effective user documentation must be procedure-oriented: how to combine this goal with the fact that different user audiences have different goals and face different problems? A discussion is presented of the challenge of audience diversity in computer documentation. Using case studies, it reviews and recommends different ways to meet the needs of various audiences.""This study examined perceptions of 10 common fonts displayed in projected PowerPoint text slides. It investigated 37 participants’ ratings of the fonts—five serif and five sans serif—on four variables: comfortable-to-read, professional, interesting, and attractive. A significant difference was found between participants’ ratings of serif and sans serif fonts on the professional variable, but not on the other three variables. Significant differences in ratings were found among sans serif fonts on the professional and attractive variables and among the serif fonts on the professional and comfortable-to-read variables. In addition, as hypothesized, a strong correlation was found between the comfortable-to-read and the professional variables. Another strong correlation was found between the interesting and the attractive variables. The hypothesis that a negative correlation would obtain between the comfortable-to-read and the interesting variables was not borne out by the data. Technical communicators who want a font that is comfortable-to-read, professional, interesting, and attractive might choose Gill Sans, Souvenir, or fonts that share similar anatomical characteristics.""A practical methodology for translating technical papers to effective technical presentations is presented. Definitions describe the applicable meeting environment. An integrated set of visuals and associated text provide an example of a presentation while developing the methodology. Basic audience requirements (or constraints) which the presentation designer must accommodate are shown to be the very limited capacity of any audience to process and assimilate information, the need for screening the few ideas that can be transmitted, and the necessity for surmounting audience ″significance blindness″ by incorporating the ideas as thesis titles on every visual."Presents a case study in audience-driven Web site design that addresses elements of medical Web site credibility Describes a conceptual framework that identifies elements of credibility and guides our discussion of audience-driven web-design"The paper discusses crosscultural differences in audience analysis, using research conducted during a series of consulting trips in Japanese industries.

It investigates the work and communication needs of newly graduated auditors, their senior colleagues, and their managers in five MNCs (multinational companies) in Singapore. Much research indicates that accountancy graduates entering the profession are perceived to be lacking some important communication abilities. This study investigates how important auditors perceive interpersonal, oral, and written skills to be to them at different stages of their professional careers and the degree to which they perceive that they need to improve in these skills. As expected, the newly graduated audit assistants perceived the greatest need for improvement in all three skills. However, they also perceived that written skills were of lesser importance to them than interpersonal and oral skills. We suggest that accounting courses could prepare undergraduates more effectively in the oral/interpersonal skills needed in the initial stages of their auditing careers by introducing more case studies and by exploring the potential of the hypertext Internet environment to develop realistic simulations. These changes might involve the introduction of cross-disciplinary team teaching.""Faced with shrinking budgets and changing standards at their colleges and universities, instructors of business communication are looking for new ways to prepare stu dents for careers in business.

It also shows that co-authorship is increasingly common; that over time authors have chosen to cite a larger number of sources; and that authors cite a variety of sources, particularly serials. Cited serials come most often from the areas of business and economics, social sciences and education, and business communication; the patterns of serial citation were relatively stable during the surveyed period. The Journal is open to other business and communication serials, but somewhat closed to serials outside those two areas. The serials cited most often by the Journal do not cite the Journal in turn. On the other hand, some newer business communication serials cite the Journal frequently. © 1993, Sage Publications.

The renewed use of author-produced camera-ready copy is achieving real savings in production costs and some reductions in production time. The American Geophysical Union publishes one journal that is totally author-prepared, two that contain both commercially typeset and author-prepared material, and both hard cover and paperback books of completely author-prepared material. For some of these publications copy-edited manuscripts are sent to the author for preparation of the final copy. The most significant problem has been developing an instruction sheet that is clear and easy to follow and that covers most problems which may be encountered by the typist but is not so long that it will be ignored. An equally difficult problem has been the establishment of quality standards. The savings in production costs have allowed us to reduce page charges by more than half and to price books at about half the price of a comparable typeset book."Examines audience-centered writing strategies in two very early sewing machine manuals  Considers the difference between nonsexist and gender-neutral writing  Concludes that avoiding sexism in technical writing may sometimes be impossible."Professionals in the workplace are rarely asked to write autobiographical essays.

Immediate retrieval of the full document gives the user a high level of awareness. Field experience indicated that the number of keywords needed is easily manageable (less than 200) and that ease of document location was enhanced over paper-file searching in two-thirds of the attempts. The application experience is of value in introducing automated retrieval into the general office environment.""An automated text data base offers the business development staff and proposal writers a powerful tool for locating and organizing information. It allows a writer to search for specific information on particular topics of interest and to transfer the information to a file for editing and rewriting. Searches can be made for any word or combination of words in a document. Such a data base can save time and improve efficiency by making information readily available and giving writers more time for analysis and writing. In addition, the data base has applicability beyond proposal writing. It can be the repository for any textual information, such as marketing data, personnel files, technical library abstracts, legal documents, or government regulations. Any or all of this information might be tailored for marketing campaigns aside from proposal efforts. © 1988 IEEE"Recent approaches to computerized index preparation have failed to accommodate the flexible nature of index entries and could only be run on large-scale data processing systems.

Technical communicators can increase their legal literacy by learning the elements that are most easily defeated and thereby avoid subjecting their product instructions and warnings to litigation. This article surveys the existing scholarship to show the need for more attention to legal terms, theory, and practice before explaining how lawyers approach litigation. The article then turns to each of the main causes of action-the functional approach of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability, negligence, and breach of express warranty and misrepresentation-with an emphasis upon the elements that are most within the control of the technical communicator. © 2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article explores the role of students' prior, or antecedent, genre knowledge in relation to their developing disciplinary genre competence by drawing on an illustrative example of an engineering genre-competence assessment. The initial outcomes of this diagnostic assessment suggest that students' ability to successfully identify and characterize rhetorical and textual features of a genre does not guarantee their successful writing performance in the genre. Although previous active participation in genre production (writing) seems to have a defining influence on students' ability to write in the genre, such participation appears to be a necessary but insufficient precondition for genre-competence development. The authors discuss the usefulness of probing student antecedent genre knowledge early in communication courses as a potential source for macrolevel curriculum decisions and microlevel pedagogical adjustments in course design, and they propose directions for future research. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""To prepare business communication undergraduates for a changing work world and to engage today's tech-savvy students, many instructors have embraced social media by incorporating its use in the classroom.

In order to evaluate translation quality, a theoretical perspective is formulated as a basis for criteria for a good translation. In this perspective, the target text is considered an autonomous document. Two sets of criteria are distinguished: correctness errors and functional errors. The tools that were used to assess translation quality were expert analysis and reader-focused evaluation. For both tools a multilingual evaluation team was formed with the highest possible expertise in the target languages, in linguistics, and in usability.

This extended network is the structure of business communication which flows in work-related ties that organization members maintain both within the organization and across its boundary. We study the relationship between boundary-spanning communication and individual influence in a network with 108 organizational members. We find that boundary spanning correlates with influence, regardless of hierarchical level. There is also a curvilinear relationship between boundary-spanning communication and individual influence. Thus, managers need to balance their communication within and across the organizational boundary. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""In any discussion on the failure of communication, the writer usually bears the burden of criticism. But when writers have an opportunity to discuss problems of communication among themselves, one hears of uncoordinated material handed to them, unrealistic deadlines, and poor supervising personnel. Barriers to elective technical communication apply to preparation, language, time and distance, and the human element. Many professional communicators feel that there should be more company indoctrination of new writers and constant retraining of older writers. The human element is still most important in communications. A professional writer will be better trained if he acquires some knowledge of the psychology of communication and of motivation, and if he works for a large corporation he is in an essential way integrated into the scheme of things. © 1969, Sage Publications.

But it is often very difficult to actually write these segments in the same order they appear in the finished product. Instead of this linear approach, we recommend a modular approach starting with the core sections, the methods and results that researchers know best, and working backward and forward to pick up the beginnings and endings. We show how the beginning and ending sections build on the core sections and offer strategies to improve them.""With today's business environments no longer confined to national borders, much work is undertaken in global virtual teams. Such teams consist of members located in different countries that communicate via technology media to complete a project task. Much of the research in this area has been focused on the technological aspects of such environments; there is, however, a lack of research into the behavioral aspects and the issue of cultural differences in particular. It has been acknowledged that when cultural diversity is neither recognized nor acted upon, significant challenges can arise for the team. Current advice in the literature suggests that team members should adapt their normal working behavior in consideration of cultural differences. However, there is little indication of how team members should do so. This study investigated if and/or how team members adapt their behavior in cross-cultural virtual teams. The results of this study indicate that team members can adapt their behavior in both spoken and written communication as well as allowing for religious beliefs and time zone differences. This paper discusses specifically how behavior can be adapted, including a discussion of behaviors that caused concern. Finally, a framework of behavioral adaptations is presented for ways to improve cross-cultural virtual team interactions. © 2006 IEEE.""This article explains the needs for behavioral objectives, discusses their identity, gives guidelines for their preparation, and includes a self-test for for their appropriateness. © 1974, Sage Publications.

Teachers should narrow the focus of each class to one stylistic goal, such as preventing overuse of nominalizations. After explaining the goal and demonstrating alternatives, the instructor di vides the class into teams of two students apiece. One acts as primary editor and attempts to revise a set ofproblem sentences ; the other supervises the work as secondary editor, makes suggestions for improvement, and serves as a liai son with the instructor who circulates through the class, answering questions, resolving disputes, and approving or rejecting the finished set as presented by the secondary editor. This process-oriented method allows the teacher to apply several basic behavioral principles: to focus on individual students, to start with the students' naive repertory of responses and build from there, to work with freely emitted behavior, to insure frequent and brief responses, to reinforce quickly appropriate responses, and to achieve the desired behavior through sequential steps. © 1987, Sage Publications.

In this article, the authors explore internationally operating business professionals' perceptions of BELF communication and its ""success"" at work, based on selected data from an online survey (N = 987) and in-depth interviews (N = 27) conducted in European multinational companies. The findings show that BELF can be characterized as a simplified, hybridized, and highly dynamic communication code. BELF competence calls for clarity and accuracy of content (rather than linguistic correctness) and knowledge of business-specific vocabulary and genre conventions (rather than only ""general"" English). In addition, because BELF interactions take place with nonnative speakers (NNSs) from a variety of cultural backgrounds, the relational orientation is perceived as integral for BELF competence. In sum, BELF competence can be considered an essential component of business knowledge required in today's global business environment. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""As a growing and integral part of America's corporate workforce, technical writers increasingly share general employee benefits and burdens. Negative trends that affect the workforce in many companies now threaten serious damage to the teams that technical writers work on, the projects they develop, and ultimately the revenues that pay their salaries.

It is a writer's workbook, a collection of translations, paraphrases, and loosely organized memorable passages from the masters of rhetoric Jonson admired. It is suggested that today's professional communicator may add Jonson to the list of master rhetoricians and find useful advice in Timber on such pertinent matters as the nature of language, writing and style, speaking, and leadership.""Benchmarking is rapidly becoming a standard business practice used by organizations to improve their quality in specific areas.

However, misunderstandings among team members can lead to poor performance, hurt feelings, and lack of motivation to attack subsequent tasks. A common source of such misunderstandings is miscommunication caused by differences in how people interpret everyday words and phrases. Team members might interpret these differences as a natural occurrence of group work, if they notice them at all. Research questions: We seek to answer two research questions regarding miscommunication within teams: (1) Can a communication exercise create awareness among team members of the danger of miscommunication? (2) What benefits do team members gain from the exercise? Situating the case: We describe a classroom exercise that relies on an integrative model for improving communication within teams. We also present evidence of the exercise's effectiveness in raising awareness and fostering accommodation and social learning among team members. Our approach is similar to that used in other cases. How this case was studied: We used 13 teams from three classes during the course of a regular semester. A communication exercise we have used for many years was conducted as part of team formation activities early in the semester. Team discussions regarding exercise results formed the basis for team members to analyze their communication during the semester. About the case: A significant variance of understanding among people as to the meaning of several of the focal terms can lead to suboptimal outcomes for any given work the team is tasked to achieve. In this case, we describe a study designed to improve communication among team members and, thus, lessen the likelihood of such a negative outcome. Results: Team members reported better awareness of communication issues and improved team functioning as a result of having completed the exercise. Conclusion: We find that a shared understanding of terminology is an important part of training leaders and managers to help teams reduce common miscommunication problems in the workplace. © 2016 IEEE.""Technical communication courses and curricula are appearing in more and more college catalogs as recognition of the profession grows. To assist colleges in the development of such offerings, the curriculum development subcommittee of STC's (Society for Technical Communication) Education and Development Committee asked practicing technical communicators what the schools should teach. Three major conclusions can be drawn from the survey. 1. There is support among professional technical comunicators and educators for existing technical communication programs. And the consensus is that there is a need for more. 2. Existing and future programs should include subject areas which give experience in both science/engineering and written/graphic communications. In addition, the noncommunication subject areas should include courses in several technical areas to give the students a broad background, and the communication courses should include equal amounts of theory and methods. 3. Specific noncommunication courses should include, in the following order, courses in: A. Engineering; B. Mathematics; C. Business; D. Physical and natural science; E. Humanities. Specific communication course areas should include, in order: A. Editing; B. Communications research methods; C. Technical drawing; D. Business communications; E. Printing, bindery, platemaking, distribution.""Traditional textbook rationales for the technical writing course locate the essence of technical writing in objectivity, clarity, and neutrality, and the need for teaching it in its usefulness to employers. Such rationales, however, are unable to accommodate a notion of ethics and responsibility: if the writer merely serves the interests that employ her by reporting facts in an objective way, how can she exercise choice when ethical problems arise? An alternative view is to see technical writing as always rhetorical and involved with potentially conflicting agendas and interests, with objectivity, clarity, and neutrality serving merely as stylistic devices in the writer's rhetorical toolbox. Technical writers are rhetoricians who continually make ethical choices in serving diverse interests and negotiating between conflicting demands. The recognition of the fundamental rhetoricity of technical writing is the first step towards accommodating a meaningful notion of ethics into the technical writing curriculum. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

One organization a small manufacturing firm in the Southeast, and members of a selected cross-functional project team consented to have a researcher present during the life cycle of a single project. Reflections based on the resulting case study highlight three overarching areas of concern in cross-functional designs: first, equity as an evolving blueprint for project-team work; second, trust as the foundation upon which solid progress depends; and third, authority as the visible framework of the process and products of the team's work. © 1991 IEEE""This article provides the author's response to an article that examined pervious research he conducted that presented a communication model. The author notes that the comment provided several useful contributions; however, there were a variety of points that he disagreed with. He disagrees with the author's inclusion of new emotion, knowledge/belief and interest/desire links in the model, arguing that the communication process results form operational activities of decision making and behavior processes. ""Construed narrowly, “usability testing of documentation” can be limited to validating the usability of a nearly completed draft. This paper explores ways that technical communication can take a broader view of usability and then situate new approaches and studies. Appropriately situated, this broader interpretation can give technical communicators ways to talk with others interested in usability and can build a platform for an understanding of usability research that looks beyond “testing drafts for usability” to the tough issues driving usability research. © 1989 IEEE""Developing effective workplace safety and risk communication materials for Latino construction workers poses a challenge for technical communicators. These workers are at a disadvantage because of culture and language differences on many job sites. Furthermore, low levels of literacy in any language and lack of proper training compound their job site communication problems. This article builds on cultural studies-based recommendations to develop discourse in workplace safety and risk that these workers can fully understand. The authors in this study used direct creative input from Latino construction workers in order to create safety and risk communication products that were evaluated as effective and culturally relevant for these workers and their peers. © The Author(s) 2012.""This essay describes and provides a rationale for the Rhetoric of Negotiation as a useful frame for what is typically considered persuasion in business communication. It argues for a broader understanding of the opposition and draws from Eckhouse's work on business communication as a competitive activity as well as Booth's concept of Win-Rhetoric versus Listening-Rhetoric. Using illustrations from the author's previous research, this commentary proposes that the Rhetoric of Negotiation is useful in business communication for both ethical and practical reasons. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Before a jury begins deliberation, judges provide instructions to guide jury decisionmaking. Unfortunately, extant literature has demonstrated poor comprehension of these instructions. Although there have been attempts to simplify the language of these instructions, plain language may not be enough to ensure comprehension. Instead, the principles of technical communication advocate the adoption of a learnercentered perspective and suggest increased novice-expert interactions to assist jurors in comprehending the task assigned to them. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""By examining computer-related courses and faculty rationales for offering such courses, this article broadly examines how and why we commonly use computers in technical communication classrooms, and in what ways our current instruction may or may not move beyond skill building to include literacy and humanistic issues. It then broadly outlines three pedagogical challenges that lie ahead as we use computer technologies to support our teaching efforts over this decade and during the next century. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This has tended to decontextualize and generalize the findings and therefore overlooks the inevitably temporally and locally situated nature of all social activity. Using conversation analysis as a methodology and videotaped data of naturally occurring talk, this article seeks to go beyond such taxonomies of influence. More specifically, this article seeks to provide a fine-grained analysis of how subordinates, as well as superiors, can influence decision-making episodes of talk. It is also argued that the results of such research can be fed back into practice and ultimately can be of help in allowing better decision-making practices.""This case study examined the extent to which expected Gen Y traits surfaced in a well-managed U.S. company. The results indicate that certain Gen Y traits typically regarded as undesirable in the workplace are especially persistent, even in an optimal organizational setting, but others are not. The findings also reveal both expected and unexpected attitudes on the part of the Gen X and Boomer employees and managers. Such studies can help us move beyond generational stereotyping to more accurate, context-sensitive advice about cross-generational communication. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""As more business writing instructors begin implementing collaborative writing and learning in their classrooms, few descriptions exist that show how collaboration might work in the context of an entire course. This article describes a course that integrates individual and collaborative group assignments while requiring students to work through multiple drafting processes involving teacher and peer intervention. The course was designed to encourage students to become self-reflective, flexible writers who can make themselves aware of their writing processes and then adapt them to both individual and collaborative writing tasks. Along with outlining specific assignments and the rationales behind them, we address issues such as establishing collaborative groups, analyzing group dynamics and writing processes, and the roles teachers might play in a collaborative classroom. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Current approaches to teaching audience consideration serve a valuable preliminary function, but result in a static conception of audience that does not help students handle problems during composing. Students need a more articulate 'other self' - a more dynamic construct of audience - and the use of reading protocols in technical writing classes may help develop it. Reading protocols are taped records of a person reading a text aloud and saying whatever comes to mind during the process. The objective is to record the reader's coming to an understanding of the text, or the failure to do so. For teaching increased audience awareness, reading protocols should be performed by students themselves on papers written for the class audience. After transcription, listening to and discussion of protocols, students should revise their papers, trying to achieve a more flexible portrait of the audience. Classroom application of reading protocols may extend students' awareness of audience beyond prewriting, and may also contribute to the theory of how audience considerations affect the reading and writing processes.""Engineers and scientists can benefit by writing articles for the nontechnical media, submitting article ideas to news media editors, and appearing on radio and TV talk shows. This paper provides an overview of the media market, focusing on the publications that are interested in contributions from engineers and scientists. It discusses how to develop story ideas, contact editors, and work with professional writers and public affairs practitioners.""To optimize learning to write like engineers, undergraduate engineering students need to develop a conscious awareness of alternative writing practices and their strengths and limitations in different contexts, something that is unlikely to come about either in the workplace alone or in one writing course alone. Needed, then, is an engineering curriculum with writing integrated throughout. What follows is a case study of one attempt to integrate writing throughout the curriculum in a department of civil and environmental engineering. This department's ""beyond WI to department-wide"" model of writing is still in the early stages; the case study is less a textual account of writing outcomes than it is an account of the sociohistoric institutional conditions that led to the creation of this model and of the reasons for rejecting a model of writing instruction that relies on only two or three writing courses. The model in the case study is contrasted with other models. © 2008 IEEE.""The use of audiovisual materials, graphics, acoustics, special effects, and the like, to enhance, supplement, or even supplant the lecture, paper, or standard written/oral forms of communication has become increasingly important in today's technologically oriented business world. Available products and new developments offer both a challenge and a satisfaction that can be highly advantageous to the classroom situation. Students profit with increased learning and often a more avid interest in communication studies; teachers profit by having interested, involved students and the satisfaction that comes with employing up-to-the-minute resources and materials. (Examples of films for use in teaching communications classes are cited. )""This collection of thirty-six articles exposes the problem and the promise of historical research in technical writing. The central problem is that historical research in technical writing has too often been focused only on celebrated authors or scientists as technical writers. The central promise contained in some very recent essays is that historical research in technical communications is beginning to consider the slow evolution of technical communication taking place across a broad spectrum of both celebrated and uncelebrated writers. This historical approach, though more difficult to carry out, is immensely more accurate and meaningful. Each citation includes an annotation by the compiler or indicates that it is an abstract provided by the original author.""A bibliography is presented of works related to a theory of interpersonal communication, including ""Persuasion: How Opinions and Attitudes Are Changed,"" by Herbert I.

This article briefly discusses the journal articles and book chapters we felt offered sound advice on fifteen topics relevant to writing original research results for publication. © 1993 IEEE"The literature on education in technical writing has grown at such a rapid rate in recent decades that teachers have trouble keeping up with it. This bibliography identifies 15 books (no texts) and 100 articles published between 1978 and 1983, all of them dealing directly with education."This is a 'starter' bibliography for those who would like to read further into the field of management communications.

Associated issues that were examined included the employees' level of stress, job satisfaction and commitment; their feelings of personal control; and their opinions regarding management's use of information gathered through monitoring. Results or the study indicated that, contrary to many reports, computer monitoring can be positive when used correctly and accompanied with effective management communication. Employees' levels of stress were negatively correlated with their feelings of job satisfaction, personal control, commitment to the organization, and the employees' feelings about the appropriateness of the way in which their managers used the information gathered by monitoring. These results highlight the importance of the responsible use of monitoring, the significance of communication, and the value of recognizing and rewarding good performance. © 1994 IEEE.""Big data is one of the most hyped buzzwords in both academia and industry. This article makes an early contribution to research on big data by situating data theoretically as a historical object and arguing that much of the discourse about the supposed transparency and objectivity of big data ignores the crucial roles of interpretation and communication. To set forth that analysis, this article engages with recent discussion of big data and “smart” cities to show the communicative practices operating behind the scenes of large data projects and relate those practices to the profession of technical communication. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""Two research traditions inform contemporary technical communication research. With its physical science orientation and organizational capaciousness, the tradition of Big Science originated in the laboratory of Ernest O. Lawrence. With its humanistic orientation and individualistic singularity, the tradition of bricolage was identified in the fieldwork of Claude Lévi-Strauss. The current celebration of the former in technical communication research serves to reify a power-driven impulse for utility. The two cultures that result from such an impulse - the organizational professional and the academic researcher - have little common ground for research. To interrupt such harmful dynamics, an orientation to research is offered that celebrates successful past work in technological innovation, information design, the communication process, and the ways those processes emerge in specific contexts. To foster the continuation of such research, a community-based model is offered that draws its strength from the tradition of the bricoleur. © 2005 IEEE.""Many factors, such as word choice, organization, suitability to reader and discourse community, and numerous other rhetorical considerations, influence readers' perception of ""good writing."" The factor provoking instant and powerful abreaction from a reader, however, is often a perceived error in grammar or usage. This study tests the extent to which business executives and business communication academics were bothered by selected examples of these questionable usage elements. Results show usage elements that troubled readers most were basic sentence-structure errors such as run-ons, fragments, nonparallel structure, and danglers. Several usage errors, such as the use of ""disinterested"" for ""uninterested"" and the use of qualifiers with absolutes such as ""unique,"" may be in transition to acceptability. The error of completing a linking verb with an adverbial clause troubled few. Executive readers were bothered less by the questionable usage elements, overall, than academic readers, and younger readers less than older readers. Acknowledging to students that usage changes, clarifying differences between written and spoken dialects, and exemplifying and explaining the most bothersome errors (using a minimum of traditional grammar terminology) can help students overcome some writing weaknesses. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""The authors present a rationale for the adoption of a periodic communica tion audit at the organizational level.

Haldane, in attempting to show connections between Marxist political theory and Darwinian evolutionary theory, blurs the generic characteristics of political and scientific discourse.

Two years of careful planning by the Association's Division Two (Teaching) and its Publications and Communications Board resulted in the initiation of Teaching of Psychology (ToP) in October 1974. Although it was originally planned as a joint venture for two years, with a transfer to the parent society if successful, recent agreements now permit ToP to remain as a divisional journal. There appears to be a developing need and support for divisional journals as supplemental to primary journals but integrated into a systematic communication network for the discipline of psychology.""The decision to create a new journal starts - or should start - with the determination of the need for a new, separate, and continuing forum for the interchange of information within a discipline or field. Critical criteria include the choice of editor and editorial board; estimates of the amount of material to be published; assessment of the total potential audience and of the probable percent capture; direct costs (which vary with the publishing organization); and the subscription price. Other factors include growth potential, society support, page charges, reprint sales, advertising sales, and patience.""Commonly used essay grading procedures are subjective and suffer from incon sistency and instability.

In major Chinese hospitals, the young generation of clinical doctors, especially those who hold a doctoral degree, is commonly expected to stay research-active. The study reported in this article was conducted at a major hospital in East China, featuring a group of orthopedic surgeons for whom there is an SCI-publication requirement. The study draws upon cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) to illuminate the medical doctors' boundary crossing between clinical and research activity systems. Based on analyses of observations, interviews with 11 research-active doctors, and 2 weeks of activity logs kept by three of the doctors, the article demonstrates how the doctors take the advantage of rich clinical data for research purposes and how they ""squeeze time"" for research. © 2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The controversy about vaccines and autism presents an opportunity to explore how science is constructed in public debates about health and medicine. Rhetors who argue against a connection between vaccines and autism insist that their opponents are irrational, while rhetors arguing for a link insist that their fears are rational indeed. This analysis poses an alternative way of understanding the vaccines-autism controversy, suggesting that it is partly fueled by differing perceptions of the boundary between science and non-science. Using the concept of boundary work as a lens, this article uses generative rhetorical criticism to examine artifacts within the controversy and explores rhetorical constructions of scientific evidence, the forum of scientific discourse, scientific expertise, and the scientific capability. The findings suggest that rhetors' awareness of disciplinary boundaries is just as important in the construction and reception of their arguments as their knowledge of scientific facts and principles. © The Author(s) 2015.""The article advises leaders of prospective brainstorming sessions how to achieve the synergistic effects they seek. To prepare for the session requires that the leader use two easel pads, with two people as recorders, marking pens, and masking tape (to display the ideas generated). Once the session starts, the leader should be prepared to (1) restate ideas for the recorders, (2) ask for clarification, and (3) overcome the inevitable lull. After generating as many alternatives as possible, the group is asked to evaluate the ideas by ranking, debating, and discussing. Abuses, misuses, and limitations on brainstorming are offered."Certain translation agencies that insist on the anonymity of their freelance translators are the subject of this article.

In response, law schools have significantly increased the skills-based components in their curricula, and most state bar exams now include a performance test. Technical and Professional Communication (TPC) programs already provide substantial instruction in all of the skills and values described in the MacCrate Report; further, an education in TPC prepares graduates to excel in law school and on the bar exam. This knowledge offers opportunities for growth if educators, administrators, and scholars take steps to encourage students to consider not only writing for but also joining in the legal profession.""This study explores how employees accounted for their engagement in circumvention (i.e., dissenting by going around or above one's supervisor). Employees completed a survey instrument in which they provided a dissent account detailing a time when they chose to practice circumvention. Results indicated that employees accounted for circumvention through supervisor inaction, supervisor performance, and supervisor indiscretion. In addition, findings revealed how employees framed circumvention in ways that enhanced the severity and principled nature of the issues about which they chose to dissent. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""Technical communication consultants steeped in conventional academic notions of writing pedagogy may encounter different assumptions about the nature of writing and the significance of grammar in writing instruction when they consult with professional engineers. This paper examines historical, theoretical, and practical reasons for these sometimes contradictory beliefs and traces the authors' efforts to reconcile these differences while planning and conducting a writing seminar for an engineering firm. A strong emphasis on grammar and mechanics can lead to numerous benefits, including a stronger sense of shared purpose between consultants and engineers and a point of entry into additional conversations about institutional writing practices and writing environments. © 2006 IEEE.""It has long been one of the central principles of certain writing teachers that good writing consists of short sentences, ad, in general, of conciseness.

The most important finding was that over one-third of the respondents misidentified (out of five compounds given them) at least one headword—syntactically, the last noun in the compound. We therefore recommend: (1) Students, as readers, be reminded of the headword's importance and (2) nominal compounds be employed for clearer understanding only following their syntactically fuller forms (including prepositions, verbals, etc.) in a manner similar to that employed for acronyms. © 1991, Sage Publications.

In this article, I call for that kind of continuity not only in pedagogy but also in research. Explaining the value of connections in pedagogy and research between composition and professional communication studies, I conclude with various questions and avenues for further research. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

What is lacking in the scholarship is a discussion of how to successfully link these two ideas. To help teachers implement courses that bridge the gap between service-learning projects and internships, I discuss how to design a course in technical communication that actively prepares students for subsequent internships with nonprofit agencies. In specific, I outline social development and social learning theories, service-learning pedagogies, and lesson plans and assignments that integrate these theories into practice. This project serves as a model that insists that the teacher first instructs students regarding not only rhetorical aspects of document design, including audience awareness and style, but also in placing the students in internships and designing assignments to be fulfilled in internship roles. The combination of classroom practices with an internship supports the idea that students learn the value of the process of writing, including the social embeddedness that can often influence their writing. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The workplace is becoming increasingly diverse in ways that are changing our understanding of who our readers are and how we can make effective communication choices to bridge the gaps between us. Communication problems arise because of differences in world experience, in the amount of common knowledge shared within cultures, in the structure of societies and the workplace, in culturally specific rhetorical strategies, and even in differences in processing graphics. Most textbooks provide little information on these topics, so the technical writing teacher needs to find ways to incorporate issues of international and multicultural communication into the classroom. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Outdoor programs provide a framework for organizations to improve teamwork, problem solving, risk-taking, self-esteem, and interpersonal communication. The advantages of outdoor-based programs include high participation in learning by trainees, opportunity to experience real emotions and adopt new pat terns of thinking, ability to promote experimentation in problem solving, and pro motion of group awareness and trust. Many advantages of outdoor education can be maintained when a program goes indoors. Indoor adaptations are safe and nondiscriminatory; they can be conducted anywhere regardless of weather, can facilitate easier transfer of learning to the workplace, and are less expensive. Using the outdoor model, teachers can devise challenge activities for classroom use. Such activities provide variety and the opportunity for experiential learning in the business communication classroom.""This article introduces a new IText technology called Classroom Salon.

Creating an Advisory Board is one way to forge this alliance. This article describes how such a board was created, the influence it had upon program development, and the insights both industry and academia gained from this alliance. Although industry and academia are not the same, both had overlapping goals: to develop a symbiotic relationship that would provide students and faculty with the technological expertise practicing technical communicators could offer, but, at the same time, to provide a construct true to the missions of a liberal education. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Users primarily look to ReadMe files for information on software bugs. They identify the following ways that software manufacturers can improve their ReadMe files: 1) keep them short, 2) include a table of contents, 3) use hypertext, and 4) eliminate the need for ReadMe files. Along with these four improvements, this article discusses other ways to create quality ReadMe files that meet concrete user needs.""Traditionally, research about collaboration in business communication classes has focused on small-group interaction and peer review of documents. Yet, computer classrooms and electronic networks used for teaching business communication today are affecting how traditional collaboration works and are opening up new possibilities for collaborative activity. One exciting possibility is using network technology to promote collaboration beyond the four walls of a single classroom.

Not only do children represent a growing segment of Internet users, much of what they do online has a specifi c education. To help technical communicators create educational Web sites for children, we offer a set of guidelines to direct the design process. Method: Nine children participated in a usability test of the CARES Playground, an educational Web site geared toward 7- to 9-year-olds. The site was designed by a group of graduate students in professional writing based on a review of the (admittedly limited) literature dealing with designing Web sites for children. This paper matches common themes from existing literature to the results of the usability tests. Results: Since all the information on designing Web sites for children emerged from the literature of designing Web sites for adults, the themes of navigation, appearance, and content are not unfamiliar. However, the interpretation of those common issues for children-as well as the children's reaction to them-may be surprising. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be conscious and deliberate when designing Web sites for children. To ensure that educational Web sites are able to meet their learning goals, careful consideration of children's developmental abilities and Web preferences must be considered. We present several guidelines as a starting point, though further research is needed to confi rm and expand upon them.""This article provides a taxonomy of, nomenclature for; and discussion of issues related to collaborative writing. The goal is to enhance its research, improve its application in academia and industry, and help produce technologies that better support collaborative writing. To write collaboratively and build supportive technologies, practitioners and academics need to use a consistent nomenclature and taxonomy of collaborative writing.

This article stresses that effective choices in group awareness, participation, and coordination are critical to successful collaborative writing outcomes, and that these outcomes may be promoted through collaborative writing software, chat software, face-to-face meetings, and group processes. © 2004 by the Association for Business Communication."Examines current demographics of Web usage and the challenges they reveal  Provides guidance for creating World Wide Web content for international audiences  Addresses what can be achieved by making the World Wide Web a truly international medium."In this article, the authors answer the call of the IText manifesto to use ITexts to explore fundamental issues of writing, describing instant messaging (IM) as a form of interactive networked writing (INW) and showing how IM writers discursively construct contexts. Specifically, they argue that writers use (a) deixis to build and maintain material contexts and (b) intertextuality to construct sociocultural contexts. Four intact IM transcripts were coded for instances of four kinds of deixis-space, time, person, and object-and for instances of intertextuality. Results showed that IM writers use all four kinds of deixis and that deictic elements made up almost 10% of the total words of the transcripts. In addition, two kinds of intertextual elements-direct quotation and cultural referents-were used to invoke, build, and sometimes undermine social and cultural contexts. The authors also discuss some of the material affordances and constraints of writing and conclude by arguing that INW is literally dialogic.© The Author(s) 2011.""Describes how to catapult your message off the page immediately and clearly* Shows how to complement the structure and content of the writing by the way the type looks and the layout is organized""A field's identity and sustainability depend on its research as well as on programs, practice, and infrastructure. Research and practice have a reciprocal relationship, with practice identifying research questions and researchers answering those questions to improve practice. Technical communication research also has an exploratory purpose, using the knowledge and methods of the field to explain how texts work in a variety of contexts. A gap between research and practice developed in the 1990s. Defining explicitly how the parts of our research and our practice connect to form a whole will give the field a stronger identity. © The Author(s) 2015.""Approaching genres as knowledge structures provides a useful theoretical basis for teaching students to communicate across cultures. The approach is based on the concept of schemata (Rumelhart, 1980; Cook, 1994) and on Swales's (1990) techniques for genre analysis. It is divided into four interrelated teaching stages: background information, communicative purposes, text structure, and the implica tions of genre comparisons. Among the four stages, teaching the communicative purposes is the most important. This approach has been used effectively to teach students how to write sales letters in English and Chinese. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Problem forums are designed to scaffold project team discussions of rhetorical, technical, or collaborative difficulties that have unexpectedly slowed or halted their work. Problem forums are thus intended to facilitate and sustain continual learning on project teams. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.""Many studies have examined organizations’ use of specific types of online media, but few studies have examined how organizations generate dialogues and develop relationships by using multiple online communication platforms. This study takes an integrated approach by examining how top global organizations incorporate brand Web sites, Facebook, and Twitter to cultivate relationships with stakeholders. Its findings suggest that those particular online media are used similarly, that is, more for information dissemination than user engagement and more for one-way than two-way communication. The findings also suggest that the types of products promoted can affect the way that organizations use different online media to develop relationships. © The Author(s) 2015""By drawing on the in-class work of an ongoing literacy outreach project, this paper explains how well-chosen technical writing activities can earn a place in high school science courses by enabling underperforming students (including English as a second language [ESL] students) to learn science more effectively. We adapted basic research-based text-design and usability techniques into age-appropriate exercises and cases using the cognitive apprenticeship approach. This enabled high school students, aided by explicit guidelines, to build their cognitive maturity, learn how to craft good instructions and descriptions, and apply those skills to better note taking and technical talks in their science classes. © 2006 IEEE.""This paper presents a study of trust development in online courses. It reviews the concept of swift trust and examines changes in faculty roles as professors go online. An exploratory content analysis looks at indicators of the development of swift trust in the highest rated of a large number of online courses studied over a three-year period, and contrasts these results with one of the poorest-rated online courses. Establishing swift trust at the beginning of an online course appears to be related to subsequent course success. Strategies for trust formation are also suggested.""Report writing teachers will be interested in this critique of a study (the Bundy Report) to determine whether New York City schools should be decentralized.

Although much scholarship about invention in technical communication exists, it consists mainly of heuristics, checklists, ethical considerations, and audience awareness. Part of invention is using basic strategies to prepare the communicator to assess any communication situation and its context and to generate the appropriate discourse. Rhetorician Kenneth Burke's theories of dialectic and rhetoric are a twentieth-century version of this; this article explains important Burkean strategies such as etymological extension, limits of agreement with the thesis, finding the complex in the simple, expanding the circumference, translation or alembication, the four master tropes, and the pentad, and it shows how to apply these in technical communication. The article closes with a classroom assignment that uses Burkean invention strategies. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This biographical essay deals with recent literature in French dealing with the topics of communications in the firm, the company press, public relations, labor and industrial relations.""This article considers business communication's current and potential borrowing from composition studies as well as the constraints on such borrowing. It uses a citation analysis and a study of the arguments in business communication articles published in The Journal of Business Communication to identify the current state of composition's impact on research in business writing. After exploring the factors that may impede ad ditional borrowing from composition, it discusses three major areas of composition studies that may profitably influence research in business communication: the historical and theoretical study of composition as a discipline, multicultural and literacy studies, and contemporary critical and social theory. © 1993, Sage Publications.

One reason for this omission may be that theories of communication are grounded in Western cultural assumptions. Communication theorizing assumes that human symbol use differentiates humans from nature. Nature is defined as hierarchically beneath human symbol use and therefore ignored. Organizational scholarship has theorized business as it relates to the natural environment but has not thoroughly understood how communication functions in this relationship. Because organizational practice cannot ignore the natural environment, and business communication focuses on business problems, business communication is situated to fill this gap by drawing on past approaches to business communication and by adopting a Gaian perspective from which to consider alternative business and organizational arrangements. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""The article discusses the move of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah to accept business communication as a general education course as part of its competency-based approach to general education.

To determine if the business school at a small comprehensive university provides sufficient intercultural communication training, feedback from two surveys and an interview with the international business (IB) coordinator were analysed. Results revealed that the business school has implemented a multicomponent IB concentration, but that business language initiatives were unsustainable because of inadequate administrative commitment.

Its main argument is that immersion in corporate culture before class makes business communication training not only more authentic but also produces richer in-class discussions, ultimately leading to a level of metacognition associated with deep learning. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""The current standard of prose style promoted by prominent business communications texts is too narrow to accommodate the diversity of situations in business. These texts present a minimal range of stylistic choice and so limit the flexibility and individuality of the writer. An alternative form of the plain style was pioneered by Greek rhetoricians, who insisted on extending the range of options open to writers of even the simplest prose. This expanded version of the plain style is based on the cardinal principles of clarity and conciseness, butit also allows for a repertoire of dictional, syntactic, and figurative choices that make one's prose livelier and more persuasive. This expanded notion of the plain style has already generated considerable interest and promises to radically alter both the writing and teaching of business prose. © 1987, Sage Publications.

The data is based on videotaped and audio taped recordings, post-exercise debriefings and discussions, and post-exercise written reflections on two decision-making exercises. The business-related Carter Racing exercise, which imitates the developments leading to the space shuttle Challenger catastrophe, produced conclusion-driven groupthink in every multicultural group of students. The students' shared ""business-is- takingrisks"" frame of reference was salient, with few cultural differences within the groups. In contrast, an exercise requiring the same students to decide the appropriate degree of subordinate participation in decision-making when a nuclear power plant needed repair produced only one example of conclusion-driven discourse. Analyses of three groups illustrates (a) an example of groupthink (Austrians and Swedes) in both exercises, (b) an example of national culture interference (Austrians and Swedes) that paralyzed group decision-making and (c) an example of national culture interference (Austrians and Finns) that demonstrated the importance of a ""cultural negotiator"" in finding common ground for different national assumptions about social relationships and preferences for communication styles. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""Many of the earliest business and administrative letters written in English followed a set of rules called the ars dictaminis, a formal and complex model that prescribed a certain writing style and organization. The necessary pattern of organization was the following: address, salutation, notification, exposition, dispo-sition, valediction, and attestation and date. The dictamen almost completely dis-appears in the sixteenth century. Did the dictamen disappear suddenly? If so, why? In this paper, I argue that the dictamen disappeared slowly by attrition over the hundred years previous, and further, that it was never universal, as previous scholars have argued. The evidence for the claim that the dictamen was widely used and suddenly disappeared consists mostly of Chancery and government docu-ments. When we take into account the mass of business documents involving ordi-nary business people, including the largest surviving collection of business docu-ments in English before 1500, the Cely papers, we see that by the late fifteenth century, ordinary business people were not following the dictamen's conventions. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""The author emphasizes the speech writer's need to consider how words will sound when spoken.

Face-to-face communication is commonly assumed to be superior to all other forms of communication, yet face-to-face communication does not cope well with organizational constraints such as time pressure or the geographic distribution of team members. A partial answer in overcoming some of these constraints may be computer-mediated asynchronous communication (CMAC). CMAC enables increased and more equal team member participation, offers flexibility over time and distance, creates time for additional reflection and thought by participants, and archives a permanent record of all discussion. CMAC overcomes some of the drawbacks common to face-to-face communication in some circumstances, thus enhancing organizational communication, team collaboration, and decision-making effectiveness. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communication.""Writing skill is an important element in engineering success. To supplement engineering curricula that provide little help in developing writing ability, this article describes ten steps in report writing that apply to research reports, operation manuals, proposals, and feasibility studies. The steps are (1) analyze your audience; (2) classify the report; (3) design the report; (4) do the research; (5) write a rough draft of the body of the report; (6) write a conclusions section; (7) write an introduction; (8) write an executive summary or abstract; (9) revise the report; and (10) add missing elements.""Technology informs many aspects of our lives. Many critics perceive technology as a system of values, seeing it as an incomplete “ethic.” I explore the converse. Using Ellul's technique (translated as “technologism”), I ask, Can ethics be technologized? I show how the Challenger disaster delimits the range of technologism with regard to ethics. Collecting additional technical information cannot of itself prevent ethical lapses. Furthermore, the investigations implicitly show the assumption that technologism can apply to ethics in their call for additional procedures. The recognition that procedures already in place were adequate, however, shows this assumption to be fallacious. I also show that trying to technologize ethics is a recent instance of an old reductive fallacy. The ancient sophists were criticized for trying to technologize both rhetoric and ethics. In recent philosophy, too, many critics insist that ethics cannot be reduced, systematized, or technologized. Ethics then is innately problematic, so ethical choices must always be continually deliberated among people in an indeterminate way. © 1995 IEEE.""The enhancement of communication skills among engineering students has been a focus within the engineering curriculum for many years. Despite this emphasis, continual published reports document that engineering graduates are not well versed in the areas of written and oral communication when they graduate and transition into industrial-based positions. This study focuses on examining whether game-based pedagogy could serve as a potential tool for enhancing the written and oral communication skills of engineering undergraduates. Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between communication game exposure and oral and written communication skills achievement in engineering students? (2) Do engineering students' perceptions of their oral and written communication skills development associated with participation in communication games align with their achievement in these areas? Literature review: This study examines the ability of games to enhance engineering student communication skills by using the lens of activity theory. This communication theory was chosen because it describes how the creation of a piece of communication goes beyond traditional features such as grammar and syntax to include grappling with the objective or goal of the work, the system within which the product must be completed, and the methods selected to subdivide the work. These same constraints were imposed on the students within this study, in which they were assigned a technical design report and infomercial (or elevator pitch) to assess their oral and written communication skills. Methodology: Three groups of a sophomore-level Introduction to Chemical Product Design course compared non-games, games, and games-plus instructional methods. Student design reports and infomercials were scored by two analysts using reliable and validated rubrics. Team-based performance scores for each of the three sections were compared to determine whether any resulting differences in communication achievement were associated with the incorporation of game-based activities within the classroom. Students' perceptions of their communication skill development were measured through survey instruments and focus groups. The focus group data were content-analyzed by the same two analysts using a coding scheme developed from an emergent qualitative analysis of the focus group data. Results and conclusion: We found that the use of game-based pedagogy within engineering classes can enhance oral and written communication skills even though this method of instruction is not always perceived by students as relevant to their achievement in these areas. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Hofstede's cultural dimensions model has been widely used as a basic explanatory and predictive model in a variety of business studies, including studies addressing information management and electronic communication issues. This study aimed at assessing Hofstede's model by looking into a key issue for information management and electronic communication-information overload. The study compared information overload-related data from the US and New Zealand. The sample involved 108 MBA students who held professional or management positions. Data analyses employed comparisons of means and partial least squares (PLS)-based structural equation modeling techniques. Information overload perceptions in the two countries appear to differ significantly. This finding seems to be inconsistent with the relatively small differences in cultural dimension scores between the US and New Zealand, and with those two countries being placed in the same country cluster in Hofstede's model. The results call into question the adequacy of Hofstede's model as a basis to explain information management phenomena. © 2008 IEEE.""The article discusses accusations that teachers are contributing to the decline in the writing skills of business students by encouraging them to write in a style that is too heavy and pedantic.

Wiki-based collaborative content creation enables new communication practices and thereby challenges several assumptions of existing media choice theories. Method: Analysis of empirical evidence from 32 published case descriptions and reports to evaluate wiki technology in a corporate context based on the defining characteristics of three media choice theories (i.e., media richness theory, theory of media synchronicity, and common ground theory). Results: Wikis meet or exceed capabilities of several other communication and collaboration media, and thus provide a credible alternative to other business communication technologies currently in use. Further, distinct media capabilities of wikis are not fully represented by current media choice theories, suggesting the need to extend media choice theories to recognize these unique capabilities. Conclusion: The unique features of enterprise wikis enable new collaboration practices and challenge some of the core theoretical assumptions of media choice theories. The refactoring capability of wikis is identified as a unique feature that enables new forms of collaboration and communication in organizations. An implementation that wishes to successfully leverage wiki-enabled collaboration opportunities must carefully consider challenges of human interaction such as free-riding, or conflict of values.""This commentary focuses exclusively on problems of discrimination as a major obstruction in managing diversity and incorporates an experiential training exercise for con fronting discrimination to better understand the difficulties in “going beyond equality” in managing diversity.

Prominent in the first category are (a) the fact that people are seldom persuaded by reason if they have an opposing emotional commitment and (b) the amount of information remembered from a speech may be inversely proportional to the amount presented. On the practical side, a speech writer must cope with everyone who wants to get into the act between the writer and the speaker.

This article looks at several of those changes: making information more appealing to the eye, so that the reader is motivated to start reading the book; Making information easier to retrieve, so that the reader does not need to wade through unneeded information; Helping the reader learn faster, by providing tutorials, quick-path manuals, and books of models.""In response to a mail survey of the career opportunities programs offer teachers of technical writing, twenty-four programs that prepare students for careers as technical writers and editors indicated that their technical writing faculty enjoy about the same teaching loads, salaries, and chances for promotion and tenure as do equally qualified and experienced teachers of literature at their schools. The programs also indicated that they have a growing number of openings on their faculties for teachers of technical writing. Finally, the programs ranked and rated seventeen qualifications that might be offered by applicants for those positions; the most significant conclusion drawn from the rankings and ratings is that the programs look more favorably upon experience - both in teaching and in working as a technical writer or editor - than they do upon formal study of technical writing or the teaching of it.""The authors determined how Caribbean immigrants position themselves and make sense of their workplace communication through their storytelling. Using the constant comparative technique, they analyzed interviews with 25 Caribbean immigrants and found two discursive positionings: (a) within their cultural-moral narratives of the American Dream and (b) in stories that reproduce and resist specific intercultural workplace communication. Personal sensemaking stories broke down the monolithic cultural and moral narratives of the American Dream to display participants' perceptions about, communicative strategies for, and discursive self-positioning for handling their unique workplace experiences. They made sense of their experiences through invocation of difference discourses-race, class, gender, and immigrant status-and actively sought ways of asserting their agency materially and discursively. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Proponents of computerized text-analysis (CTA) systems like Bell Laboratories' Writer's Workbench contend that the computer's analysis of a text's surface features can help students become better writers and editors. Several colleges and universities have already integrated the new technology into their writing programs, and others will consider doing so in the future. Teachers of technical writing, however, ought to investigate carefully the capabilities and limitations of CTA before applying it to the technical writing classroom. Not even the most sophisticated of today's computers can detect the basic grammar and punctuation errors that bedevil student writers. Moreover, the computer's evaluation of a text's readability and style is untrustworthy and lacks a sound theoretical and pedagogical foundation; indeed, the machine's quantitative-based analysis of writing style might do some students more harm than good. Finally, there is no empirical evidence that CTA helps students become better writers."An effective pedagogy narrows or closes the gap between what is taught in pre- professional communications programs and what is expected on the job. Case studies are often an important element in such pedagogy. But an analysis of cases recently published in Business Communication Quarterly and a survey of 25 employees who consider writing important to successful performance at work show that we may be giving our students instruction they will rarely use. The BCQ cases typically require students to respond to exceptional rhetorical situations when in reality the rhetorical situations writers usually face require more mundane and standardized types of discourse."Case problems based upon believable circumstances can improve instruction in technical writing in college courses and industrial seminars. Such case problems give students and trainees realistic tasks, carry them through the various stages of writing a report, and reflect the systems approach to technical writing. This article explains the usefulness of case problems, suggests ways and criteria for their preparation, and offers a brief example of a case problem.""Case studies are evocative narrative descriptions of a specific, real-world activity, event, or problem. Case-based learning is well established in professional education (e.g., law, business, medicine) and rapidly expanding in many other disciplines. We use cases as an instructional resource in our own teaching of usability engineering. In this paper, we analyze the proposition that cases can be a minimalist-information design technique - that is, as a design technique that (1) orients information to facilitate user action, (2) anchors information in activity, (3) prevents, mitigates, and leverages error, and (4) develops user autonomy. We discuss the next steps in a research program on case-based learning and speculate on other applications of cases as minimalist information design. © 2006 IEEE."The authors present a typical online information system and discuss the problems inherent in its use. The problems are addressed by a revised system which provides easier access to the database for both novice and experienced users. The system is illustrated by a scenario of a typical interaction with the revised system."This paper describes a five-year research project aimed at developing a corpus-based language support tool able to respond to the English writing needs of Japanese software engineers who do not speak English natively. Our research was based on recent developments in corpus and text linguistics. Since foreign readers often complain that English text produced by Japanese authors is difficult to understand because it is poorly organized and incoherent, we focused on the possibility of designing a writing tool that would provide discourse-level as well as sentence-level assistance. We collected a total of 539 sample English abstracts from four well-known technical journals and tagged them with linguistic and rhetorical information. Using this tagged corpus, an initial prototype was developed on a Unix-based workstation and a second one on the web. The web-based prototype was then evaluated in terms of its usability by engineers in Ricoh's Software Research and Development Group. They evaluated the final product positively. However, they expressed uncertainty about its ability to address their weaknesses in using transition words effectively as cohesive devices. In spite of unexpected difficulties, product improvement continues.""This tutorial is an outgrowth of a classroom-based simulation project and should act as a general outline for using simulations in English for Science and Technology classrooms. The simulation was created based on an actual court case involving two software companies; however, the case was altered significantly to meet the needs of the students. Twenty-six Japanese students studying computer science at a university in northern Japan participated in the simulation. In phase one of the simulation, teams of students were required to make difficult decisions about the case in their role as company engineers. They subsequently wrote of their positions in teams. In phase two of the simulation, each student was required to preside over the related court case, judge between the two companies, and render a fair verdict in writing. The students' writing exhibited an understanding of the complexity of problems and sound reasoning for addressing such problems; therefore, the simulation-based curriculum was deemed highly successful. Furthermore, students remained engaged throughout the simulation, in part because they could see its long-term value.""Between 1884 and 1926, such publishers of technological information as Henley Publishing, Audel Publishing, John Wiley, Van Nostrand, McGraw-Hill, and Practical Publications put out dozens and dozens of technical catechisms on a wide variety of technical subjects. Then, around 1926, these publishers ceased releasing texts called catechisms. What made the genre so popular? Did it disappear? The answers to these questions provide a case study of genre adaptation, genre change, and genre persistence within technical communication. © 2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""I explore the role of categories as rhetorical barriers in organizations responding to crisis (Veil, 2011). I analyze some problematic categories of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the categories impact on the organizations response to Hurricane Katrina. My analysis shows that unintended and perverse consequences (Giddens, 1984, 1987) reversed the power of a key legitimated category (Orlikowski, 1995; Giddens, 1984) and exposed a set of reified categories (Giddens, 1984). © 2015 © 2015 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Rhetorical categories can and should be developed by scholars of professional writing to identify how values held within professions constrain the ways discourse is interpreted in organizational settings. Empirical research (conducted by the author and others), discourse theory, and pedagogical practice in professional writing strongly suggest that at least three categories of professional writing exist: engineering, administrative, and technical/professional writing. The author demonstrates this claim and distinguishes the characteristics of these three categories. Engineering writing is shown to respond to professional values of scientific objectivity and professional judgment as well as to corporate interests. Administrative writing reflects the locus of decision-making authority and promotes institutional identity. Technical/professional writing aims to accommodate audience needs through complying with professional readability standards. Future research should focus on defining the characteristics of these varieties more precisely. Articulated definitions of these three varieties of professional writing can help scholars and practitioners better understand how discourse is framed and interpreted in organizational settings. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

These genres, which are exemplified by speeches given at events such as industry conferences or company ceremonies, are unlike other business speech genres in that they pursue two main communication ends at once. They take on an assignment set by the speaking occasion while simultaneously pursuing the speaker's commercial objective. CEO speakers construct the hybrid speeches of these two genres by drawing on and modifying single-purpose speech types regularly used today both in business and in other sectors. Recognizing the dual communication purpose of hybrid speeches is critical for understanding their unusual structures and for developing appropriate standards to evaluate them. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""Unlike undergraduate students in an introductory business- or technical-writing course, graduate students in an advanced professional-writing course seldom need to be motivated to study language, style, and genres. After describing the students in her advanced course, the author outlines the assignments for her course, then focuses on one assignment that some students consider irrelevant. Rather than trying to justify the value of the assignment herself, the author posits a rhetorical case that requires students to justify the assignment themselves. Although the rhetorical case focuses on the book-review assignment, the case can be adapted to any assignment that encounters student resistance. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Then each passage was tested for its readability when subjects were administered a cloze procedure and a recall exercise for each paragraph. The results show that violations of the given-new contract make technical paragraphs more difficult to read; that changing repeated words to pronouns makes passages more difficult to follow; that using synonyms (instead of repetitions) makes prose harder to read; and that deleting a topic sentence may impede a reader's comprehension.""In my technical writing class, I examine two “meanings” from the Challenger disaster to illustrate the social contingency of meaning even in science and technology. These instances are the “anomalous” charring of the O-rings and the reconceptualized assumption of flightworthiness the night before the launch. The social contingency of these meanings shows that the “object” of technical communication is not the material object as a pre-existent isolate but in its social interpretation, significance, and meaning. Ultimately, technical communication is about people communicating about and to the interests of other people. © 1992, (publisher).

Students at a South Texas university work to establish communication with clients in a city-county health department to create effective documents and disseminate family health legislation. To prepare students for interactions in multicultural settings, the teacher provides an instructional framework that highlights the concepts and values of intercultural communication and the principles for effective problem-solving. Students engaged in the Baby Moses (el niño Moisés) project encounter misunderstandings, rhetorical challenges within the process of document creation, and cultural tensions that thwart their goal to disseminate information to the community. Students and the teacher learn that the classroom, like the city-county health department, is a fertile site for cultural disequilibrium, tensions, and potential cultural awareness. To insure a viable Technical and Professional Writing Program in a culturally diverse university and surrounding community, the teacher identifies opportunities that help students develop and enhance their identities as culturally-sensitive communicators and effective problem solvers. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The article presents a speech by Paula J.

But a case history demonstrates that challenges confront the developer of research-based guidelines for website design. First, few studies of people using the Web have yet been conducted. Second, when the process of guideline development is not systematic and designed to control bias and subjectivity, the resulting guidelines can be compromised. This paper describes the issues and problems one guideline developer encountered and suggests a guideline development process that might resolve them.""This paper reports on a 10-year case study at a Chinese university of a faculty team's attempt to develop and disseminate a project-based computer-assisted language learning (CALL) program for professional communication. The discussion focuses on three main challenges (professional/academic values, pedagogical philosophy, and institutional culture) to expand a project-based CALL program at this university. Based on the findings, this paper discusses how the implementation of project-based CALL for professional communication needs to be founded upon a good understanding of China's sociocultural contexts and how it might be tailored in order to be more responsive to the local university context. This paper concludes by suggesting a path that practitioners might take in light of these circumstances and challenges. © 2011 IEEE.""Business communication and technical writing students face a new workplace challenge: responding to problems that reflect a multicultural dimension and involve business-people whose perspectives, values, and traditions are not Western. Case studies are a good teaching strategy to introduce multicultural issues in business communication. Case studies involve students in group settings and demand both problem-solving and human-relations skills. Adding discussion questions to case-study problems prompts student responses, and assigning a follow-up progress report or memorandum ties the case-study reviews to course goals.

The number of journals in the basic sciences, the medical sciences, and technology-related industries continues to climb, worldwide, but the universal data-base on scientific periodicals remains fragmentary and needs completion. Primary-source scientific journals are relatively few in number, in most languages, and current economic considerations suggest that this number will not rise significantly. Journals of popularization, on the other hand, continue to grow in number and variety. Current specialization in primary- and secondary-source journals may gradually give way to consolidation of journals now serving highly focused, comparatively small audiences.""How have Dutch instructive texts changed in the course of the last century? This question is the topic of a research project presented in this article. First, we give some insight into the kind of documents we have collected in our corpus. The oldest instructive texts date from the beginning of the nineteenth century. But for most technical devices, the tradition of adding an instructive text starts about 1925. After that we present a few results of the investigations: the disappearance of persuasive passages and of realistic representations of human beings. Finally, we give a more detailed sketch of the development of the algorithmic style.""Instead of employing most communications professionals mainly as technical writers and editors, one should be encouraging them to apply their expertise in a much broader capacity. Rather than simply guide, advise and write for a handful of engineers or scientists, they should offer solid, practical training in communications and report writing to as many technical professionals as they can reach.""Although teachers of technical writing have long considered themselves as the vanguard, they too have shown considerable resistance to change, despite recent theoretical advances in composition theory. This author proposes that the technical writing community review its traditional views and attitudes toward the teaching of writing to incorporate insight derived from cross-disciplinary research. More specifically, the author proposes 1) Technical writing is both referential and persuasive; 2) Technical writing is a mean between scientific writing and advertising; 3) Most of what the current textbooks talk about is editing - dealing with the surface structure of the writing; little attention is paid to learning technology as one writes - dealing with the deep structure of writing as a way of discovering new insight.""This case study of a faculty strike examines the crisis response strategies of a university and its faculty union and the changing uses of technology to communicate to key stakeholders. An analysis of the types of crisis response strategies reveals that both the university and the faculty union used defensive and ingratiation strategies to build their cases and protect their reputations. The university also used denial to argue that the strike was not disrupting operations. The university and the union both relied on e-mails, Web sites, and press releases to update their constituencies. The difference was that for the union in particular, technology both expanded the options for sending information and accelerated the flow of information when conditions changed. The case study illustrates that technology has diminished an organization's control of crisis communication by opening numerous communication channels for others to use to explain their positions and build support. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Previous researchers have given conflicting views as to what makes a ""good"" research article (RA) title. In this paper, characteristic features of research article titles, including length, punctuation usage, word frequency, and preposition usage are investigated using a corpus of 600 research articles from the six journals of the IEEE Computer Society. Results show, while some of the intuitive observations made in the literature about title writing are accurate for computer science journals, other observations have ignored the effects of discipline and field variation. Subsequently, these observations are either unjustified or misleading.""This study was an attempt to determine characteristic oral and written business communication problems of selected managerial trainees in the Memphis-Shelby County, Tennessee area and to determine whether the problems defined by these trainees were those recognized by the secretary and immediate supervisor of the trainee.

To illustrate this point, the author exemplifies the semiotic approaches by scholars in technical communication and elaborates Morris's model through analyzing visual and verbal elements of technical communication brochures from semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic levels. The discussion of semiotic approach reinforced by various examples illustrates that the semiotic model can be a tangible theoretical and practical tool to help students and practitioners study and analyze the use of visual and verbal elements in technical communication.""Popular management theories are a prominent fixture of the contemporary American business landscape. Past research regarding these theories has focused on what drives interest in a particular theory. This reader-based study departs from this tradition and focuses instead on how managers report they prefer to read the books used to promote popular management theories. Through a semiotic analysis of data gathered from surveys administered to and interviews conducted with 22 managers, this study identifies the main features and charts the organizing principles of the rules that guide managerial reading preferences, identifies influences shaping these rules, and points out how enactment of these rules influences the acquisition of knowledge about popular management theories. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Chaucer’s A Treatise on the Astrolabe—despite its medieval roots—still serves as a model for how modern technical writers can judiciously incorporate into their writing such central rhetorical components as coherent organization, appropriate content, accurate and precise descriptions, personable tone, effective metadiscourse, and varied sentence structure and length. This article explores how Chaucer’s merging of his logico-rational self (as exhibited in the work’s deliberate organization and thorough content) with his humanistic self (as shown in his simple style and personable tone) is an effective technique for humanizing and strengthening a technical document. By following the lessons learned from Treatise, modern technical writers can minimize the semantic and psychological noise of a document, while maximizing the accurate and comfortable transmission of its content. © 1993 IEEE""North American technical communicators visiting China discovered a field at its earliest stages.

Presenting these differences in light of the historical, economic, and education influences that have shaped both countries’ need for technical communication, we compare a variety of documents to demonstrate the differences based on cultural influences.""In a country like Singapore, which is rated high in power distance and low in indi vidualism (using Hofstede's dimensions of national cultures), interviews for entry- level positions in multinational corporations (MNCs) may reveal subtle clashes in culture. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed transcripts of job interviews involving nine English-speaking applicants from Chinese backgrounds and two experienced interviewers from Anglo-American MNCs in Singapore. Our assumption was that a person's cultural background and upbringing influence his or her perform ance at job interviews. The findings reveal that Chinese applicants tend to defer to the interviewer (i.e. superior) and focus on the group or family, besides being averse to self-assertion. Hence, applicants from a Chinese background may be dis advantaged when being interviewed for jobs with MNCs which are heavily influ enced by Anglo-American culture. © 2000, Sage Publications.

The use of the system for chit-chat, synchronous conferences, and electronic journals is described. The majority of the users, spread over all the UK, logged first into the informal areas of communication, but their frequency of access to the system varied considerably. One result of computer conferencing was that four people who had not previously met had regular online conferences to discuss a particular area of work, which was subsequently published as a scientific paper. Because the computer used was also in full use as a university service, some initial trials were made to establish its usefulness an an aid for learning. The author concludes with a discussion on facilitating computer conferencing communication.""Research indicates that “rule-based” writing and writing pedagogy may be inadequate and irrelevant for management practice. As an alternative, this article introduces the notion of “choice-based” writing, an approach which examines the range of writing op tions available in any given managerial context. Two questions are addressed: (1) What is choice-based writing? and (2) What is choice-based writing instruction? Dis cussion of the second question centers on a particular writing choice of a select group of managers in a specific communication context — namely, field managers' use of nar rative for Dealer Contact Reports.

They typically limit themselves to a small repertoire of graph types and select from it on the basis of habit, if not sheer ease of production. Similarly, the many books on graphing devote much attention to graphical integrity and readability, but little or none to graph selection. We developed a methodology to help engineers, scientists, and managers choose the ""right graph"" on the basis of three criteria: the structure of the data set in terms of number and type of variables, the intended use of the graph, and the research question or intended message. The first and third criteria allow one to construct an effective two-entry selection table.""In a series of books published between 1964 and 1987 (C. Alexander, 1964; 1987; C. Alexander et al., 1975; 1977), Christopher Alexander, an urban planner and architect, has inspired object oriented programmers with his idea of a pattern language, which originally catalogued solutions to common problems faced by any community or individual creating livable structures such as a town or a house. His approach might also help technical communicators polish and perfect our own standard rhetorical structures (such as the procedure, user guide, or reference), viewed as common ways of answering frequent, if virtual questions from our users. Alexander's way of describing age-old patterns such as neighbourhoods, streets, paths, and homes may give us a model for creating our own set of patternsin technical communication, whether or not we adopt some of the eager elaborations offered by folks in the object oriented design world.""The case of Lucille Pieti, a technical writer at Chrysler, serves as a discipline-specific illustration of some of Rossiter's (1995) generalizations about women scientists and engineers after World War II.

Her case is unusual, however, because she became a national celebrity. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""This study examines the controversy over alleged cannibalism in the prehistoric American Southwest as it played out in scholarly journals. It also examines the lessons those controversies provide technical communication. Data painstakingly collected from human remains at ancestral Pueblo sites have been interpreted as representing cannibalism and, alternatively, as indicating witchcraft, mutilation of the dead, and warfare. Three focal points of this study are the circular process of developing criteria for analysis in archaeology, the role of analogy in building hypotheses, and the role of gestalt in interpretation of the findings. This study also looks at the ways narratives contribute to knowledge building. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The bibliographic references and citations which exist among documents in a given document collection can be used to study the history and scope of particular subject areas and to assess the importance of individual authors, documents, and journals. A clustering study of computer science literature is described, using bibliographic citations as a clustering criterion, and conclusions are drawn regarding the scope of computer science and the characteristics of individual documents in the area. In particular, the clustering characteristics lead to a distinction between core and fringe areas in the field and to the identification of particularly influential articles.""This article develops a multimodal model for how claims and evidence work across linguistic, numeric, and visual modes in the professional writing of environmental scientists. I coded and analyzed two reports (Bacey & Barry, 2008; Levine et al., 2005) written by research scientists working for California's Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) by applying concepts from studies of argument, genre, and visual representations in science. The claim-evidence patterns show initial and summative claims as well as warrants being presented in linguistic forms; however, supporting evidence (i.e., data and backing) is found in numeric, visual, and linguistic forms. These findings highlight the need to extend Toulmin's understanding of claim-evidence relationships into a more robust multimodal model. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.""In technical marketing to the government, the purpose for writing clarification questions is to improve the firm's chances of preparing a winning proposal. Written clarification questions are a valuable means of obtaining information from the potential customer once the RFP has been released. Well-worded clarification questions can also persuade the government to accept one approach and to suspect competitors' approaches. Since the government releases all written clarification questions and answers, they provide valuable competitive information to all bidders. Thus, clarification questions must simultaneously present a position to the government, and conceal it from competitors. © 1988 IEEE""Technical communicators have an opportunity, according to the author, to participate in the national campaign to clarify Federal regulations.

Building a connection to the real world has real challenges, however, for both instructors and students. How can we better prepare students for their future careers in our technical communication courses? Situating the case: This paper draws on three areas in the literature to situate the Arisoph case study: First, we discuss the work that has been done with client-based projects and the problems and challenges researchers have found with incorporating these projects into the classroom. Second, we discuss a newer model of workplace simulations, particularly focusing on the work done by Fisher and Russell. Third, we discuss the psychological theories of attribution and reattribution, which provided a foundation for our development of the Arisoph case study. How this case was studied: This paper describes the development of the Arisoph case study, an online client-based simulation course designed for engineering students to learn and practice technical communication. Course development and collection of instructor and student responses took place from 2010 to 2014. About the case: This paper details the development and implementation of the Arisoph case study, which brought the workplace realities of a variety of engineering professions into a classroom filled with engineering majors. The Arisoph simulation was designed to manage student attribution and reattribution, particularly to help engineering students connect the principles and skills learned in technical communication courses with their future careers. The Arisoph case study is a full-semester simulation, where students apply for work in a fictional company and fulfill different roles on professional teams. Each assignment during the semester is situated in the context of the simulation. The major projects for the simulation, however, come from a real client in the engineering field. This unique combination of simulation and client-based projects provides students with greater opportunities for successful reattribution. Conclusions: Initial student reactions to the course show an increased understanding of workplace communication and a greater motivation to produce the best possible product for the client. We hope that long-term studies will show significant carryover of those attitudes into students' careers. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article describes an audience analysis exercise that offers a striking series of examples of how one business communication textbook has been adapted over the years by its authors to accommodate these authors’ changing perceptions of their audience. The exercise also attempts to make students aware of their own involvement in various discourse communities by means of a letter-writing activity and subsequent classroom discussion. Additionally, this article argues for the need to help students become aware of how the values and presuppositions of discourse communities affect communications within those communities. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Such models, which focus on both ""what"" and ""when/where,"" need to be more expressive than conventional conceptual models (e.g., the ER model), which primarily focus on ""what"" is important for a given application. In this study, we view conceptual schema comprehension of geospatio-temporal data semantics in terms of matching the external problem representation (that is, the conceptual schema) to the problem-solving task (that is, syntactic and semantic comprehension tasks), an argument based on the theory of cognitive fit. Our theory suggests that an external problem representation that matches the problem solver's internal task representation will enhance performance, for example, in comprehending such schemas. To assess performance on geospatio-temporal schema comprehension tasks, we conducted a laboratory experiment using two semantically identical conceptual schemas, one of which mapped closely to the internal task representation while the other did not. As expected, we found that the geospatio-temporal conceptual schema that corresponded to the internal representation of the task enhanced the accuracy of schema comprehension; comprehension time was equivalent for both. Cognitive fit between the internal representation of the task and conceptual schemas with geospatio-temporal annotations was, therefore, manifested in accuracy of schema comprehension and not in time for problem solution. Our findings suggest that the annotated schemas facilitate understanding of data semantics represented on the schema. © 2006 IEEE.""In this paper, we first develop a framework of user-database interaction. Based on this framework, we then provide a discussion on how notable human factors influence various dimensions of user-database interaction. Following that, we propose using cognitive mapping techniques to overcome some cognitive and behavioral biases during user-database interaction. Three popular cognitive mapping techniques-causal mapping, semantic mapping, and concept mapping-are introduced as techniques to elicit an individual's belief systems regarding a problem domain. Through an example database application, we demonstrate how to use these cognitive mapping techniques to improve user-database interaction. Finally, we discuss the implications of this research for technical communicators during user-database interaction analysis and design. © 2006 IEEE.""Measuring culture is a central issue in international management research and has been traditionally accomplished using indices of cultural values. Although a number of researchers have attempted to identify measures to account for the core elements of culture, there is no consensus on those measures. This article uses an alternative method-discourse analysis-to observe what actually occurs in terms of communication practices in intercultural decision-making meetings, specifically those involving U.S.-born native English speakers and participants from East Asian countries. Previous discourse studies in this area suggest that differences in communication practices may be attributed to power differentials or language competence. Our findings suggest that the conversation style differences we observed might be attributed to intergroup identity issues instead. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""A brief overview of methods relating language education to psychological theories and models is provided. Strengths and weaknesses of behaviorist and mentalist approaches are surveyed, followed by an outline of a recently developing cognitive-process approach. The approach is then illustrated with an individual case study from the University of Florida writing program, with special consideration of the concerns of technical writing on the topic of automobile repair instructions. It is argued that specific tendencies carry over from speech habits that are partly supportive and partly contrary to success in learning the skills of technical writing. Consequently, appropriate training should be able to alleviate the contrary tendencies, provided we take into account the operations of writing.""In our case study, we examined the instant messaging (IM) workplace discourse of a pair of expert IM users. We found that the participants maintained discourse cohesion and thus coherence via short, rapidly sent transmissions that created uninterrupted transmission sequences. Such uninterrupted transmission sequences allowed each participant to maintain the floor. Also, the participants used topicalizations and performative verbs to maintain coherence. We also found that the participants' use of short transmissions may have ambiguated their enactment of their institutional roles and the rights afforded to them by those roles.""The fact that some ideas seem to be inexpressible directly in language and that the induction-hypothesis sequence in scientific thinking does not completely account for new ideas may be due to the peculiar abilities of the right and left hemispheres of the brain. Study of the mind and philosophers of perception suggest that perception and imagination or fact and intuition are combined in language, which then takes on new meaning through ″coherent deformation″ and leads to new thinking. This new thinking then can best be replicated in the reader through nondirect means such as metaphors and visual materials.""The early stages of the cold fusion controversy are reviewed. It is shown how ideas in the sociology of scientific knowledge such as “symmetry, ” “interpretative flexibility, ” and “experimenter's regress” are applicable to the controversy. It is argued that there is nothing exceptional about the dynamics of the debate, apart from the media attention. In cold fusion we see scientific controversy as normal. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Yet, knowledge of the rhetorical processes and social dimensions characterizing this type of collaboration remains scant and inadequate. This essay takes the stance that if rhetoricians hope to make significant strides forward in understanding writing that takes place both within and external to a single workplace culture, they will need to develop a much more expansive, complex, and sophisticated vision of collaboration across multiple organizational cultures. It suggests how, to accomplish this goal, rhetoricians might build on the strengths and overcome the limitations of past scholarship in organizational and related studies and in rhetoric, and it introduces new directions these scholars might take and new questions they might explore in future investigations in this area of inquiry. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study analyzes these collaborations, inquiring into the ways in which writers' and designers' processes of collaboration directly affect the form and substance of a finished manual. We argue that when these developers have dialogue, draft iteratively, and jointly make decisions, they produce manuals that could not possibly be developed through linear, assembly-line collaborative processes. We characterize three possible models of collaboration—assembly line (linear drafting), swap meet (iterative drafting and joint problem solving), and symphony (codevelopment in every aspect)—and use as a case study our own collaboration in developing a manual, detailing the concerns that writers and designers bring to a manual project. Analyzing our collaboration as an example of a swap-meet model, we examine four design problems that we faced and explain the ways in which our collaborative processes uniquely shaped our solutions to these problems. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

I considered the frequency, types of research, and themes in the 55-article collection. My analysis reveals differences in the authors' discussions of collaboration depending on whether the collaboration occurred in the classroom or the workplace. I also found that most of the 55 articles were more concerned with collaborative practice than with theoretical discussions of collaboration. Suggestions for future research include investigating how experienced workplace collaborators and experienced teachers of collaborative skills in technical communication courses solve the nonroutine problems that occur when practice becomes difficult. From these investigations, researchers might determine what constitutes expertise in collaboration.""Although collaboration in technical communication is not a recent phenomenon, the attention it is receiving is new. This recent attention has generated an increasing number of well-designed and provocative studies that are concerned with collaboration in technical communication contexts as well as with the processes of collaboratively conceptualizing, creating, and producing technical texts. Much of this research, which is forcing a reexamination of theories that affect the pedagogy and practice of collaboration, draws on abroad interdisciplinary foundation and utilizes an array of multi-methodological approaches, both quantitative and qualitative. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Students from the University of Western Sydney and the University of Minnesota worked in pairs to respond to four decision-making scenarios over a 4-week period. Using e-mail, students came to a decision more quickly than with the use of IRC, and when IRC was slow, students reverted to a series of rapid-fire e-mail messages to facilitate their work. Students appreciated the cross-cultural experience; however, they struggled to create a shared communicative context via the Internet.""The essay begins with an intellectual framework for describing a visual-verbal interface.

Constructing effective evaluation tools can be a daunting task. As shown by a review of literature, best practices include (1) building a foundation in the classroom that supports collaborative evaluation, (2) creating effective evaluation tools by articulating specific criteria and ensuring honest student participation (3) implementing formative feedback during the col laborative experience, (4) formulating summative feedback at the conclusion of the experience, and (5) assessing the collaborative evaluation process. © 2002, Sage Publications.

In this exploratory study, I ask if students in a business and professional writing course can transform knowledge when cued to do so in an invention activity—collaborative planning sessions—but are given no other instructional help. Further, I ask what kinds of instructional scaffolding students provide for each other in their planning sessions. Collaborative planning sessions for two pairs of students on three different business writing assignments were recorded and transcribed. Detailed descriptive analyses of these transcripts suggest that the students transformed knowledge when they faced rhetorically complex tasks, when the writer showed commitment to the topic, when they engaged in extended discussion, and when they focused on rhetorical issues. Further, the students provided each other with both relatively simple instructional scaffolds (active listening, identification of simple problems, and providing opportunities for extended elaboration) and more sophisticated, situation-specific prompts to transform knowledge (posing specific questions based on explicit rhetorical concerns and challenging each other to completely reconsider how they were approaching a writing task). Implications for pedagogy and research are briefly considered. © 1994, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.""More and more, technical experts are teaming up to produce technical documents. Dividing the workload horizontally, with each team member handling a separate chapter or section, doesn't work very well. Stratifying the project vertically, with a project team leader, a data gatherer, a writer, an editor, and a graphics person, is a more efficient and more effective method of collaborative writing. The process is quicker and the product is better because team members get to do what they are best at. © 1989 IEEE""Hypertext systems are emerging as powerful tools for supporting collaborative writing activities.

This article is based on a five-year ethnographic study that describes and analyzes a three-month group writing process that created a computer service-level agreement, involving a 20-person cross-functional core more than 100 other collaborators at a major corporation. The article discusses ""collective form"" in two senses: First, a document's evolving form or superstructure produced a collective schema that allowed the group through a process of equilibration (Piaget, 1981) to adapt outsider boilerplate into a more situated general model and then into a situated document. Second, architectural forms motivated and molded group activity in several ways. To combat group apathy, the leaders appropriated an in-demand meeting room for the project, positioning the project as high-status in the center of the workflow. Group leaders prominently displayed a task completion check-off chart that, in a downsizing environment, helped both to coordinate group activity and to encourage completion. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""The advantages of a college instructor as a writing consultant include thorough preparation, teaching skills, and easy availability.

The author argues that color is a distraction only when these processes and the documents upon which they operate are construed very narrowly. The article synthesizes many of the issues raised in the prior articles by Brockman, Horton, and Trummel. © 1991 IEEE""In today's increasingly technological world, the first impression of an orgnization is often based on a user's judgment of the corporate Web site's trustworthiness. This study investigates whether color as a Web site element can serve as a trustworthiness cue. In addition, the context of these Web sites was taken into account as research indicates that emotions associated with colors might differ between contexts. Method: An experimental study was conducted in which first impressions of trustworthiness of Web sites were measured in relation with the chosen color scheme. More than 200 participants evaluated eight finance, eight legal, and eight medical Web sites on perceived trustworthiness. Each respondent was presented with an identical Web site that only differed on the used color scheme. Four different color schemes (red, blue, green, and black) were put to the test. Result: The findings indicate that when the same Web site is presented using different color schemes, the Web sites are considered to have different levels of trustworthiness. Color has a statistically significant but limited effect, compared with all other reasons people can have to trust a Web site. Overall, the blue color scheme was perceived as most trustworthy and black as least trustworthy. The effect of the context is statistically significant, but very small. Conclusion: The color-trustworthiness relationship has never been demonstrated in the context of Web sites. This study supports the common sense idea with scientific evidence by showing that color matters in a user's judgment of a Web site's trustworthiness. Web site designers can increase the trustworthiness of a Web site by using an appropriate color scheme.""Asserts that color must be used to make information clear, lucid, powerful--faster; its logical application must be controlled by the editor Provides a comprehensive checklist to help editors use color effectively"Discusses color properties and color systems  Re-examines and supports Jan V.

However, there is still debate about the validity of the method, partly focusing on the usefulness and exhaustiveness of participants' verbalizations. The rise of eye-tracking technology sheds new light on this discussion, as participants' working processes can now be observed in more detail. Research questions: (1) What kinds of verbalizations do participants produce, and how do they relate to the information that can be directly observed using eye tracking? (2) What do eye movements reveal about cognitive processes at times when participants stop verbalizing? Literature review: Our study replicates an earlier study by Cooke (2010), who used a combination of CTA protocols and eye tracking in a small sample with experienced and highly educated participants to investigate the validity of CTA. Cooke's results suggest that the additional value of participants' verbalizations is limited: at least 77% of the verbalizations referred to things that could be easily observed with eye tracking. Methodology: We conducted a study in which 60 participants with different characteristics performed tasks on informational websites. During their task performance, they verbalized their thoughts, and simultaneously their eye movements were measured. The resulting think-aloud protocols were divided in verbalization units, which were coded into content types. Silences were registered, and eye movements during these silences were analyzed. Results and discussion: We found a different distribution of verbalization types than Cooke (2010) reported, with far more verbalizations where participants formulated doubts, judgments on the website, or expressions of frustration. In our study, verbalizations provided a substantial contribution in addition to the directly observable user problems. We measured a rather high percentage of silences (27%), during which participants most often were scanning pages for information. During these silences, interesting observations could be made about users' processes and obstacles on the website. The implication of our study is that we now have a better understanding of the types of verbalizations that a CTA evaluation might generate. Further, we know that relevant usability observations can be made during silences. A limitation is that we do not know yet the influence of specific characteristics of the evaluation setting on the types of verbalizations and silences. Future research should focus on the influence of evaluation settings on the outcomes of an evaluation, in particular, the influence of characteristics of the participants who are involved in the study. © 2012 IEEE.""The author suggests that answers to some of the more difficult questions in the readability-formula debate may be found in Walker Gibson's book, Tough, Sweet, and Stuffy. Gibson, in his analysis of style, develops a set of quantifiable characteristics of language that will produce tough talkers, sweet talkers, and stuffy talkers. In specifically analyzing these three familiar American voices, he is able to combine two necessary attributes of readability for technical communicators: a set of specific rules and a rationale for applying them, providing another slant on the readability issue.""Optical-fiber transmission lines appear attractive for a variety of communication applications in which twisted copper pairs and coaxial cables are now used.

This paper summarizes the current state of research on optical fibers, fiberguide cables, and splicing techniques, reviews the state of the art of fiber-compatible sources and detectors, and discusses various systems considerations, experiments, and applications.""“Commentary That Works for the Learning Business Writer” applies findings of recent composition research concerning instructor response to student writing to the specific context of learning business and professional communicators. It points out the errors and counterproductice outcomes of ineffective instructor/supervisor response, suggests functional alternatives, and illustrates by means of a novice writer's order/inquiry letter how those alternatives may result in an improved written product. Those alternatives involve feedback which includes the following basic elements: (1)commentary whose primary purpose is facilitative rather than evaluative; (2) the opportunity for multiple drafting, at least for beginning writers, of almost every writing project, (3) text-specific diagnostic advice which does not short-circuit the problem-solving process by offering deadening generalizations or substituting an “expert solution” for the novice's opportunity to learn, and (4) careful emphasis upon the differing priorities of revision and editing. © 1985, Sage Publications.

The authors analyze how corporate environmental reports are constructed at macro and micro discursive levels to promote a socially responsible image to in-group (e.g., employees and stockholders) and out-group (e.g., consumers) members. The results of the analysis show how these reports use ideological persuasion to influence or change audience members' opinions about corporate environmental sustainability. © The Author(s) 2012.""Educating undergraduate business students in the 21st century requires more than addressing the quantitative side of business; rather, it calls for including the more qualitative ""soft skills,"" such as speaking and writing.

The sender's credibility and background relative to the message can affect the receiver. Differences between sender's and receiver's experiences and attitudes are also important in how a message is received. The words that comprise messages and the tones used to express them can vary the meaning and interpretation of messages. People differ in their susceptibility to persuasion. Emotion has an effect in persuasion but more important are the order of presentation and the believability and effectiveness of the sender. Those who know how to listen and pay attention not only stand out as beacons of courtesy but also have an advantage - by understanding what is expected of them - in preparing their messages for others.""Human and organizational factors are commonly identified as causes and contributors to failures and difficulties in implementing planned change.

PechaKucha is a PowerPoint presentation format consisting of 20 slides that are shown for 20 seconds each. This article argues that the PechaKucha presentation format can be aligned with Nonaka's SECI model (socialization, externalization, combination, internalization) to look at competences from a knowledge creation perspective. From a managerial perspective, the theoretical discussion in this article can be used in organizational settings to share knowledge through PechaKucha presentations between people with different backgrounds. On the other hand, from a research perspective, this article has at least two implications. First, by combining semiotics with knowledge management this article attempts to renew the call for a semiotic/linguistic perspective to knowledge management. Second, by combining visual communication with written and oral communication, the author calls for a more holistic approach to knowledge-related research in organizational settings. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The aim of this study is to identify and interpret the main emerging strategic approaches in communicating a corporate brand through social media (SM). A quantitative content analysis of the SM platforms of 60 major international corporate brands yielded data that were processed by hierarchical cluster analysis. The study identified four clusters, characterized by distinctive approaches in terms of interactivity and openness toward corporate brand building via SM. The findings highlighted that despite encouraging signs of effective use of SM for this purpose, the online corporate communication initiatives of more than a third of all companies are characterized as cautious. Corporate branding strategists are advised to adopt conversational forms of corporate communication, to expand the range of SM used and to involve a broad range of stakeholders in the dialogue. This study adds to the limited body of academic research into the use of SM as part of corporate communication and corporate brand-building strategy. © The Author(s) 2014.""This research examines credibility in the discourse offered on the corporate Web sites of 60 British, Danish, and Norwegian public relations (PR) agencies. This study's purpose was to see whether the North European PR industry moves in the direction of convergence or divergence in their corporate self-presentations. The authors have done this by unfolding the rhetoric and language of PR agencies Web sites. In this process, this study tried to determine whether the rhetorical strategies they use to achieve credibility show signs across the industry of becoming more focused on the responsibilities, enthusiasm, and caring nature of corporations and less directed at communicating expertise. Thus, the study expected to show whether PR agencies seek to build credibility by way of much the same rhetorical strategies and language, or whether they pursue different strategies in trying to build unique images. In analyzing the data, it is found that PR agencies across the three countries assign similar relative importance to expertise, trustworthiness, and empathy, and interestingly also that they strongly prioritize explaining their expertise at the expense of expressing their empathy for clients. To begin to understand this reluctance toward incorporating empathy in discourse, the authors investigate the linguistic representation of this one central dimension to explain its complexity and to point to the potential of an untapped resource for strategically managing self-presentation in business communication. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article analyzes the communication of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate image in the chemical industry through mission slogans. Morsing's (2006) CSR communication framework is adapted for a comparative analysis of the strategies behind mission slogans.

However, it is unknown whether the passion entrepreneurs personally feel or experience can be accurately assessed by investors during a venture pitch. Research questions: (1) To what extent does entrepreneurs' personal passion align with investors' perceived passion? (2) To what cues do investors attend when assessing entrepreneurs' passion? Literature review: Integrating theory and research in entrepreneurship communication and entrepreneurial passion within the context of venture pitching, we explain that during venture pitches, investors make judgments about entrepreneurs' passion that have consequences for their investment decisions. However, they can attend to only those cues that entrepreneurs outwardly display. As a result, they may not be assessing the passion entrepreneurs personally feel or experience. Methodology: We used a sequential explanatory mixed methods research design. For our data collection, we surveyed 40 student entrepreneurs, videorecorded their venture pitches, and facilitated focus groups with 16 investors who viewed the videos and ranked, rated, and discussed their perceptions of entrepreneurs' passion. We conducted statistical analyses to assess the extent to which entrepreneurs' personal passion and investors' perceived passion aligned. We then performed an inductive analysis of critical cases to identify specific cues that investors attributed to passion or lack thereof. Results and conclusions: We revealed a large misalignment between entrepreneurs' personal passion and investors' perceived passion. Our critical case analysis demonstrated that entrepreneurs' weak or strong presentation skills led investors either to underestimate or overestimate, respectively, perceptions of entrepreneurs' passion. We suggest that entrepreneurs should develop specific presentation skills and rhetorical strategies for displaying their passion; at the same time, investors should be wary of attending too closely to presentation skills when assessing passion. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This paper looks at the virtual organization in an electronic market environment and the different models of communication and management that may be required. The authors begin by providing some clear definitions of virtual cultures and different models of virtuality that can exist within the electronic market. Degrees of virtuality can be seriously constrained by the extent to which organizations have predefined communication linkages in the marketplace and the extent to which these can be substituted by virtual ones, but also by the intensity of virtual linkages which support the virtual model. Six virtual organizational models are proposed within a dynamic framework of change. In order to realize strategic advantage, virtual organizations must align their management models and communication processes with their virtual culture.""Communication scholars and teachers agree that the first step in joining a community is to learn the conventions of discourse of the target discipline. But argument in public policy arenas often involves multiple disciplines and must address ethical as well as technical issues. The authors term such discourse forums “non-congruent sites” and explore the problem of how to determine when the field-specific discourse conventions of specialists appropriately give way to ethical argument.

It reports in part a large research project investigating a gender and career program launched by the human resource department in a Danish, medium-sized bank chain (referred to as ""the Bank""). Using the Bank's main written recruitment genre (the bank manager job ad) as a case in point, and including the results of two semistructured focus group interviews, this study reveals interesting insights into organizational recruitment tactics and provides an argument for the need to explore the relationship between recruitment needs, textual choices, gender, and career advancement. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""The aim of this article is to study employees’ discursive construction of disparate survivor responses. The analysis reveals how employees position themselves simultaneously within different types of categories by use of discursive actions.

The study examines the problems of risk communication in a cross-cultural context at three levels: (a) the technical problems of representing safety information in an uncertain and hazardous environment, (b) the translation problem of multiple representations and cultural understandings in a cross-cultural environment, and (c) the rhetorical problem of defining a rational basis for argument about what constitutes safety in an economic and political context. This article expands upon previous notions of cross-cultural communication as the translation processes necessary to mediate cultural difference or translate from one culture to another. In examining risk communication within a larger global context, this article analyzes the problems writers face in applying generalized models of communication practice to solve technical problems in a culturally and politically complex global economy.""Committees within international standards organizations write standards. Prior to approval, these standards must pass through several reviews for technical accuracy and stylistic appropriateness. The style considerations are based on documents published by both the umbrella organization (International Organization for Standarization, or ISO) and the various committees and subcommittees within it. Because authors and editors who use these documents frequently do not have English as a first language, the documents must explain unambiguously just how committees should prepare their documents. This study looks at a sample of those instructional documents using Restricted and Elaborated Code and metadiscourse analysis to determine how easily users can read and understand the material. The findings suggest that the documents do not send a clear message to authors and editors and can be stylistically hard to understand. Consequently, the approved standards themselves are hard to read and interpret.""Research conducted at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations (UK) in the 1950s formed the foundation of what later came to be called the socio-technical system. This system views production systems as being comprised of both technological and social parts. Socio-technical systems theory became the foundation of self-directed work teams—a way of working also known as “autonomous,” “composite,” and “self-regulating.” Most literature on the subject suggests using a process approach to implementing any change to a self-regulating work style and phasing in the process over a period of from two to five years. However, this study will show how one factory prepared its workers for such a change in a much shorter period of time. © 1993 IEEE""This paper examines two components of the user-database interface: the data modeling constructs used to represent the database structure and the query language constructs used for data retrieval. From a theoretical perspective, if both the data modeling and query language support high-level abstractions (HLAs), such as generalization and composition, then the ""semantic distance"" between the user and the interface will be reduced. We used an in-depth verbal protocol study to explore how users were able to effectively complete two tasks: constructing a data model with HLAs and formulating queries against the data model. Results suggest that a successful strategy for modeling with HLAs involves the systematic transition between higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, there is some support for the idea that there is a ""productivity payoff"" to modeling with HLAs, because subsequent query can be simplified. © 2006 IEEE.""Risk communication has been explored in technical communication for over 15 years, but it has been largely confined to communicating the risk of industrial activity, medical risks, or environmental threats to the public. Using the framework previous risk communication has provided, this article applies those ideas to research science, specifically to stem cell research, where government opposition until recently has limited this research, preventing it from potentially providing organs for those who need a replacement or more effective treatments for other diseases such as diabetes or Parkinson's disease. Risk communication in the United States and Europe is contrasted to delineate the greater effort being made in Europe to construct stem cell research socially for the researcher and the public.""Accountants have devoted considerable resources to improving “numbers” in accounting reports.

Research questions: (1) Do people in a particular generational cohort behave according to the stereotypes assigned to their cohort? (2) Do people in a particular generation believe that the stereotypes assigned to their generation are accurate? Literature review: Current literature promulgates generational stereotypes and encourages managers to learn about the differences of each cohort so that they can tailor their communication to each cohort. Knowing the differences allegedly provides managers of technical communication teams or any team with more effective strategies to communicate with, motivate, and retain members of each cohort. Much of the literature examined was not based on rigorous research, and some that was rigorous and empirical claims there are more similarities than differences among the cohorts. Methodology: The findings from this study are based on answers to surveys from 107 participants and semistructured interviews with eight of those participants who were employees at a software company or were students or employees at a local university. The findings challenge the stereotypes found in the current literature, specifically concerning longevity in a job and workplace compliance. Conclusions, limitations, and future research: Managers need to learn more about individual employees rather than relying on stereotypes of generational cohorts when communicating with employees. Learning about individuals is simple and can foster more effective communication, which will enhance employees' job satisfaction and engagement, and ultimately employee retention. As the research reported in this study shows, these are crucial variables to consider about a person's tenure in a position and workplace compliance behavior but are not included by most when studying generational cohorts. Further research could help us learn how managers can best develop employees and recognize and reward employees' workplace achievements. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Faculty culture and communication networks are pivotal components of technology transfer on university campuses. Universities are focused upon diffusing technology to external clients and upon building structure and support systems to enhance technology transfer. However, engaging faculty members in technology transfer requires an internal diffusion of new ideas that are largely dependent upon faculty culture. New policies, structures, and support staff help to promote technology transfer ideologically, but are of little use if faculty researchers avoid involvement because of more intangible factors. The current study investigates this internal diffusion on one campus, using interviews with faculty members, administrators, technology transfer office personnel, licensees, and spin-off company administrators. Results show that faculty culture concerning technology transfer is dependent upon informal communication networks, principles of diffusion, history, and social interaction. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This conceptual article presents a critical review of gender-difference and gender-sameness theory and research. The focus is upon gender workplace communication, a topic often debated in the popular and organizational literature. A contextually-based integrated paradigm is proposed which represents a shift from a gender-difference foundation to a more integrated approach that includes the interaction of gender with Standpoint Theory, culture, organizational climate, and structure and task context. The network of shared meanings concept is introduced as having a major impact on gender communication orientation. Research using an example of communication to create a contextual meaning for social support is highlighted. Implications and conclusions for organizations, researchers, and educators are discussed. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""With the emergence of the computer, the role of the business communicator—traditionally an information specialist in research, writing, and teaching—is changing markedly.

Therefore, this study uses data about communication patterns and attitudes to index abstract, unobserved variables in a general model of behavior in organizations. Using communication data to index abstract variables enriches the interpretation of relationships between the communication indexes and other aspects of organization.""Systems theory views communication as a system binder, crucial for the survival and growth of organization.

Results indicated that various measures of communication apprehension, telephone apprehension, and writing apprehension, can account for a small, significant percentage of the variance in channel preferences. Results were interpreted as suggesting that personal fears (apprehensions) have the potential to reduce organizational efficiency and interfere with the achievement of personal goals. © 1984, Sage Publications.

It proposes these styles as cognitive variables that shape communication apprehension (CA). We report an empirical study of oral briefings by naval officers. Results show that CA was linked to two interpretive styles: it was positively linked to deficiency focusing (the tendency to focus on what is wrong, can go wrong, and is wrong with oneself) and negatively linked to envisioning success (the tendency to build mental images of succeeding). Results also show that CA diminished performance on the briefing, and that greater preparation was not an effective way of coping with apprehension. © 1994, Sage Publications.

This work has identified three dimensions of USER PARTICIPATION: responsibility, user-IS relationship, and hands-on activity. However, this three-dimensional view of user participation does not capture an important aspect of participation, communication between users and with various stakeholders. This paper replicates and extends past research by proposing the addition of a fourth dimension, COMMUNICATION ACTIVITY. Data collected from 324 users drawn from 162 IS development teams were used to replicate our three dimensions and to examine evidence for the construct validity of the new dimension. Consistent with expectations, strong evidence was found suggesting that communication activity needs to be considered a fourth dimension of user participation.""A field study of 110 owner / managers of independent restaurants was conducted to as sess the communication attributes of information sources used for operational decision making.

However, follow-up studies designed to chart the actual impact that an audit makes upon communication performance have not been reported. Rather, audits are typically presented as one-shot events, whose impact is not measured. It is as if the audit is an end in itself rather than part of a process of measurement and performance improvement. This paper is therefore timely because it employs a follow-up audit to track the effects of an initial audit upon a major health care organization. The findings do not support the view that the frequently expressed desire of staff for greater communication is a metamyth, and that an increased flow of information simply produces a demand for more. Rather, and consistent with the precepts of Uncertainty Reduction Theory, the provision of information reduced uncertainty and generated increased satisfaction with communication processes. The results from this study also illustrate how the audit can play a useful role in an organization's communication strategy. © 2002 by the Association for Business Communication.""We asked each student enrolled in a graduate-level management communica tion course to describe in wrzting a work-related communication episode that had challenged him or her. Students reported most difficulties in face-to-face oral events, particularly when required to interact with someone in a different organization or with someone who ranked higher in the organization. Students also identified communication-related needs (for example, improved self-confidence and persuasiveness). Our results indicate that graduate management communication courses should include oral communication and should not conceptualize oral communication exclusively in terms of formal presentations. © 1996 By the Association for Business Communication.""Hospitals have encountered significant changes since implementing the hospitalist model. The changes have been most prevalent in the communication between patients, primary care physicians, specialists, and hospitalists. This comparative case study examines hospitalists' and patients' perceptions of communication challenges. During interviews, hospitalists reported that most of their communication challenges related to patients and their families. But during group sessions, hospitalists reported that less than one third of their communication challenges related to patients and their families. A comparison of patients' and hospitalists' perceptions demonstrates that there are critical gaps in patient education that affect patients' care and their trust in their caregivers. © The Author(s) 2013.""In the first part of this article, we analyze a number of communication challenges and relate them to problems in conveying the November draft of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. Based on our analysis, the second part of our article offers a number of recommendations for improving the comprehensibility of the WCAG 2.0 for its various intended audiences. Although our discussion has the November draft as its focal point, the recommendations are more widely applicable to other complex documents with diverse audiences. In the final part, we propose a new vision for the WCAG."An overview is given on communication channels used by technical writers to obtain and verify information throughout the documentation process.

In the study, 276 participants working in various industries completed measures of communication competence and leadership styles about their direct supervisor along with measures of their job satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment. As predicted, effective and appropriate communication were both positively related to satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment. Furthermore, task- and relations-oriented leadership styles were both positively related to all three employee outcomes as well. Finally, regression analysis determined that effective communication and relations-oriented leadership were the best predictors of satisfaction, motivation, and organizational commitment. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study focuses the role of communication competencies in the appraisal process by which superiors make overall judgments about the performance of subordinates. The study is based on the hypothesis that superiors' perceptions of specific communication competencies of subordinates are related to the superiors' overall perceptions of subor dinate performance. The results support this hypothesis. A multivariate analysis reveals that employees rated highly for overall performance were also rated significant ly higher on the combined communication competencies than were their more lowly-rated counterparts. The discriminant model including the four communication competencies account for 59 percent of the variance with superiors'ratings of overall employee performance. © 1989, Sage Publications.

Analysis of variance provides firm data for accepting this hypothesis. This lack of relationship is attributed to the type of communication used, i. e. , motivational type, to the experimental base of attitudes, and to the respondents high tolerance for complexity. The study also finds subjects downgrade the message rather than its source. Writers are urged to communicate neither down to, nor up to, but at a target population. Each message should be created for a specific purpose, to be communicated to a unique audience, for a particular situation and for achieving a certain desired effect.""Although several factors are related to employee morale in organiza tional settings, the single most influential factor in enhancing job satis faction and group cohesiveness is superior-subordinate communication. Yet, while a great deal of speculation exists concerning the sorts of com munication behaviors most conducive to employee satisfaction, no em pirical test has been conducted to assess specifically the relationship between communication and morale. This study undertakes such an investigation. © 1978, Sage Publications.

This paper argues that this assumption defines communication as a preliminary skill to be learned as a prelude to technical study. An alternative view perceives increasing sophistication in the technical disciplines as requiring a simultaneous increase in sophistication in communication. The Program in Scientific and Technical Communication at the University of Washington is designed according to the latter view. Our courses address the needs of engineers as these needs emerge and change across the academic and professional life of the engineer."The Open University of Britain is concerned with teaching at a distance. Most of its courses are at the undergraduate level and its degrees are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in a series of unit- or half-credit courses studied mainly at home. The basic educational strategy is to deliver various kinds of study material to a student's home by post or by public service broadcasting and to support it with a limited amount of remedial teaching by local tutors in 250 study centers distributed around the country. It is shown that the main further development needed is to improve the remedial components of the system and several developments toward this goal are described. These include computer-based information retrieval and educational systems; a dedicated teleconferencing network; and use of the standard TV set coupled, for example, to an audio-cassette recorder, a telephone line, and a light pen.""In an effort to bridge the gap between classroom experience and “real world” activity, the authors developed a survey instrument for measuring the accounting professional's expectations of the newly hired employee's communication skills. After collecting the results of the survey, including responses from accounting educators and recently graduated accountants, the authors were able to conclude that some general agreement did exist about the communication needs of accountants: most lack the skill to articulate conceptual ideas. But there seems to be very little agreement on how to develop this skill in the classroom. © 1979, Sage Publications.

This miscommunication was caused by several factors, including managers and engineers interpreting data from different perspectives and the difficulty of believing and then sending bad news, especially to superiors or outsiders.

The concept that an organization's actions or inaction constrain or enhance its future options and outcomes and-ultimately-its long-term survival, is the organization's viability. We discuss two facilitating conditions-presence awareness and organizational identification-and three organizational issues influencing the two communication practices that affect organizational viability-organizational members' perceived environmental uncertainty, organizational members' perceived scarcity of time, and feedback cycles between actions and outcomes that shape and are shaped by their temporal focus. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""A hypothetical situation introduces the reader to the software consultant, an independent businessman who writes computer programs for others and who is a professional communicator. With the customer and a systems analyst to assist the customer, the consultant engages in a communication process which is the core of his business. Each of the three parties has different goals and abilities which affect the design and development of the computer programs. By the use of a simple communication model, a typical software development project is reviewed. Communication is seen as a composite for the project, with the process at each stage forming part of the whole. The paper is descriptive in nature, leaving development of a prescriptive model for the software consultant to future investigation.""The greatest productivity emerges from ″I'm OK - You're OK″ adult-adult transactions, and verbal and nonverbal cues in the communications environment elicit non-OK responses.

The findings indicate a clear need for more emphasis on oral and written communication and suggest that one solution to the problem is a course requirement in written and oral communication in conjunction with one or two full-time faculty dedicated to the subject. The findings also indicate that full-time faculty who teach communication courses at the graduate level have extensive business and academic experience, and their compensation is well within national guidelines. The study indicates clearly that exit requirements, when they exist, lack both an oral and written communication component, although a written term project for coursework is almost universally employed.

In internal reports, research findings are communicated primarily to engineering and management groups. Because of the specific needs and preferences of these groups, the criteria for internal reports are different from those usually considered best for an outside publication. For the same reason, oral presentations in a company differ from those for a professional society meeting. The criteria for communication inside and outside a company are compared since physics graduates entering industry must be made aware of these differences - preferably before they graduate.""The format and structure of 150 Spanish-language letters written by business administrators in Guatemalan firms were analyzed to help determine how Latin American business writers organize and present information in various types of routine letters. Findings suggest that Latin American businesspeople follow some, but not all, of the format conventions typical of those used in the United States; that they tend not to use buffers to present bad news; and that they do not consistently place topic sentences at any particular part of business letters. Understanding the differences between U.S. and Latin American business communication practices as illustrated by this study should help instructors to prepare their students to communicate successfully with their future counterparts in all parts of the Western Hemisphere. © 2004, Sage Publications.

Rather than relying on the classic concept of information as the probability of items in a series, the article discusses information value with respect to reader background and to the distribution of ″new″ information (not known to the reader, or not focused) and ″old″ (known, presupposed, mentioned) information. It is argued that this perspective is best suited for the presentation of grammar in the teaching of technical writing, with special regard for the focusing techniques of written as opposed to spoken English; examples are provided.""Although adopting self-directed work teams (SDWTs) presents a challenge, this study shows that subordinates' perceptions of managers' influence strategies affect the success of change within organizations. Using data collected over 18 months, this study examined employees' perceptions of managerial communication used prior to and during the implementation of SDWTs at a manufacturing firm as well as the effect of team and organizational communication on team members' participation. First, the results indicated that managers who communicated persuasively using ""soft"" influence tactics in the team development process were perceived to be more effective. Second, team communication was found to have a significant positive effect on team members' participation. Thus, the findings provide strong support for use of soft influence tactics in managerial communications when implementing SDWTs. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communication.""Engineering teams are often globally distributed and comprise participants from multiple disciplines and cultures who rely on professional communication support. Companies, organizations, and institutions increasingly embrace these virtual teams and use a variety of information and communication technologies to support synchronous and asynchronous team interaction (e.g., chat, videoconferencing, email, group support systems, instant messaging, and forums). More and more, communication takes place without being face-to-face. Students should be prepared for such a workplace. However, it is difficult to emulate the specifics of real-world projects in a 100-hour university course. One way to bring the real world into the classroom is by combining the efforts of 100 students into a 10,000-hour project. This paper describes the Hong Kong-Netherlands project (HKNet) as an example of an integrated learning activity among multiple international institutions that brings the reality of engineering management with professional communication into educational contexts. Virtual teams comprising students from different parts of the world build websites on specific software topics that are then integrated into a single product. HKNet has entered its tenth year, and over 1000 students have participated. © 2008 IEEE.""Communication skills are an increasingly important component of college students' education because these skills are in high demand from employers. This study provides a close examination of communication instruction in both a typical landscape architecture class and a modified one (i.e., with the addition of formalized communication instruction that is grounded in design), analyzing changes in students' perceptions of their own communication abilities (self-efficacy). The study reveals that in the typical class, students had a decrease in self-efficacy whereas in the modified class, students had a significant increase in self-efficacy. Viewing these results through the lens of self-efficacy and situated learning provides a complex understanding of the influences on students' experiences. For both teaching and research in communication across the curriculum, this study has implications about the importance of the nature of instruction. © The Author(s) 2013.""A survey of syllabi of MBA communication courses suggests that the ""typical"" MBA course focuses on skill development and integrates both speaking and writing, often with emphasis on speech.

However, fewer attempts have been made to apply communication metaphors to understand the dynamics of interfirm relations, or offshore partnerships. While all outsourcing contracts pose well-understood challenges, offshoring partnerships are often further complicated by culture and maturity/capability differences. Our analysis employs the results of a case study to delineate the different conversational metaphors that emerged from four discrete phases of offshore information systems development. Offshore success is contingent upon successful technical communication which is mediated through communication metaphors-in-use between vendor and client. In instances where management cannot directly dictate emergent conversational styles, it can determine organizational structure, coordination processes, contract and device incentives, and task allocation in order to cultivate a communication metaphor-in-use most appropriate to the specific phase of the offshore partnership, thereby mitigating many of the complications posed by culture and maturity differences. © 2007 IEEE.""A discussion is presented of the relevance and utility of communication theory and models in the research, design and development of computer-mediated information systems. Toward this end, the underlying communication model of early management information systems (MIS), termed the information-transfer (IT) model, is derived. In particular, MIS are examined from seven aspects: epistemological and ideological bases, context, agents, problems addressed, nature and role of communication. The widely acknowledged failures of early MIS are traced to shortcomings of the underlying IT model. A model reflecting recent developments in communication theory is also presented, and state-of-the-art information systems are described and critiqued with reference to both communication models. 41 refs.""This study examined the relationship between re-invention implementation and employee communication network variables (activity, size, diversity, and integrative ness) in a field study of 137 employees from a corporate office.

A fantasy sport is a simulation game in which game players act as owners to build, manage, and coach imaginary teams that compete against one another, based on statistics generated by actual players or teams of a professional sport. In line with this, we have seen the emergence of various forms of media content being produced directly for those who participate in fantasy sports games - the most prolific example of this is writing for fantasy sports. This study aims to establish an understanding of how fantasy sport articles are currently being constructed by assessing the contributions of professional journalists and amateur writers. Research questions: RQ1: If the standardization of written discourse genres stems from the reciprocity between generic conventions and the responses to situations, then what are the differences between the discourse strategy used by professional journalists and that by their amateur counterparts in fantasy sports writing? RQ2: What are the writers' rhetorical goals and the reader-writer relationships they wish to establish through the fantasy sports texts? Literature review: This study is rooted in the notion of genre, a communicative event through which the writer and reader interact to make meanings in a particular context. Communication of fantasy sports involves the production of content that provides readers with news, analysis, and opinions about - and knowledge of - matters that concern the games, thus creating pools of intelligence which other fantasy sports players can use, add to, argue against, or ignore. This amateur-produced content and resulting knowledge communities formed by fantasy sports players have led to a genre development that professional communicators should examine because it reflects so much technical documentation and instructions have migrated into user-generated spaces. 'The move' in genre analysis is a meaningful rhetorical unit that is related to the communicative purpose of a social activity and that contributes to the text's overall strategy within its situational context. Moves operate in coherence rather than isolation in a text. Methodology: A discourse analysis was conducted on 60 fantasy sports texts (30 by professional journalists and 30 by amateur writers) randomly selected from a few specific sources in 2012. A custom move scheme was devised for analyzing fantasy sports texts in this study. The results were analyzed using a chi-square test. Results and discussion: Results reveal significant differences between the discourse strategy used by professional journalists and that by amateur writers. These differences include amateur writers differing to some extent in their rhetorical goals from professional journalists as they offer media consumers a more balanced spread of information, that professional journalists place a substantially lower value on making predictions, that amateur writers and professional journalists share similar regard in terms of the appropriate amount of casualness to include in their writing although amateur writers are more included to build casualness in their articles, and that the use of writing techniques to invite further connection or engagement from readers is being underutilized by both professional and amateur writers. The major implications for the professional communicators are the insights into user-generated content, an approach in which organizations increasingly rely on for their product and service documentation. © 2015 IEEE.""Many of today's telecommuters are knowledge workers who require substantial communications to perform their jobs. This research investigates the nature of communication links between individuals in two work groups comprised of both telecommuters and nontelecommuters. Communication network analysis is used to map the communications in the groups and identify blocks of individuals. Blocks are groups of individuals with high levels of communication linkages among them. Work setting, gender, job type, tenure, and number of telecommuting days are investigated as potential factors in determining individuals' membership in blocks. There appears to be a tendency for telecommuters to communicate more with other telecommuters as well as for females to communicate more with one another. However, only job type was statistically related to block membership. These results indicate that there is a limited impact of telecommuting on the communication structure of work groups, which should reduce potential concerns of telecommuters about being left out of the office network. They should also reduce managers' concerns about having knowledge transfer and assimilation of corporate culture differences between telecommuting and nontelecommuting employees.""A “self-report” communication diary was maintained for a period of one working week by 101 managers in a variety of Australian public and private sector organizations. The results confirm prior research and add substantially to our understanding of the relationship between key demographic variables, e.g., organizational function, education, public vs. private sector; and selected communication characteristics, e.g., numbers and types present, use of face-to-face vs. interposed media, time spent on work vs. nonwork activities. These findings have important implications for the way managers use their time and are trained. © 1982, Sage Publications.

These difficulties arise not only from the physical dispersion, the large numbers of people involved, and the trend towards compartmentalization, but also from complex personal factors. In order to overcome them, management needs to recognize the unique, dynamic qualities of each communications situation. Each problem requires careful analysis, in an effort to find a solution appropriate to the particular situation, rather than reliance on a general, nonspecific communications system.""Does the quality of a communication process or product matter? This paper provides an approach to answering that question. The author provides a working definition of communication quality that focuses on its technical, functional (use), and aesthetic components and posits a discrepancy-based approach to assessing quality. Based on that analysis, the author develops testable, theoretical propositions that predict relationships among communication quality, effectiveness, and efficiency. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study sought to evaluate some structural influences on perceived communication adequacy in a multi-branch banking organization. Since communication satisfaction affects employee job satisfaction as well as productivity, this study explored factors which may impede effective information transmission. This study used a communication audit to determine which groups within the banking system were experiencing dissatisfaction with communication received. Analysis of variance showed that part-time employees were signifi cantly less satisfied than hourly workers. Explanations of rising expectations, as well as local interference with corporate-based communication efforts are explored, and the audit approach is recommended for similar eualuations. © 1988, Sage Publications.

The variables are the occasion, the author, the subject, the purpose, the supporting facilities, time, the communication itself, and the recipient. The processes are the preparation, transmission and consideration and use of the communication. The success of the communication is governed largely by the effectiveness with which the author evaluates the situation and produces a communication appropriate to the attainment of purposes. Fortuitous circumstances beyond the control of the author may affect the likelihood that the communication will be successful.""In any situation in which a written communication is produced, eight variables and three processes are present.

The ability to interact with all potential stakeholders in an organization, to clearly document requirements, and to effectively express ideas has long been recognized by researchers and practitioners as critical success factors. This study examines how communication skills of IS professionals during a development project are viewed by three different stakeholders. Specifically, each of three stakeholder groups is examined to determine the extent to which a gap between expectations and perceived performance leads to lower satisfaction of the system of the users, lower perceived job performance by IS managers, or less career satisfaction for the IS professionals. A matched survey indicates that user satisfaction and job performance ratings by managers are related to a perceived failure to meet expectations, but that IS professionals do not relate career satisfaction directly to a lack in these skills. Organizations looking for success in the IS function must take steps to improve the communication skills of the IS professionals to the level expected by other stakeholders.""Communication skills training is not well established in the British university criteria. For a long time, it has been a neglected issue priority being given to the acquisition of technical skills. A research project carried out at Aston University examined the question of how communication skills could most effectively be provided for engineering students. From information received from people experienced in the field, interesting differences were noted among courses held in a number of British institutes of higher education. Such differences included the background of the lecturer (usually engineering or communication), the timing of the course in the degree program, and syllabus selection focusing on academic and industrially related skills. Accordingly, a series of recommendations was made concerning course development at Aston University. The main conclusion is that a joint collaborative approach between an engineering department and a communication specialist is likely to be most successful. Further attention also needs to be paid to the specific skills required by practicing engineers in industry.""Spce laser communication at a data rate of 1000 megabits per second will be tested in the early 1980s using a solid-state Nd:YAG laser (solid-state crystal of yttrium aluminum garnet doped with neodymium atoms to a concentration of about one atomic percent). The space system, now under development with the Air Force 405B Program, will evaluate a Nd:YAG laser transmitter in a satellite positioned at synchronous altitude, sending data over a 40,000-km range to a ground station at Cloudcroft, NM. Even though the Nd:YAG laser may be inefficient on an absolute power scale, it enables the most efficient transmission of extremely wideband data at a rate unequalled today. The laser system has already demonstrated transmission of 1000 megabits of data per second at input power levels acceptable in a satellite.""Although over 11 million virtual workers in this country are classified as teleworkers, we know relatively little about them. Drawing on the construct of telepresence, the relationships among four sets of variables seem especially important: actual communication technology use, identifications with aspects of work, degree of virtuality, and various teleworker demographic characteristics. A survey of 86 teleworkers in a wide range of organizations revealed that basic telephone and voicemail are the most frequently used and most vital communication technologies; however, several differences in technology use based on message content and interaction partners also exist. Additionally, moderately virtual teleworkers are more identified with their work team, organization, and occupation than are those who telework small or large portions of their work week. Also, use of advanced phone technologies is most predictive of organizational and occupational identification. Among the implications discussed are equipping teleworkers with appropriate communication technologies and establishing telework programs where workers are only virtual for a portion of the work week.""The article discusses the results of a survey of communication and testing practices in university business divisions that are recognized by the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

The author gives examples of how communication theory principles affect the products of letters and reports, and quotes from business communication textbooks to illustrate his points. The author states that it is important for communication students to learn about theorists such as Harold Lasswell, Paul Lazersfeld, and Kurt Lewin.""Drawing on an earlier study that views CEO communication as an important strategic tool, this study analyzes the content of CEO messages on Web sites of major corporations in Greater China to reveal their extratextual and intratextual characteristics. The study suggests that the language style employed in these messages, including the linguistic characteristics, regional themes, and interlingual themes, is associated with a corporate communication strategy that is underpinned by CEOs’ beliefs and rooted in cultural values. The findings enhance our understanding of how CEOs view their stakeholders and the content that they include in their messages to stakeholders in order to compete in this digital age. © The Author(s) 2014.""It can be argued that process redesign has a long history, going as Jar back as Taylor's scientific management and reaching its peak in the 1990s with business process re-engineering. Throughout most of its history, operational-level approaches to process redesign maintained a focus on ""workflows,"" or the chronological flows of activities in processes. It is argued in this paper that while this makes some sense in materials transformation processes whose final product usually is a tangible manufactured item (e.g., a car engine), this orientation is fundamentally inconsistent with the communication-intensive nature of the vast majority of processes found in organizations today. This paper attempts to show that a focus on communication flow representations and methods is likely to lead to better process redesign outcomes than is a focus on representations and methods in connection with ""workflows."" It does so by developing a set of research questions based on the communication flow optimization model and answering those questions in the context provided by three process redesign projects conducted at a defense contractor in the U.S.""The authors undertook a survey of the attitudes of personnel officers of 250 large organizations concerning the need for communication courses at the graduate level.

Such historical studies are necessary to help researchers understand the often complicated origins of genre conventions in professional discourse. Historical research that draws on contemporary genre theory helps address this void. A genre perspective is particularly valuable for helping researchers trace a given type of document's emergence and evolution. This perspective also provides a way of accounting for the connections between communicative practices and the other activities that occupy the attention of workplace organizations. To illustrate what this perspective brings to historical research in professional communication, I examine the development of communicative practices at a national production company that relied on texts to mediate its organizational activities across geographically dispersed locations. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc."This article suggests that managerial awareness of ordinarily unconscious communicative rules (and how these rides potentially influence decision-making processes) might help managers to be more intentional about their communicative choices and may therefore lead to better decisions. The article explores the impact of communicative rules on decision-making processes using the retrospective discourse surrounding the decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger as an example case. Communicative rides may have played a part in the course of the eve of the launch debate over whether to launch the Challenger. Four potential communicative rides are identified using quotations from the presidential hearing transcripts. Being aware of communicative rides may be especially important in decision-making situations because it can enable one to make conscious choices concerning communicative behavior instead of unconsciously following intuitive social norms-norms that might have undesirable along with unintended results. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication."In Ireland, technical communication has developed as an academic and occupational field since the late 20th century. Research on the field in Ireland is limited. Research questions: (1) To what extent do technical communicators in Ireland operate as a community of practice? (2) What steps are Irish technical communicators taking toward professionalization? Literature review: This study uses a theoretical framework that combines symbolic interactionism and communities of practice theories. While traditional professionalization theory uses a structural functionalist approach to the study of occupations, characterizing disciplines as professions depending on whether they meet certain traits (including autonomy, market closure, license to practice, and service orientation), symbolic interactionism prioritizes interactions among individuals. In this sense, it overlaps with the concerns of communities of practice. A community of practice involves a group of people working together, and creating meaning through their interactions. Studying an occupation through this lens foregrounds individual and community identity, and how that is formed and informed by work. Methodology: Mixed methods - a survey, focus groups, and interviews - were used to explore Irish technical communicators' perceptions of aspects of their field: practice, education, value and status, and professional and community structures. Results: The findings indicate that Irish technical communicators exhibit traits of communities of practice (such as joint enterprise and shared repertoires). They also identify with their job title and practice. A key finding is that some Irish technical communicators have a keen appetite for community involvement. This enthusiasm notwithstanding, barriers to professionalization include low visibility of the role in Ireland, limited evidence of professionalizing activity, and the potential for career stagnation. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Community service learning offers a unique and rewarding way for business students to reinforce communication capabilities while developing lifelong career and social skills. This article defines community service learning, dis cusses its importance to business as well as higher education, and describes three community service learning projects.

This case study details a community-based research project between nonprofit staff at a community health center and UX professionals to improve the design and usability of a document designed to help immigrant patients sign up for health insurance. UX professionals may need to adapt and be flexible with their efforts, but can offer valuable skills to community partners. Research questions: (1) What are the information needs and barriers faced by immigrant populations signing up for health insurance? (2) How does a usability study, adapted to meet the needs of immigrant populations, inform the design of a supplemental guidebook about health insurance? (3) What are the challenges and opportunities when engaging in community-based UX research projects? Situating the case: Other community-based research projects in technical communication and UX point to the need for a clear conceptualization of participation, a strong partnership with nonprofits, and the need to develop meaningful and actionable insights. Furthermore, when conducting studies with immigrant populations, the role of the translator on the research team is crucial. Methodology: As a community-based research project focused on the collaborative generation of practical knowledge, we conducted a usability study with 12 participants in two language groups, Chinese and Vietnamese, to evaluate the design and usability of a guidebook designed to provide guidance about enrolling in a health insurance plan. Data were analyzed to identify usability concerns and used to inform a second iteration of the guidebook. About the case: Immigrant populations struggle to sign up for health insurance for a variety of reasons, including limited English and health insurance literacy. As a result, a nonprofit community health center developed a guidebook to support immigrant populations. Version 1 of this guidebook was evaluated in a usability study, with results showing that users struggled to correctly choose a plan, determine their eligibility, and interpret abstract examples. As a result, Version 2 was designed to support the in-person experience, reduce visual complexity, and support patients' key questions. Conclusions: Community-based UX collaborations can amplify the expertise of UX and nonprofit professionals. However, UX methods may need to be adapted in community-based projects to better incorporate local knowledge and needs. © 2017 IEEE.""Standards for information quality can help content developers within a company or enterprise create high-quality, high-value content, as well as an excellent user experience for its clients. This article explains how the content development community at IBM created meaningful standards, as well as the metrics to track their impact, as part of a closed-loop information quality process. Method: Instead of having one group dictate what the standards will be, the content developers at IBM worked together as a community to identify key requirements from internal and external sources, tested the standards with a set of key products, and then put the standards to use in increasingly larger numbers of products. Results: A community-driven approach to information quality standards allowed the IBM content developers to create standards that were meaningful to a variety of teams, ensuring that key aspects of information quality were addressed throughout the corporation. The use of metrics to track implementation and compliance allowed the IBM community to see when the standards were working, and when the standards needed to be updated to meet the changing needs of their clients. Conclusions: Implementing information quality standards is an admirable goal, but it should not be the end of a company's information quality journey. This should be considered a closed loop or wheel, with continual analysis of compliance data, client feedback, and other metrics driving continual improvements in information quality.""Although “community” is an important concept for writing, writers have been unclear about how a sense of community relates to the writing process or to the documents produced. This study reports a comparison of several technical reports showing the influences of a writer's identification with a community on features of the resulting document. Features most affected were personal and community references within the document, writer's stance toward the reader, and definition of the rhetorical problem. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A review of formal (“black letter”) and common law indicates that apologies generally do not constitute evidence of guilt and that, in fact, they sometimes have positive consequences for the apologist. Persons who practice (or teach) crisis communication should avoid the mistake of relying on an over-simplified and inaccurate understanding of the legal issues surrounding corpo rate apologies. © 2003, Sage Publications.

Writing style and use of graphics are important considerations: ″readability″ may be assesed. The technique is illustrated with an analysis of two articles on the same subject from different publications. Although the technique is intended chiefly as a teaching tool, some of the principles involved may be useful to others interested in judging the character of publications in a field, perhaps to help select the most suitable outlet for an article or to aid in designing a paper for a specific publication.""A comparative evaluation of two user guides-the document traditionally used by a company and a model document designed on the basis of research results and recommendations-was carried out using a number of complementary approaches focusing on the user. The quality and suitability of these documents for the target audience were assessed in terms of content, structure, presence of certain organizational devices (such as headings) and pictures included. The results revealed that the model document was more attractive, more efficient, and better adapted to users' needs, thanks to its modular organization (being structured according to ""functions""), a large number of pictures, the presence of headings, and rationalization of the vocabulary used.""Discusses the literature recommending modifying editing comments for nonnative English speakers Examines the data from a survey about editing to determine whether differences existed between groups of respondents on the basis of characteristics relating to culture, age, gender, and professional association.""An increasing number of companies are introducing artificial agents as self-service tools on their websites, often motivated by the need to provide cost-efficient interaction solutions. These agents are designed to help customers and clients to conduct their business on the website. Their role on commercial websites is often to act as online sales/shopping assistants with the hope of replacing some of the interactions between customers and sales staff, thus supplementing or replacing human-to-human communication. However, research on artificial agents and comparisons with human-to-human communication, in particular, is still scarce. The purpose of this article is to explore the similarities and differences in communication between an artificial agent and customers compared with face-to-face communication between human service providers and customers. The method employed is a qualitative comparison of face-to-face human service provision in a travel agency setting and logs of interactions between customers and an artificial agent on an airline company website. The analysis is based on the theory of ""activity-based communication analysis"" and makes use of a framework of specific communication features provided by this theory. The article demonstrates a number of deficiencies in communication between artificial embodied agents and humans, suggesting that artificial embodied agents still lack many of the desirable communicative aspects of human-to-human service encounters. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Technical communication instructors want to help students, as well as professionals, design effective PowerPoint presentations. Toward this end, I compare the advice of academic and industry experts about effective PowerPoint presentation design to survey responses from university students about slide text, visual elements, animations, and other issues related to PowerPoint presentation design and delivery. Based on this comparison, I suggest some topics, such as PowerPoint's Slide Sorter view, that technical communication instructors and other presentation instructors might address when they cover presentations in their classes or seminars.""Veteran technical writers and editors sometimes suspect that the professors who teach technical writing and editing are too deeply immersed in their academic culture to translate effectively into the classroom the world of work culture in which technical writing and editing are practiced. In fact, the two cultures are remarkably alike, sharing the same goal—to improve communication. Differences arise primarily in the approaches taken to achieve that common goal. Drawing upon the author’s 25 years of experience as a technical writer and editor and his more recent experience as a Visiting Professor in a university writing program, this paper discusses the different approaches that industry and academe take to such topics as grammar, rhetoric, audience, editing, artwork, decision making, and collaborative writing. © 1991 IEEE"The purpose of this paper is to afford the speech instructor with a knowledge of the scientific paper format and to compare that format with the problem/solution speech pattern used in speech courses."Previous empirical findings from the computer-mediated communication research literature are consistent with media richness theory because they suggest that the use of electronic communication media is likely to have a negative impact on the success and outcome quality of process improvement groups. These findings lead to the expectation that electronic communication media will not be as appropriate as the face-to-face medium to support the type of complex and knowledge-rich communication that takes place in process improvement groups. This paper analyzes 12 process improvement groups interacting through an electronic communication medium and finds this expectation unfounded. In fact, the use of an electronic communication medium can actually have the opposite effect, that is, a ""positive"" effect, on process improvement group success and outcome quality. Two other theoretical models, namely the compensatory adaptation and social influence models, are used to explain these counterintuitive findings.""This study uses qualitative content analysis to discuss current perspectives in technical communication pedagogy. It examines the 1990-94 issues of five major scholarly journals - a collection of 563 articles - to identify 98 articles mentioning teaching in undergraduate technical communication courses. Influenced by differing theoretical and practical approaches, the 98 articles were classified according to four pedagogical perspectives: (1) the functional perspective, based on empirical research and workplace experience; (2) the rhetorical perspective, based in scholarship in the humanities and influenced by rhetorical theory; (3) the ideological perspective, also based on scholarship in the humanities but influenced by critical theory; and (4) the intercultural and feminist perspective, a bridging perspective based on both empirical research and critical theory. This article discusses the four perspectives in terms of the educational goals of communicative competence (the ability to use language to succeed in the workplace) and social critique (the ability to question existing social structures and to envision cultural change). © 1996 Sage Publications, Inc.""Business case studies have been a standard pedagogical tool in technical communication classrooms. However, the expansion of engineering practice-including the design and implementation of appropriate technology in the developing world-suggests the need to complement such studies. This paper analyzes three business and three humanitarian case studies. It highlights the complexities of audience and context that distinguish the humanitarian case studies, and it argues that incorporating humanitarian cases into technical communication courses would promote higher levels of learning, student engagement, and the global citizenship that will be requisite for all engineers in the twenty-first century. © 2009 IEEE.""This article provides a snapshot of how industry leaders currently conceptualize our identities and relationships, as well as some of the challenges we continue to face as a profession. Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews. Results: Technical communicators are functioning as agile, adaptable, and multispecialists in a broad range of organizational functions. They have become increasingly visible and valuable assets throughout a project lifecycle, and in many cases are able to define their own roles, which include team leadership and management responsibilities. Conclusion: Technical communicators continue to serve in core functional responsibilities in a wide range of industries. © 2015, Technical Communication.

In such settings, teams organized to produce special documents may include members who do little or no writing for their regular jobs and thus lack experience in generating and selecting ideas, particularly in group settings. In the case study discussed here, the issue of authority provided a subtle but powerful undercurrent during the lifespan of one writing project. The collective and individual voices of team members indicated a constant tug between deep-seated expectations born of traditional systems of hierarchy in organizations and the new responsibilities of making contributions in team settings. Although environmental supports for authentic involvement seemed to be in place, those supports alone could not guarantee the sharing of authority. © 1995 IEEE.""This article describes the types of photographs used in technical journals and discusses general principles of artistic composition, aspects of background planning and research that must precede any actual shooting, and techniques and methods of using the actual photographic equipment to achieve the desired results.""Much of today's CRT photocomposition is being processed through computer systems from typed OCR input or from magnetic tapes. Both approaches have some attraction for publishers who may have the capability of preparing such input within their own editorial offices, or from available computerized master files of data. Advantages of these procedures and some problems which have been encountered are discussed. The importance of personnel selection and training, attention to details of specifications, and equipment maintenance are emphasized. With careful programming, data files can frequently be converted into typesetting language, selecting and rearranging material to meet a publisher's needs.""Composition at ASCE has progressed in 20 years from hot type to author-prepared camera-ready copy, to IBM Executive typing, to math by hanger keys, to multilevel mathematics on the cathode-ray tube (CRT). ASCE's technical journals have incorporated each of these nonfederally subsidized innovations to deliver better, faster, lower cost final products in 13 journals that include about 13,000 pages per year and indexing of 5,000 articles, papers, and discussions per year from staff-typed optical-character-recognition material prepared by an editor, half-time, and an editorial assistant. Civil Engineering magazine, the biennial membership directory, and annual committee personnel listings are also computer composed.""This article builds upon the work of Richard Haswell's ""NCTE/CCCC's Recent War on Scholarship"" by providing an alternative framework for empirical inquiry based on principles of skepticism. It examines the literature relating to empirical research and argues that one of the issues at hand is the perceived link of empirical research to positivism, which clashes with the dominant social constructivist paradigm. It draws upon classical rhetoric and the work of radial empiricist William James to formulate an alternative framework for empirical research based on skeptical principles.""The first section sketches a broad historical framework in which to understand the emergence of the computer and the profession of technical communication and sets the stage by concluding that the computer is both part of the technological milieu which needs technical communicators and a tool which communicators can use. Then comes a brief review of computer applications in terms of numerical, nonnumerical, and communicaion applications and dumb, clever, and intelligent program functions. Then the author argues that advances in computer science will narrow the gap between writing computer programs and documenting them to the point where technical communicators in the software field will be programmers. The final section suggests that computing technology will give technical communicators professional autonomy comparable to that currently enjoyed by doctors and lawyers.""Educators have been attempting for several years to improve student communication skills through the use of computer-assisted instruction (CAI). While numerous studies have attempted to measure the effects of using CAI, results have been inconsistent and inconclusive. Most studies reveal that both students and faculty possess a positive feeling toward CAI but that students do not experience significant improvement in writing as a result of using Writer's Workbench. This experimental study focused on student groups that used Writer's Workbench, considered the grandfather of all text analysis programs, and found that business students do not perceive a significant improvement in writing after using Writer's Workbench. Students who used Writer's Workbench did, however, perceive significant improvement in their oral communication skills. © 1991, Sage Publications.

The program is adaptive in the sense that it uses statistics from the document itself for its analysis. In a first pass through the document, a table of digram and trigram frequencies is prepared. The second pass through the document breaks out individual words and compares the digrams and trigrams in each word with the frequencies from the table. An index is given to each world which reflects the hypothesis that the trigrams in the given word were produced from the same source that produced the trigram table. The words are sorted in decreasing order of their indices and printed. Appendices containing 2,726 common technical English words, possible typo's and spelling errors are included."Provides an overview of gaming definitions and genres Argues that games provide a rich area for research and theory building in technical communication Details a five-part framework for mapping game activity to technical communication interests."Authors have developed a method of using simple, commercially available computer simulations to create productive writing cases.

Early use of these programs indicates that the computer is making itself indispensable to the writing teacher.""This is a case history of the activities involved in acquiring and operating a large computer-based text-processing system coupled with a phototypesetter, developing a cadre of compositors, attracting special users, managing chargeback, and planning enhancement. It lists the principal lessons learned from each endeavor, and concludes that the system has served well for the production of reports, manuals, and specifications.""Most research on writing has focussed on the work of single authors working by hand on prose texts. However, much professional work is collaborative, computer-based, not exclusively prose, and not well studied. Some preliminary research suggests that the use of computers will affect the cognitive activities of individual authors in several domains of immediate relevance to composition and technical communication practitioners: planning activities, editing activities, the writing of novice computer users or poor typists, and writing for electronic mail and other electronic communication. Research reported in this paper suggests that the rapidly increasing capability of computer-based writing systems will force communication researchers to 1) broaden their basic conception of and methods of studying 'author' to include authoring teams, 2) broaden the type of material studied from that which is purely or largely textual to that which much more frequently includes other types of information, and 3) track changes in 'genre conventions' resulting from the increased capabilities of computer-based systems - in short, to assess the impacts of the medium on the message.""With the advent of electronic networking, writing pedagogy has moved into the arena of computer-supported collaborative writing, using collaborative writing as an instructional means to promote a more social view of the writing process. Therefore, as business and technical communication researchers and instructors, we need to ask the following questions: What kinds of software have been developed to aid computer-supported collaborative writing in the workplace and in the writing classroom? What benefits and problems have resulted from the design and use of this software? What research issues should be addressed as we approach the next decade of computer-supported collaborative writing? In this article the author explores these questions, highlighting five computer-supported collaborative writing systems from the workplace and five such systems from the writing classroom. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Consistency is either 'uniform' or 'harmonious,' depending on whether a set of linked elements is indivisible or divisible into subsets. From the perspective of text characteristics, we can speak of semantic, syntactic, stylistic, spatial, and mechanical consistency. To deal successfully with consistency problems, technical communicators should establish patterns that are logical, evident, functional, resource efficient, and stable. Because of its importance, the concept of consistency should be more fully recognized. Indeed, consistency should be a component of any comprehensive rhetoric of technical communication."Language in a technical writing course can be taught from the standpoint of its function in the student's papers. Three functions can be differentiated: generative - making later discussion necessary; substantive - giving supporting material from researched sources; and conclusive - making the author's conclusions clear and apparent."The conceptual model or metaphor of a software user interface (UI) (for example, an artist's palette used by commercial drawing applications) contributes greatly to a UI's ease of learning and ease of use. When that model is unclear, does not match users' expectations, or is absent entirely, it is a major hurdle for even the most internally consistent interface to overcome. This article suggests why conceptual design is so often neglected by development teams and presents a five-step process for developing a sound conceptual model for a software application. The crux of the process is the development of multiple models and low-fidelity prototyping. There are also recommendations describing how technical communicators can reinforce and support conceptual design on their projects. Last, the author depicts how organizations committed to usability ensure that conceptual design is given the attention it deserves.""Writing Conventions - Spelling, Punctuation, and Paragraphing - have changed dramatically over the centuries, but the rules governing the placement of text on the printed page have varied little since the earliest use of letters and numbers. The reason for this is simple, says the author: there are only so many ways that text can be arranged; the printed page is a discrete, inanimate unit whose very nature dictates its form. But with the increasing use of video displays of text, new conventions are needed. Here is a thoughtful look at the problem plus some useful guidelines for solving it. (1) Remember that 'white space' is even more important on a display screen than on a printed page. (2) Use emphasis devices carefully. (3) Use consistency of position on the display screen. (4) Use 'online bookmarks'. (5) Preserve familiar metaphors. (6) Strike a balance between printed documentation and online information. (7) Avoid placing the system in control.""This article describes the objectives, methods and results of an experimental program in writing research which attempted to test the validity of the widespread notion that technical and scientific writing consists largely of the unadulterated transmission of factual information. Basing their measurement criteria on the work of J. Britton and J. Moffett, the researchers analyzed in detail sixteen samples from industry and sixteen from academia. Results clearly suggest that most technical writing operates at levels of abstraction far beyond the mere reporting of information.""What concepts characterize the study of business communication? The present analysis examined the key words occurring in 100 abstracts of articles published in The Journal of Business Communication between 1988 and 1994 to uncover the major concepts of this field of study. Results suggest a central clustering of research in the field around the frequently used concepts of ""personnel,"" ""employees,"" ""written skills,"" ""sales,"" and ""listening."" Other, more diversely associated, concepts emerged as well. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Little has been written about the organizational role of technical communicators. Using a systems approach to organizational theory, we argue that technical communicators engage in tasks that permit them to function as “boundary spanners.” As boundary spanners, technical communicators both disseminate and make sense of information required for coordination between organizational groups and for effective responses to the environment. We discuss the implications of this position for managing and educating technical communicators. © 1988, Sage Publications.

To support next-generation development efforts, a framework is proposed that will benefit the profession: integration with national efforts to develop knowledge taxonomies; conceptualization through metaphor; and application through imagined user groups (personas) and the communication tasks (genres) they commonly perform. Method: As an instrumental case study, the TCBOK can be understood and expanded through the complementary metaphors of relation and trading zones. Both metaphors are examined through a scenario of use for two personas. Results: While presently designed as taxonomy of knowledge, the TCBOK might be expanded through an ecological framework that embraces complexity of design and use. Conclusions: Three recommendations are provided that may help provide direction for TCBOK development: (1) Continue the use of persona as a key strategy for information development, but add high-quality genre models of best practice; (2) Expand attention from focus on cognitive competency domains to include intrapersonal and interpersonal domains; (3) Consider the knowledge portal as an opportunity to expand on other current efforts to articulate knowledge taxonomies.""A guided workshop in editing can give students and report writers an objective means of evaluating their drafts to improve the quality of writing. In each of four steps, the workshop uses three processes (identification, analysis, rewriting) to examine overall logic, verb usage, sentence openings, and conjunctions. Practical tips for objectively examining drafts provide the greatest improvement in editing one's own work.""Purposeful dialog is a fundamental management responsibility. The author defines the purpose of dialog as discussing problems and their solutions, and he offers ideas about the structure of intelligent dialog: defining the problem, gathering and interpreting facts, considering alternatives, and reaching decisions. Often reaching decisions depends not so much on our ability to change others' opinions as it does on our willingness to change our own. Effective dialog requires the ability to disagree without being disagreeable.""Focuses on issues that complicate educational research conducted in computer-enhanced instructional environments, such as privacy, ownership, and permissions  Reflects on these issues in terms of an actual case study and provides guidelines.""Many disabled or elderly users have embraced the Web as a way to get easier access to information, services, contacts with others, and entertainment. But very often, Web sites are creating barriers for them, at the same time as they are reducing barriers of access. We can safely assume that Web sites are made by designers who have no intention to exclude groups of users from using the site. Our studies, however, have proved that good intentions are not enough to create Web content that is accessible and also usable for people with various kinds of physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. Web designers need to familiarize themselves with accessibility guidelines and apply them properly, but that goal is seldom achieved. Even when the guidelines are applied, a site’s ease of use for people with disabilities needs to be confirmed in a usability test with actual users who have disabilities. This article describes how to conduct user-focused tests with test participants who are elderly or who have disabilities.""Principles of and guidelines for using a conference approach, in which managers and engineers can work together successfully to improve engineers' reports, are discussed. It is argued that most managers feel underprepared for working with an engineer's writing process, but they can make a difference in the quality of the writing without overediting, rejecting, or rewriting reports. Managers need to face two related challenges when facilitating an engineer's report writing: managers can help engineers to write better, but the engineers themselves are responsible for their own writing. It is concluded that with the conference approach, both manager and engineer have clear responsibilities. The manager is responsible for listening and making suggestions, but not for rewriting or correcting line-by-line until the engineer's report looks more like the manager's report. The engineer, as the best authority on the subject and purpose, is responsible for writing and rewriting the report, and deciding whether the manager's suggestions should be adopted."This paper discusses issues in desktop publishing as they relate to the use of computer data bases.

We added verification steps and personal stories to user instructions for a cell phone, to find out how seniors (between 60 and 70 years) perceive these confidence-increasing motivational elements. Verification steps allow users to check if a procedure was carried out correctly. Personal stories describe how a fictitious user succeeded in completing a procedure. Method: The plus-minus method was used. Participants were asked to place pluses and minuses in cell phone user instructions to indicate their positive and negative reading experiences, and to explain their choices afterwards. Results: Verification steps are regarded as other, common parts of user instructions by seniors. Nineteen out of 20 participants appreciate verification steps, and they mainly encourage providing these because they are expected to decrease doubts, and increase user confidence and satisfaction. Personal stories tend to stand out compared to other, common parts of user instructions. Thirteen out of 20 participants appreciate personal stories, which use is mainly discouraged for redundancy reasons, and encouraged for their expected positive effects on user confidence and motivation. Conclusion: The use of verification steps and personal stories in user instructions seems acceptable to seniors. As a next step, it seems worth it to test for effects of these motivational elements on usability, user confidence and motivation.""This study builds upon the previous research conducted by Herold, Liden, and Leatherwood (1987). The dimensionality of the sources of feedback scale was examined using confirmatory factor analysis. The model was tested on a combined sample from two service-based organizations. Results indicated that the five factor model as originally conceived by the scale's developers had strong model to data fit; that is, the data indicated that respondents distinguished among feedback from the organization, supervisor, coworkers, task, and oneself. In addition, the outcome variables of stress, job satisfaction, role conflict, role ambiguity, and job involvement were examined. Using hierarchical multiple regression to control for the organization, it was determined that feedback from oneself and coworkers did not predict any of the outcome variables. However, feedback from task, supervisor, and organization predicted job satisfaction and role ambiguity. Only feedback from the organization predicted job involvement, role conflict, and stress. Implications for managers are discussed. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""Argues that data displays can be classified into four types: conventional, perceptual, informational, and aesthetic Maintains that conflicts among the standards can be resolved by allowing the rhetorical situation to guide the design process.""This article analyzes a CEO's use of extended epic metaphor in building corporate culture. Whereas much of the research on management's use of narrative has examined shorter stories and anecdotes, here the authors analyze the text of a speech written by a newly hired CEOfor his upper management team. The speech, which was never delivered but was instead sent out in a leadership manual to managers in the conglomerate, begins with a narrative history of the CEO's first five months in office. In his description of events, the metaphoric language suggesting heroes and competition contradicts the principles of team management that the CEO intends to implement throughout the company. These heroic metaphors valorize individual achievement, agency, and action -values more likely to be familiar to the business culture than the cooperative values of teams. Drawn from war and sports metaphors common in the language of the popular American lexicon, the images generate more excitement and appeal than those of cooperative planning inherent in team management systems.""The redefinition of logos as an appeal to logic is a mistaken association found all too often in the technical communication classroom. Logic inheres in all three proofs of persuasion; moreover, Aristotle used logos within the context of classical rhetoric to refer to the argument or speech itself. In this light, the proofs of persuasion represent the set of all logical means whereby the speaker can lead a ""right-thinking"" audience to infer something. If that something is an emotion, the appeal is to pathos; if it is about the character of the speaker, the appeal is to ethos; and if it is about the argument or speech itself, the appeal is to logos. This interpretation reinstates all three proofs of persuasion as legitimate, logical means to different proximate ends and provides a coherent definition of logos, consonant with Aristotle's Rhetoric, to the next generation of technical communicators. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Communication skills are valued highly in public accounting firms, where professionals at all levels communicate as part of their jobs. However, respondents to a 1997 survey reported that the development of effective communication skills was not part of formal accounting education and that partners and managers want their entry-level professionals to have these skills at the onset. Further, these skills increase in importance as accounting professionals progress from entry-level to manager to partner. Educational institutions need to develop programs that include communication topics and courses to prepare accountants for the challenges of their profession.""This article reports my classroom-based qualitative research, conducted at a midwestern university, on the role of World Englishes in the ethos transformation of U.S. native English-speaking students.

Efforts at internationalizing technical communication can benefit immensely from the inclusion of the World Englishes paradigm in training programs to account for students' language attitudes. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""This study compares decision processes of consensus and devil's advocacy within an additive task, a disjunctive task, and a conjunctive task structure. The results suggest that high-conflict decision processes such as devil's advocacy enhances decision making in disjunctive tasks, retards decision making in additive tasks, but has no effect on decision making in conjunctive tasks. Perceptions of the group's atmosphere were most positive within consensus groups. © 1993, Sage Publications.

Conservation writing is an umbrella term for a range of writing about ecology, biology, the outdoors, and environmental policies and ethics. It places the natural world at the center of readers' attention, often viewing sustainability as a core value. A course or curriculum in this kind of writing would likely need to help students master a variety of genres, while providing a working knowledge in environmental law, ethics, and politics. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""Government auditors collect data and assess, via written reports, the operations of a government; however, little is known about what can affect and govern their representations of those operations. This analysis examines research studies about author bias and government audit manuals in order to understand how government auditors' neutrality is threatened. While bias may be an overt function of preferential or prejudicial thoughts, most sources of bias that influence auditors derive from less explicit sources including prior expectations, media coverage, nondiagnostic information, and other significantly less direct channels. To determine how government guidelines address this issue for their auditors, the principle audit manuals for Canada and the United States were reviewed for their references to bias, impartiality, and objectivity. Neither manual provides a significant amount of guidance to assist auditors in addressing the problems of bias in data collection, interpretation, and representation. If bias is to be reduced in audit reports, more must be done. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Thanks to electronic communications technologies, interacting with individuals in other nations is often as easy as interacting with our next-door neighbors. This speed and ease of access has eroded traditional barriers of distance and has led to an interconnected global economy of unprecedented scale. These new levels of interaction and connection will undoubtedly affect individuals in all professions, and future success will certainly involve understanding and appreciating the status of key economic players. From a technical communication perspective, the People's Republic of China-more commonly referred to simply as China-is poised to become a major power in the international technical marketplace of this new century. Today's technical communicator should therefore examine how China could affect future trends in the field by looking at three key kinds of issues: economic, communication, and ethical/legal.""Results: Overall, Web design texts encourage designers to think critically about audiences. Changing technology clearly played a key role in the evolution of instruction. Finally, Web design instruction included some level of reference to cognitive learning theory or visual communication theory. While the appearance of theory-based word units in Web design texts coupled with discussion about technological capabilities and audience suggests Web design instruction does a solid job of situating design practices in theory, technology, and the complex situations in which the Web user operates, the depth of discussion varies greatly from text to text.Conclusion: The various treatments of theory in texts calls for further study to better understand which approach is more effective in communicating the theories as a whole as well as their application in Web design.Purpose: To investigate whether Web design rules historically are prescribed or whether designers are encouraged to think critically about how Web design choices relate to the complex situation of human-computer interaction. Specifically, this study explores how Web design rules have evolved since the mid-1990s and the influencing factors, if Web design instruction has dictated rules or encouraged designers to think critically about the design decisions being made, and, finally, if Web design principles are based on cognitive learning or visual communication theories, situated in best practices, or simply replicated.Method: Content analysis of a sampling of 40 textbooks and general-interest publications on Web design from 1995 to 2014. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

Drawing on an analysis of 31 corporate social media policies, this article argues that these policies create constrained agency in two ways: they establish contradictory expectations for a writer's voice by requesting both individual and corporate-friendly voices, and they create a seemingly paradoxical situation where employees both do and do not represent the company. These policies shed light on the complex constructions of agency within corporations and encapsulate the workplace tensions that accompany the affordances of social media tools. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This study suggests that documentation is a complex technical communication genre, encompassing all the texts that mediate between complex human activities and computer processes. Drawing on a historical study, it demonstrates that the varied forms given to documentation have a long history, extending back at least to the early days of commercial mainframe computing. The data suggest that (1) early forms of documentation were borrowed from existing genres, and (2) official and unofficial documentation existed concurrently, despite efforts to consolidate these divergent texts. The study thus provides a glimpse into the early experimental nature of documentation as writers struggled to find a meaningful way to communicate information about their organization's developing computer technology.""This article focuses on the analysis of the display, negotiation, and construction of competence and (professional) identity in a relatively young field of personal and professional development: coaching. Based on a corpus of German and English coaching sessions, the related study utilizes a multidisciplinary approach, combining ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis, and discursive psychology. In the analysis of a first business coaching encounter between professional and client presented in this article, competence can be seen as part of the coach's professional identity, as it is co-constructed on a moment-to-moment basis by both coach and client in and via their talk-in-interaction. While the membership categories of ""coach"" and ""client"" set the framework for the analysis, a more detailed description of the specific interactional activities of the two interactants is needed in order to get a grasp of the notions of competence and professional identity. For this analytical purpose, an extension of Zimmerman's model of identity is suggested on the level of situated identities. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper focuses on the interaction between teams of participants in the constructive interaction (CI) method. We analyzed transcripts and video recordings from five CI sessions in order to determine the types and frequencies of communicative acts performed as well as their usefulness to usability testers. In addition, we examined the contribution of the individual team members to the interaction and investigated whether the interaction took place according to a pattern of cooperation. Our analysis showed that team interaction in the CI test is highly task-oriented and hardly descriptive. For the most part, the five CI sessions contained communicative acts that are (potentially) useful to usability testers. The contribution of the team members to the interaction was largely similar in terms of types/frequencies of communicative acts, but the teams' cooperation pattern revealed that this equal contribution was no immediate guarantee for successful cooperation. To address this issue, we suggest several ways to improve the CI method. © 2006 IEEE.""Four service-learning projects were conducted in technical communication courses using wikis. Results confirm previous findings that wikis improve collaboration, help develop student expertise, and enact a ""writing with the community"" service-learning paradigm. However, wikis did not decenter the writing classroom as predicted by previous work. Instructors using wikis to scaffold client projects should calibrate standards for evaluation with students and client, and they may need to encourage clients to stay active on the wiki. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."The article discusses motivational techniques for business consultants who instruct employees on improving their writing skills. Many clients believe they do not need writing skills training because they are overconfident that their writing style is adequate. The author recommends motivation through self-analysis and presents examples from writing seminars he conducted with accountants and government employees. Executives can be motivated to improve their writing with knowledge that it improves their time management."Educators need to be more proactive in expanding course offerings to respond to the academic needs of university students. Draum by excellent pay and prospects of gaining valuable experience, more college graduates are pursuing employment in consulting. With consulting skills growing in importance for many of our students in the 21st century, business communication scholars are particularly well posi tioned to help students develop these requisite skills and knowledge. Offering a course dedicated to the topic of consulting, or including consulting experience in a standard business communication course prepares students for engaging in consult ing activities, including research, assessment, training and development, facilita tion, and evaluation. Our course foregrounds instructional frameworks and serv ice learning to assist students in systematically assessing organizational problems and designing and implementing organizational interventions. © 2002, Sage Publications.

This study examined actual toll-free number calls made by 121 respondents. Calls were evaluated for content, quality, and caller satisfaction. The findings suggest that although most call experiences were positive, there was variability in call handling and in perceptions of satisfaction. Dimensions that contributed to caller satisfaction included operator character istics such as knowledge, courtesy, and interest. Specific behaviors included apologizing for a problem, thanking the consumer for calling, and encouraging the caller to call again if the need arose. Respondents frequently noted that reducing time placed on “hold” was one way to enhance satisfaction. © 1994, Sage Publications.

The present study investigated the effects of company reputation for social responsibility prior to a crisis event, response to a crisis event, and responsibility for the event on overall consumer regard for the firm. The study is, in part, an experimental test of image restoration strategies conceptualized in the literature. Each of the three factors was found to exhibit a significant main effect. For the crisis scenario used in this study, responsibility explained the largest proportion of variance and response explained the least. An unexpected finding was that an inappropriate response by a ""bad"" company resulted in an increase in regard toward the firm, whereas the same response by a ""good"" company resulted in a decrease in regard for the firm. © 2004 by the Association for Business Communication.""The case studies in this article look at user experience issues surrounding authorized and unauthorized media distribution, describing how researchers and practitioners can trace these experiences to learn how to empower social media participants rather than criminalize them. Method: By using Actor Network Theory (ANT) to look specifically at instances involving digital rights management (DRM) issues in the United States and the European Union, we can discover how content distribution is as much an issue of protecting intellectual property as it is a critical concern for usability. Results: Amazon's response to the removal of Orwell's books, Hulu's expiration of content, and Pandora's copyright restrictions cause numerous issues for consumers attempting to access this content legally. Conclusion: As communicators, legal experts, and international policy contributors, it is imperative that we design for these experiences, rather than over and around them. Looking across these networks-documenting what technologies, organizations, and people are involved-we can create a better map of what is or will be affected by any further implementation of law or technology. By participating in spaces typically thought of as the realm of legal scholars, policy makers, and lawyers, technical communicators can be stronger user advocates for the participants of these systems.""The Accounting Principles Board “Opinions” are a significant underpinning of the accounting profession. The profession has also recognized the need for clear, concise writing. This study analyzes the twenty-four APB Opin ions that contain an “Opinion” section. The Farr-Jenkins-Paterson New Reading Ease Index indicated that three opinions were “difficult”; nine teen, “very difficult”; and two could not be categorized. Cloze scores indicated that accounting majors fared no better than the general popula tion for all the opinions, which may reflect the lack of necessary context for understanding. © 1977, Sage Publications.

Content analysis can expose hidden connections among concepts, reveal relationships among ideas that initially seem unconnected, and inform the decision-making processes associated with many technical communication practices. In this article, we explain the basics of content analysis methodology and dispel common misconceptions, report on a content analysis case study, reveal the most important objectives associated with conducting high quality content analyses, and summarize the implications of content analysis as a tool for technical communicators and researchers.""The authors report on a multiyear study designed to reveal how introducing a content management system (CMS) in an administrative office at a large organization affects the office's writing and work practices. Their study found that users implemented the CMS in new and creative ways that the designers did not anticipate and that the choices users made in using the CMS were often driven not by technology but by the social implications the CMS held for their office. By contrasting how writers negotiated specific genres of writing before and after the CMS was introduced, the authors argue for increased attention to providing flexible technologies that enable writers to innovate new tools in response to the social needs of their writing environments. This approach must be driven by research on the implications of technology in workplace communities. © The Author(s) 2011.""Scholars of rhetoric and writing have long recognized the mediated nature of rhetorical action. From Plato's early indictments of writing as enemy of memoria to Burke's recognition of instrumental causes to recent analyses of digital mediation, the study of meaning-making refuses one-to-one, transparent theories of communication, instead recognizing that there is more to rhetorical action than humans. This article follows the trail of Haas, Swarts, and others arguing that analyses of mediation uncover much about human motives, digital communities, and rhetorical action. I argue that technologies often function as rhetorical genres, providing what Miller characterizes as ""typified rhetorical actions based in recurrent situations"" that occur in uniquely digital spaces. Working from sites of participatory archival creation and curation, I argue that invisible rhetorical genres operating at macroscopic levels of scale are central to shaping individual and communal activity in sites of distributed social production. To support this claim, I investigate two applications - a content management system called Gazelle and a bittorrent tracker called Ocelot - to demonstrate how largely invisible server-side software shapes rhetorical action, circumscribes individual agency, and cultivates community identity in sites of participatory archival curation. By articulating content management systems and other macroscopic software as rhetorical genres, I hope to extend nascent investigations into the medial capacities of digital tools that shape our collective digital experience. © The Author(s) 2015.""This study examined 229 responses from members of the Association for Business Communication (United States) who rated the importance of 30 business communication concepts. The concepts were divided into six categories: communication theory, written communication, oral communication, employment communication, technology, and current business communication issues. Respondents also reported the amount of class coverage they provided for each topic. Of the 30 concepts, 23 were rated as moderately or greatly important. Gaps occurred in some categories between their perceived importance and their actual class coverage. The five most important concepts centered on written communication and were ranked as follows (from highest to lowest): Use correct grammar and sentence structure, write memoranda, write persuasive news, write good news/positive message letters, and write reports."Identifies and discusses the effects of single sourcing on the writing process Provides suggestions for incorporating the teaching of single sourcing into technical communication courses"The inclusion of a course in gender issues in a technical communication curriculum affords students the opportunity to confront objectivist and rationalist paradigms still found in the discourse of technical communication. This paper discusses the theoretical and practical foundations of a course which examines feminist inquiry into the production and dissemination of knowledge, as well as the language practices associated with professional writing and communication. Issues of gender roles within organizational collaborative work groups, as well as issues related to gendered assumptions in science and technology, are also integral parts of the course design.

South Korean texts showed more similarities to than differences from the American texts, and the language features found suggest a more complex context situation than the high/low context model may be able to accommodate.""To teach students how to write for the workplace and other professional contexts, technical writing teachers often assign writing tasks that reflect real-life communication contexts, a teaching approach that is grounded in the field's contextualized understanding of genre. This article argues to fully embrace contextualized literacy and better teach workplace writing, technical writing teachers also need to contextualize how they assess student writing. To this end, this article examines some of workplaces' best assessment practices and critically integrates them into an introductory technical writing classroom through a method called student-centered assessment instruments. This method engages students, as workplaces engage employees, in the assessment process to identify local requirements for writing tasks. Aligned with theory and practice, this method is not only an effective classroom assessment method, but becomes an integrated part of students' genre-learning process within and beyond the classroom.""This article uses both actor network theory (ANT) and activity theory to trace and analyze the ways in which both Twitter and third-party applications support the development and maintenance of meaningful contexts for Twitter participants.

However, contingent faculty lack professional development opportunities. In this article, the author reports survey results (N = 91) and three cases studies that provide information on contingent faculty and their preparation for online teaching and then provides a three-step approach for TPC program administrators and faculty to follow so that programs can create sustainable professional development opportunities for contingent faculty to teach online. © 2017, Routledge.

Using video tape as the teaching media and supplementing this with textbooks, especially developed studying guide materials, visual aids designed for TV presentations, and an associate instructor at the plant location to act in a resource capacity, a successful engineering personnel educational program has been developed economically that can be used at any plant location. Other industries could utilize the techniques described to bring high quality engineering-updating programs to the majority of their engineers, as could universiteis, to take graduate-level programs to locations distant from the campus at a time convenient to the engineers involved.""Describes contractor and consultant from a perceptual perspective Compares the implications of each; expected skills, knowledge, and value; and potential compensation""This report describes a heuristic used to start students of technical writing thinking about possible ways to represent information in a text. The heuristic has as its conceptual ground the ″control structures″ of recent computer programming theory and practice. These structures, SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and DO-WHILE, are described. It is shown how: they can be used in the classroom; in conferences with students; to generate questions about the text-subject; and ways information about it may be structured in the final written text.""Controlled English is a simplified form of English that uses a restricted vocabulary and a limited number of verb forms. Each word has one meaning, and synonyms are avoided. Sentences are kept as short, positive, and direct as possible. Non-English-speaking readers can be rapidly taught to understand controlled-English texts. They are not required to speak or write controlled English. An international company can produce just one controlled-English version of its technical documents for distribution worldwide, thus avoiding the need to translate into the languages of all its customers.""Editors, authors and managers often have trouble in defining the tasks and estimating and monitoring the costs associated with processing technical manuscripts preparatory to publication. In this article the author analyzes the editorial process into nine types of activity and then combines them cumulatively into five levels of edit, which can be used to specify the precise amount of editorial effort to be devoted to each publication.""In response to Arn Tibbett's call for papers related to the writing process in the Association for Business Communication Bulletin, the author asks if the credibility process of the discipline of business communication is also under scrutiny. The author asks readers to consider carefully the responses to Tibbett's call, noting that business writing processes in a global community will elicit diverse methodologies. The author calls for sensitivity to multicultural concepts of business communication, noting that it might open up other areas of academic debate.""The article presents a speech by Priscilla S. Rogers, 2000 recipient of the Association for Business Communication's (ABC) Outstanding Researcher Lecture. The speech focused on convergenceand commonality challenges for business communication researchers. Rogers explained that convergence and commonality are ideas which deem to prompt the members of ABC to stop seeking uniformity in methods and to use their diversity in their research.""The purpose of this article is to illustrate how processes of translation, technical communication, and design converge in the development and dissemination of multilingual content at a non-profit organization in the US. Method: As part of a larger project, the researchers observed and recorded (throughvideo footage and field notes) translation activities taking place in a Language Services office during the course of two years. To visualize translation activities, the researchers used screencast recordings that captured how translators coordinated digital resources (e.g., digital translation tools, online dictionaries) to successfully translate information. Finally, the researchers conducted 12 artifact-based interviews withtranslators at the researchsite. Results: Results show that translation, technical communication, and design activities are enacted iteratively and recursively by participants at this researchsite. Translators at this site must work across diverse design processes (UX design, information design, visual and document design) that often get subsumed into the translation process. Althoughemployees within this organization do not consider themselves designers or technical communicators, the work that takes place within this office requires expertise across these areas of study and practice. Conclusion: Designing and creating multilingual content often requires the intellectual contributions of individuals who can move across translation, technical communication, and design activities simultaneously. As the field of technical communication (particularly in the US) continues to acknowledge the value of global, multilingual content, it’s important that we highlight the expertise and added value of the multilingual communicators who make this work possible and accessible to users across cultures and languages. ©2017.

Similarly, we too often fragment our teaching to focus on particular communication processes and competencies that fit our notions of what is appro priate for our chosen subdisciplines. Such fragmentation, however, diminishes our teaching and research. To overcome this problem, we should work toward struc tural realignments in our universities to encourage cross-disciplinary work; design majors around competencies, not departments; encourage coteaching to focus dif ferent perspectives on one case or example; encourage interdepartmental “commu nication dialogues” read a broad range of literature and work toward expertise in a topic, not just a discipline; attend other than just the usual conferences; and invite students to use a wide range of resources in solving problems. © 2002, Sage Publications.

However, despite this observation, few fine-grained analyses have been carried out into the in situ communicative strategies deployed by practitioners to deal with the face-threatening nature of AIs. Using conversation analysis as a research methodology and transcripts of naturally occurring talk from an AI, this article explicates the seen but unnoticed machinery of talk by which facework during AIs is accomplished. Furthermore, it is argued that such fine-grained analysis of what actually goes on in AIs can add to our stocks of interactional knowledge concerning AIs which, as they stand, are more often based on second-order accounts rather than on direct observation of AIs as communicative events. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""The European Association of Editors of Biological Periodicals (ELSE), was founded to promote and assist in raising the quality of journals in Europe. Besides dealing with specific problems of writing in English by scientists for whom English is a foreign language, ELSE is concerned with primary-secondary journal relationships, with the smoother integration of journals from smaller non-English speaking countries into the international information system, and with overcoming the time lag due to technical and psychological reasons. Cooperation in the way of seeking uniformity while preserving individual character, providing redactory services, identifying referees, standardizing, and developing new systems of information transfer is discussed.""The National Standard Reference Data System consists of data centers and other projects funded or coordinated by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) which compile and evaluate data on physical and chemical properties of well-defined mateials. The output is then published in the form of tables of recommended data and critical reviews. In 1972 an agreement was reached with the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP) for establishing a new publication channel for the material, the Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data. The progress of this journal is reviewed.""Adapting the ethics of philosopher Henri Bergson, this article offers a theory to explain the volatile legal-ethical environment in which codes of conduct operate and proposes that technical communicators adopt this theory to build dialogic codes of conduct. Method: The article explicates and illustrates Bergson's theory of social and dynamic moralities (i.e., ethics as regulation of cooperative individuals and ethics as inspiration by heroic individuals) and offers a critical reading of three corporate codes of conduct from the perspective of this theory, emphasizing five factors: language emphasizing cooperation versus compliance, identification of authorship, clarity of ethical versus legal obligations, inclusion of humanizing pictorial images, and coverage of heroic individuals. Results: None of the corporate codes of conduct examined truly exploit the immense rhetorical power of narrative or illustrations. None exclusively emphasize cooperation or entirely specify authorship. None are altogether lucid or consistent in separating legal and ethical issues. Existing practices yield a missed opportunity to inspire as well as stipulate ethical behavior. Conclusion: Technical communicators are skilled in rhetoric, studied in ethics, and experienced in writing policies and instructions and in soliciting information from sources of knowledge and power. Technical communicators could thus be uniquely qualified to develop dialogic codes of conduct for corporations, industries, and professions.""Cultural shifts in technology and organizational structure are affecting the embodied practice of symbolic-analytic work, creating the need for more fine-grained tracings of everyday activity. Drawing on interviews and observations, this article explores how one freelance professional communicator's social media use is intertwined with inventive social coordination. Networked writing environments help symbolic analysts gain access to communities of practice, maintain a presence within them, and leverage social norms to circulate texts through them. © 2014 Copyright Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Basic editing rules are to preserve the author's voice, to edit only that which cannot possibly alter meaning, and to query generously. Alterations are controlled by letting authors see edited manuscripts before typesetting. Publication lag permits mailing time. Mailings have brought about author acceptance of copy improvements and the production office's understanding of authors' requirements. Because of variations among journals, editors, authors, printers, and type specifications, copy editors are responsible for journals from manuscript to approving for press.""This article describes “copyedit” grading in a technical writing course, contrasting it to the less thorough forms of grading found in many other writing courses. Copyedit grading uses detailed comments on and tight editing of student technical writing to show students how to write clearly and concisely. Grading in other writing courses, on the other hand, may be superficial and offer few suggestions for improving student writing. Student reactions to their first encounter with copyedit grading are described, along with the effects of this form of grading on the students and their work. © 1988 IEEE""Procedures used in grading technical writing assignments differ among technical communication instructors. The article documents the author's grading strategy in an upper-division technical writing course. Students taking the course plan technical communication careers. They complete 50 pages of editing exercises and generate more than 75 pages of double-spaced copy for eight assignments. The author responds to students' work in several ways: (1) personalized memos and extended handwritten comments, (2) marginal handwritten comments and questions, (3) internal copyediting of student manuscripts, (4) individual conferences, and (5) assignment of a grade. When editing student assignments, the author critiques content, communication effectiveness, and appearance. For content, the author evaluates the accuracy, consistency, logic, and evidence. For communication effectiveness, the author evaluates the appropriateness of the narrative and visuals for the audience, organization, clarity, and conciseness. For appearance, the author checks for spelling, mechanics, stylebook, and format errors. © 1988 IEEE""Much photocopying from journals and other works is outside the exemption provisions of the Copyright Law of 1976 and cannot legally be undertaken without payment to the copyright holder. Among proposed mechanisms for the determination or transfer of copy fees are subscription surcharges, establishment of statistical copying norms, licensing by publishers, and a transfer-of-payments center. This latter approach is recommended by the Association of American Publishers which has developed a program for the establishment of a not-for-profit organization through which users, including libraries and information services, may pay centrally for their journal-article copying.""Scientists seldom receive royalties for the publication of their scientific results (except in textbooks), and much research and publication is supported directly or indirectly by government funds. Nevertheless, xerographic reproduction of scientific papers in copyrighted journals is often restricted by publishers. In effect, copyright protection is seen as publisher rather than author protection. The problem is intertwined with economic considerations, but one partial solution might be to require government-grant recipients to use freely copyable journals when publishing their results. This paper, written about two years before enactment of the Copyright Law of 1976, does not reflect on the content of that Law, but rather serves to highlight some of the motivation for change.""This program has been developed to help users to obtain copies of the journal articles and other short works needed to supplement their subscriptions but which are not available to them under fair-use and related copyright provisions. It has also been designed to help promote vital journal-publishing continuity. While the initial system places emphasis on articles in TSM (technical-scientific-medical) journals, because of the strength of demands in this area and the orientation of those involved in planning this program, efforts are already underway to expand the program to other short documents.""This article reports on 12 select findings from a sequential mixed-methods, empirical study of U.S. educational-context professional writers composing for the Web. The study explores the status of knowledge and understanding of U.S. copyright law, levels of chilled speech, and the use of rhetorical invention in such digital writing contexts. Method: Research methods include a digital survey receiving 334 responses from randomly selected students/teachers and discourse-based interviews with seven of these participants. Results: With respect to authorship, Web writers sometimes occupy conflicting positions. Empirical evidence challenges traditional ideas of authorship, i.e., a single author working alone in a garret, producing texts from his or her sole creative genius. The study finds digital writers' speech is not as ""chilled"" as one might expect, and while knowledge of copyright law is important to digital writers, they are fairly confident in the knowledge they have. Copyright law is not the primary concern of digital writers. As it turns out, ethics trumps the law in importance when considering digital composing choices. In the area of copyright knowledge, key misunderstandings appeared among writers. For example: confusion on (1) the difference between copyright and plagiarism, (2) unauthorized use and authorized use, (3) the government exception to copyright, and (4) the fact that U.S. copyright law protects ""creative"" work to a higher extent than it protects ""factual"" work. Conclusion: The study hopes to provide a methodology for further research, and a baseline in the area of knowledge and understanding of copyright law as it intersects with invention, among the professional writing population.""A new copyright law (Public Law 94-553) became effective on January 1, 1978. In one way or another, the law affects all who write for publication. This article summarizes highlights of the law. Although the law also includes protection of music and broadcasting, these aspects are not discussed here. 14""This article explains the Constitution's intellectual property provision and its goals, then deconstructs the Supreme Court's decision in Eldred v. Ashcroft as a means to unravel the pieces in the complex relationship among the constitutional provision, the First Amendment, and copyright. The article then considers how an understanding of the relationship of these elements can be helpful for considering the positions of technical communicators as both users and producers of intellectual products. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""The copyright reform bill should become law in January, 1978. Among its major revision are the extension of protection for life plus fifty years and the mitigation of penalties for either omission of notice or ″innocent infringement″ . For the first time the law specifically identifies ″fair use″ and certain other copying practices as user rights. The issues of integrity of text and the use of protected text within computer systems have not been treated. The law's text itself remains general in the hope that it will prove to be a flexible vehicle for the future. An era of informal agreements and litigation between publishers and users can be anticipated. Scientific and technical publishing must be recognized as a special area within the publishing community on the verge of change.""The concept of copyright has greatly changed through the years, both in importance and definition. The conflict of personal right of ownership versus the public welfare has grown increasingly complex in recent times. A familiarity with the historical perspective is necessary to understand these developments. Even today, the Copyright Revision Bill lies before Congress and long-awaited decisions will be made to shape events in the immediate future. These decisions will affect the student and the professional alike by their effect on the availability of materials to everyone. The ease and availability of present-day photocopying necessarily will affect the nature of the decisions. This paper gives an overview of the historical background, the status of present law, and the possible future role of the copyright.""Earlier studies have shown that in a given scientific subject, a relatively few primary journals contain a substantial proportion of journal literature, and the rest of the literature is scattered throughout a large number of journals only peripherally related to the subject. In this paper, an attempt has been made to identify the ″core″ primary journals in the newly emerging discipline of computer science. Two measures of significance have been used to draw up a core list of journals: Productivity, in terms of the number of source items drawn from each journal for review in a secondary journal (Computing Reviews); and extent of use, as reflected by the frequency with which the journals are cited in a leading primary journal (IEEE Transactions on Computers) over a period of two years. This study has shown that the primary journal is the most favored medium for scholarly communication, and that computer science journal literature has consolidated into a relatively few very productive and highly cited primary journals.""This article advocates student learning portfolios as an effective assessment technique and explains how instructors and administrators can devise a process that involves community partners in assessing student performance. Having community experts judge a student portfolio contest helps faculty identify standards for success that can inform decision making about course content and program offerings.

Notebook sized computers, easy-to-use software, access to information both private or public, and electronic mail capabilities available worldwide have made telecommuting possible. This paper examines some of the key factors involved in the telecommuting evolution. Coverage includes background on how telecommuting started and which current technologies lend themselves to telecommuting. Also, the article reviews the trends that are stimulating dramatic double-digit growth and describes corporate attitudes toward and experiences with telecommuting. Topics covered include corporate commitments, motivation, productivity, supervision, and employee satisfaction. © 1995 IEEE.""The federal securities laws extensively regulate disclosure by publicly traded companies. Overregulation has sometimes hindered management's ability to develop effective and timely communications.

It finds that the engineers most often used these strategies intuitively and that their use of the strategies was influenced by values considered important in their organization's culture. This suggests that communicaters can intentionally choose among an array of audience analysis strategies, and the choices of analysis strategy, information to include/exclude, and style are influenced by the organizational culture in which the communicater works. This further suggests that professionals can analyze their intended audiences to determine whether the audience is likely to share the organization's assumptions and values upon which a communication is based. © 1995 IEEE.""Warner-Lambert adopted its first formal Creed statement in March 1985 after more than 2 years of discussion and soul-searching among its managerial personnel. The mission document is deeply rooted in the company's 99-year history of acquisitions and mergers but also reflects a recent major restructuring that set the company on a new course. The Creed is in keeping with the corporate culture that developed over the years; it also was designed as a road map to help Warner-Lambert become the kind of company it says it wants to be. New Creed-oriented action programs, aided by gap analysis, have sprung up in the 3 ensuing years and the “culture fever” shows no signs of abating. © 1989 IEEE""The response to a consumer grievance is an important element of the total communi cation process because it is the firm's feedback to its customer.

Liability issues have become a prime concern in four areas where language plays a major part: 1) investment information, 2) goods and services marketing, 3) safety information, and 4) employee handbooks. Understanding the legal problems attendant to these areas will allow corporate writers to better avoid language that risks litigation. © 1990 IEEE""The paper examines how the tensions of corporate responsibility are articulated and reconciled in a controversial situation of a foreign investment. We conducted a conventionalist analysis on the company press releases in a case where a Finnish forest industry company invested in a pulp mill in South America. The findings show that the use of language in press releases mobilizes certain stakeholders while reassuring others, and that the argumentation used creates value-neutral communication, making it possible to pursue strategic goals despite competing values. For teaching, we provide insights on how to communicate in a conflict situation. © 2011 Association for Business Communication.""This study examines whether companies report risk-relevant information to prospective investors. While corporate risk communication is important for the well-functioning of capital markets, our current understanding of risk reporting practices is limited. The sample consists of Dutch companies raising capital on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in the late 1990s. In this setting, companies had much discretion in writing the risk section of the prospectus. After a detailed content analysis of the risk sections, the author demonstrates that a measure of risk extracted from these texts successfully predicts the volatility of companies' future stock prices, the sensitivity of future stock prices to market-wide fluctuations, as well as severe declines in future stock prices. Overall, these results support the view that prospectuses of Dutch companies provide adequate information about material investment risks. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""In this article, the authors compare the corporate social responsibility reporting (CSRR) of companies- environment, human relations, community, human rights, and diversity dimensions-in the emerging market economy of South Africa with that of companies in the leading economies represented by the Fortune Global 100. The descriptive analysis extends earlier empirical work on the CSRR of emerging market economies, and the impact of culture on CSRR, by examining annual report data from the top 100 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Index and the Fortune Global 100. Generally, the frequency and level of CSRR in South African companies was significantly higher than that of the Fortune Global 100, which indicates a greater willingness to convey social responsibility in their disclosure practices. This lends credence to the notion that emerging market economies may be more receptive to stakeholder concerns and social responsibility than peer institutions in leading economies. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Web-based training has been both acclaimed as a self-paced, consistent, stand-alone alternative to traditional instructor-led training and disparaged for its high development costs and dearth of qualified trainers. Critics especially question its effectiveness. This case study tests the effectiveness of a stand-alone web-based training program and compares the results to that of an identical instructor-led course. The course provides highly task-oriented instruction for a computer software package and was developed using a proven instructional design methodology. The data from this study show that web-based training is as effective as instructor-led training for stand-alone software application training in a corporation.""For years, students, faculty, and, most important, employers, have recognized the need for improved communication skills. The university business communication curriculum is filled with topics that lead to improving communication skills. A percentage of students find some topics to be boring, unimportant, intimidating, and/or nonessential. However, other students find these same topics to be interesting, significant, challenging, and vital. For example, college students fear giving oral presentations more than writing papers. Could the preference or the abhorrence of various business communication topics be related to personality type? To answer this question, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), combined with a Likert Scale, was used to study the relationship between business communication students' personality types and their preferred topics in business communication.""Correspondence analysis is a statistical method that allows researchers to explore relationships among complex categorical variables. This paper will provide researchers with the theoretical and practical foundations for understanding and applying correspondence analysis to their own research agendas. Problem: Technical communicators use a variety of research methods and collect a variety of types of data. Of particular interest to technical communicators is categorical data, or data that are not traditionally quantitative. For instance, technical communicators often collect and analyze language data from a variety of texts. Analyzing this type of data can be difficult using traditional statistical methods. Key concepts: Variable types, a priori versus exploratory research designs, contingency tables, and data visualization are central to understanding the foundations of correspondence analysis. Key lessons: To conduct correspondence analysis, a researcher must walk through a series of steps including: (1) determining whether correspondence analysis is appropriate, (2) choosing a statistical software package, (3) running the correspondence analysis, and (4) interpreting and applying the results. Implications for practice: While correspondence analysis provides many useful insights into categorical data, a researcher must consider several things when deciding to use correspondence analysis. These include the potential to misinterpret and misapply the results of a correspondence analysis. © 2016 IEEE.""The effects of globalization on communication products and processes have resulted in document features and interactional practices that are sometimes difficult to describe within current theoretical frameworks of inter/transcultural technical communication. Although it has been recognized in our field that the old theoretical frameworks and assumptions are no longer adequate by themselves in the global workplace, to date no comprehensive theoretical framework has been suggested that is capable of encompassing hybrid characteristics of transcultural technical communication that emerge as a result of increased contact and connectivity. This article provides an interdisciplinary overview of Cosmopolitan theory and suggests that applying the cosmopolitan framework of Ulrich Beck to our research and the Dialogical Cosmopolitanism approach of Suresh Canagarajah to our pedagogical practices can move us towards a deeper understanding of global phenomena. ©2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""In this paper we argue that cultural diversity can be advantageous or detrimental for organizations depending on organization members' communication. We introduce three forms of communication explored by W Barnett Pearce, each of which differs in deeply held assumptions. The forms ultimately relate to different ways of being human. We consider the ways that two of the forms, ethnocentric and modernistic, can lead to problems in decision-making and creativity in diverse organizations. We then present cosmopolitan communication, discussing how the form can lead to positive outcomes in diverse organizations, why it works well, and how change agents can encourage communication that draws on this form. We overview the implications of cosmopolitan communication for organizational-level diversity changes and for learning organizations. Given the exploratory nature of the pairing between managing diversity and these three communication forms, extensive suggestions for future research are made. © 2003, Sage Publications.

Despite this unanimity of opinion, however, few recognize the important, complex factors that affect readers and writers’ perceptions of clarity. This article examines three of the most important such factors: precision, document accessibility, and corporate language context. Each factor is defined and examined in terms of its influence on clarity. The result is a better understanding of the multiple factors we need to consider before we pass judgment on a document's clarity. © 1992 IEEE""The author discusses a course developed for document managers, designed to balance the specificity of a company-based how-to course and the abstractness of a management theory course. The course was based on accounts of management practices in many organizations. It presented a variety of methods and concepts, and encouraged flexibility in thinking about document management. Topics included personnel management, long-term planning, project planning, and project direction and control.""This paper outlines the common failures of those in-service education programs which attempt to promote good writing among professionals through courses modeled on college composition curricula. It analyzes the practices of both the university and the extramural society in an attempt to define those elements which historically have promoted good writing and which, insofar as they have been de-emphasized today, have impeded good writing practices among professionals. Finally the distinct responsibilities of both the university of society at large are used to develop another model which may better encourage sound writing habits at all managerial levels.""Text, the product generated by technical writers, functions in continually evolving ways in the development of educational software, or 'courseware'. A team of courseware developers at Texas A&M University is designing a computer-assisted course in statics, as part of a computer-based undergraduate engineering curriculum being developed by a major corporation. On such a project, the technical writers' tasks include not only documentation and editing, but also reinterpretation of the role of the written word as it functions in the new context of computer-assisted-instruction (CAI). The technical writers share with the subject-matter experts in engineering the responsibilities of course development.""The cover letter to be sent with a resume to a prospective employer should be grammatically and typographically perfect. The principles to follow when composing the cover letter are the same as for any technical communication: Use simple, precise language; be concise; use the active voice. Tips on how to handle the mechanical aspects of the cover letter - selecting paper, using proper margins, and writing short paragraphs - are also presented.""This study examines the content of press releases from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Science and Technology Centers (STCs) to determine how public information officers (PIOs) presented the outcomes of centers to journalists and the public. A total of 68 press releases were analyzed for type of news covered, visibility of centers and their funding agency, extent of inter-institutional cooperation in the issuance of releases, and players covered. Three-quarters of STC releases mentioned the center, but less than half mentioned the NSF STC program and one-quarter didn't mention the center name at all. PIOs covering the STCs mainly issued researchoriented press releases accredited to their own institution. There was a low level of inter-institutional cooperation, with 13% of press releases jointly issued. Compared to research results and institutional news, which together accounted for 82% of the news events, broader activities such as knowledge transfer, diversity enhancement, and education were much less visible.""Research has noted an increase in the use of assessed group projects across disciplines in institutions of higher learning. Consequently, this study investigates the prompt for an assessed group case-study project in a sophomore business module in order to provide lecturers with tools and techniques for probing a prompt document. The authors use a task-analysis framework developed for task-based language teaching to examine the project's requirements and chain of integrated tasks. The study shows that the project prompt was dense and complicated and the component tasks were highly interactive and complex. Further, the study reveals that group case-study projects can play an important role in developing the team skills needed for future real-life projects. © The Author(s) 2012.""This article examines tutorials from the Web site, Instructables.com, to highlight the rhetorical possibilities of including personal narratives in instructions.

Using retrospective analysis and e-mail interviews, the author discusses his own previous experience as a technical editor at a U.S. Government-run research facility when electronic editing was introduced and used. The introduction of electronic editing, the author argues, was an example of technological innovation, which, as other researchers have demonstrated, can create authority within an organization.""Xerox Corporation has developed an integrated electronic documentation system for field technicians to use at customer sites for diagnosis and repair of equipment.

This article discusses how the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) was used, user interface requirements and how they are addressed in our system, multimedia implementation techniques, integration strategies with other service tools, and the technologies employed in the system.""This paper summarizes three field experiments involving distributed collaborative writing (CW) in traditional educational settings creating a hybrid form of distributed education. One finding shows that specialized collaborative tools allowed for parallel work, group awareness, and coordination, providing substantial advantages over traditional word processors in distributed CW. However, it was also found that advanced CW tools alone did not provide optimal results in distributed CW groups; such groups also needed high levels of process structure, which can be delivered through carefully constructed scripts. Moreover, it was found that introducing face-to-face meetings in distributed CW work did not necessarily provide advantages over work that was performed in all-distributed settings. Given these findings, this paper concludes by discussing the contributions, implications, limitations, and future research possibilities for hybrid-distributed education. © 2004 IEEE."Defines basic sales terms  Explores ways to use text and illustrations to create engineering marketing slides  Examines six methods of strengthening the persuasiveness of engineering marketing slides."With the advent of handy internet building tools, online surveys are becoming a promising alternative to traditional paper- and mail-based surveys to collect data for survey research. While conducting online surveys has its advantages, it comes with a unique set of challenges. Leveraging our experience in developing multiple online surveys, we highlight some of the critical issues of the process. This tutorial provides insights to develop and conduct online surveys effectively. In a step-by-step process, we offer recommendations to researchers at various decision stages of developing an online survey, from initial planning through the final data-collection phase. © 2009 IEEE.""Although most theorists agree that discourse creates meaning, they have not adequately described how this process emerges within the creation of procedural knowledge. This article explores how technical communicators in diverse settings based discourse decisions on their knowledge of (a) users, (b) organizational image and constraints, (c) software structure and features, and (d) genre conventions in order to create communication artifacts designed to help users develop procedural knowledge. The transformations in which they engaged indicated that these technical communicators were skilled in forming images in these four areas and then using these images as they created meaning in procedural discourse. In this process, they moved beyond merely translating or transmitting technical knowledge. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""This article highlights the creation of professional electronic portfolios (eportfolios) in an upper-division technical writing course (Writing for Interactive Media) so that students can profile their work.

It explores existing literature and suggests new ideas about creativity and CM. Research questions: How can we conceptualize creativity in relation to CM? How can creativity be operationalized into specific design practices within CM? What dimensions of creativity should be considered when designing or evaluating creative CM systems? Situating the case: Theoretical research in content-management systems (CMSs) and LMSs has revealed a gap in our field's current understanding of how creativity relates to CM. Research studies related to the measurement of creativity have provided insight into characteristics and methodologies that could be adopted and adapted to evaluate creativity in CM. Studies from the learning sciences have investigated where LMSs fall short and suggested where new opportunities exist to better facilitate the informational needs of users. These works have pointed to a need for research on integrating creativity and CM, both in content and in the systems that manage content, and have laid the groundwork for this study. Methodology: This research investigates theories of creativity as they relate to CM by conducting a case study analysis of unique instructional software designed to deliver content to students enrolled in a university course. The primary evidence is taken from notes about the design and evaluation of the software and from survey data illustrating students' user experiences. About the case: We developed a classification strategy for exploring creativity along three dimensions-importance, novelty, and affect-And then used this strategy to explore a unique system's approach to deal with content challenges in each of those areas. User experience impressions provide evidence of successes and failures of experimental CM in these domains. Conclusions: The study finds that this original LMS design did contain features that exhibited novelty, importance, and affect, and that such features can be used to identify creativity in product design as well as to assess the design of complex software systems such as CMSs and LMSs. This detailed analysis of an original design for an LMS suggests new ideas for implementing and using CMSs and LMSs in technical communication. The study concludes by presenting a rubric for evaluating creativity in CMSs and LMSs, or for designing such systems with creativity in mind. © 2017 IEEE.""A rational and popular viewpoint is that the function of scientific writing is to communicate knowledge. A study of prominent journals, however, suggests that clear communication is not appreciated within the reading-writing-refereeing community. If clarity is a goal for a journal, the editor must take action.""The process of revising a technical or scientific paper can be performed more efficiently by the people involved (author, co-author, supervisor, editor) when the revision is controlled by breaking it into a series of steps. The revision process recommended here is based on the levels-of-edit concept that resulted from a study of the technical editorial function at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. Types of revision discussed are Substantive, Policy, Language, Mechanical Style, Format, Itegrity, and Copy Clarification.""Technical communication programs preparing students to perform as symbolic analytic workers can improve a student's creative problem-solving abilities by offering study-abroad opportunities.

That is, they must be such that they change the knowledge or understanding of the readers, or else they demand appropriate action. These introductory notes explain under what circumstance statements need to be made more credible and they explain how to add credibility at the clause, sentence, paragraph, and section levels. Principles of syllogistic reasoning, analogies, and experimental reasoning are also discussed.

I developed the case described in this article to give students a real world look at how corporations communicate in a crisis-in this case, a crisis of extraordinary proportions. The foundation for the case is the public communication from American Airlines and United Airlines via their press releases within the 24 hours following the first plane's crash into the World Trade Center. The activities provided allow students to produce appropriate corporate communication, in this case, press releases, using the details of the situation. They also provide a variety of ways to use crisis-response strategies, such as Coombs', to analyze, critique, compare, and contrast how each airline constructed the messages it conveyed on this fateful day. This case study demonstrates how crucial each word of a message can be and allows students to reach concrete decisions about why a crisis-response plan, along with the accompanying crisis-response strategies and the resulting communication products, are essential for any corporation. © 2004 IEEE.""This article reports results of a qualitative study that examined communication challenges decision makers experience during the response stage of crisis management. Response is perhaps the most critical of the three stages (prevention, response, recovery) identified in crisis research literature. Response is the point when crisis managers make decisions that may save lives and mitigate the effects of the crisis. Actions at this point also significantly influence public opinion about the crisis and an organization's handling of the event. This study provides additional insight into the complexities of the response stage through analysis of 26 interviews conducted with crisis decision makers involved in 15 organizational crises. Ten additional crises were analyzed through secondary data sources. The result of these analyses is the identification and explication of four crisis response steps: observation, interpretation, choice, and dissemination. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication."The behavior of a fluidized bed reactor for a nonisothermal first-order reaction has been represented in a compact form involving two groups of parameters.

This study explores corporate websites from a different view - that of the company - and investigates the organizational motivation to adopt new interactive features on corporate websites. Research question: What are the critical factors influencing the firm's adoption of online innovations related to interactivity on their websites? Literature review: Many dominant theories in information technology (IT) that guide most research on IT adoption at the firm level include the diffusion of innovations theory (which seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread through cultures) and the technology, organization, and environment framework (which identifies three aspects of an enterprise's context that influence the process by which it adopts and implements a technological innovation). But other research streams can contribute to the Theory of Technology Adoption at the firm level, including Institutional Theory (which is a widely accepted theoretical posture that emphasizes rational myths, isomorphism, and legitimacy) and the model of Iacovou ${\rm {et al.}}$(which analyzes interorganizational systems' characteristics that influence firms to adopt IT innovations). Methodology: A conceptual model with supporting propositions was tested using an online questionnaire. Data were collected from 138 firms in Switzerland and Germany and analyzed with multiple regression analysis. Results and conclusions: Complexity, perceived benefits, top management support, and information intensity are the drivers that play important roles in the diffusion of innovation related to interactivity on corporate websites, and support our conceptual model. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Most of the previous research into corporate websites has focused on the users' point of view and their perception of usability and interactivity as the two predominant website characteristics, and has shown that interactivity plays an important role in consumers' perceptions of, and responses to, these sites.

The first is the transformation of organic human genetic material into computationally sophisticated data, and the second is the subsequent conversion of these vast quantities of genetic data into intellectual property through gene patenting and screening-test marketing. This article examines these representational changes in medical subjects through an intertextual and rhetorical analysis of the documentation surrounding the discovery, patenting, and marketing of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 by the biotechnology company Myriad Genetics. It identifies the impact of these changes on the analysis of the risks and benefits associated with screening for heritable diseases. © 2005 Sage Publications.""This paper examines twenty-two experimental usability studies that appeared between 1980 and 1989. The discussion takes two directions: 1) analysis of fundamental aspects of research coherence and unity by assessing the extent to which researchers jointly pursue a logical sequence of questions and the extent to which they integrate findings from prior studies into their own designs; and 2) assessment of how trends in sample selection, size, and composition limit the strength of research conclusions. Ten years’ worth of choices about samples show that a cumulative laxity in these choices has greatly constrained what we confidently can say experimental studies have proven about effective hard copy documentation. The paper concludes by offering thirteen recommended design strategies for future usability research. © 1991 IEEE""In the discipline of design, the most common presentation genre is the critique, and the most central aspect of this genre is the feedback. Using a qualitative framework, this article identifies a typology of feedback, compares the frequencies of feedback types between different levels of design studios ranging from novice to expert, and explores what the feedback reflects about the social and educational context of these design studios. Results suggest that the feedback socialized students into egalitarian relationships and autonomous decision-making identities that were perhaps more reflective of academic developmental stages or idealized workplace contexts than of actual professional settings-therefore potentially complicating the preprofessional goals of the critique. © 2008 Sage Publications.""This paper is a critique of current approaches to the development of computer graphing and graph visualization programs. Developers of these programs model the user as an individual problem solver who is reliant on perceptual skills to create and interpret graphed information. Such a model of graphing is ill-suited to meet the complex needs of real users, a supposition that is supported by work in two major areas of graphing theory and research: the sociology of science and the educational research of mathematics and scientific students. These areas have not been traditionally cited when planning computer graphing or visualization programs or when assessing their usability. A review of the literature in these fields reveals that an over-reliance on a user's perceptual skills is unlikely to result in successful graph practices.""Cross-cultural blunders caused by inappropriate use of language are a common problem in international professional communication. They cause misunderstanding, lead to business failures, and tend to be offensive at times. Such blunders may occur in business ads, slogans, products names, and instructions. Understanding their causes and finding solutions to them are of importance in international professional communication. By examining specific cases, the article analyzes the causes that lead to such blunders from a semantic perspective and concludes that indiscriminate use of the semantic meaning of a word, a lexical form, lexical sound, numbers, color words, and animal names of the target language is the major cause of causing cultural blunders in international professional communication. Along the way, the article also offers solutions to the problems identified.""This article reviews the scholarly literature in cross-cultural business communication and discusses the shortcomings of the existing research.

American students worked with a nursing home to plan a public relations event and the Russian students gave a party for children at an orphanage in Tomsk, Russia. Students worked in teams and accomplished assigned responsibilities. Both groups produced a public relations event and each contacted the press seeking news cover age. The Americans surveyed stakeholders about the effectiveness of the organiza tion's ability to communicate with its constituents.

Corporations must comply with federal guidelines on sexual harassment while fostering a productive work environment in the cross-gender workplace. Immediacy communicates approachability and availability. Interpersonal relationships are crucial to job effectiveness and satisfaction for technical communication professionals. Increased concern about sexual harassment in the workplace, however, creates a paradox: while immediacy behaviors can establish a positive workplace environment, sexual harassment policies can serve to inhibit such behaviors. As a result, technical communication professionals in the arenas of training policies and procedures construct training programs that provide both male and female perspectives and prevent the slanting of materials inappropriately in one direction over another. This paper addresses immediacy behaviors that are appropriate within the context of sexual harassment policies in the cross-gender workplace. Emphasis is placed upon the paradox created by immediacy, which establishes interpersonal warmth and closeness, and sexual harassment policies, which are designed to reduce employer liability. © 1992 IEEE""This article analyzes the benefits of experiential learning in cross-disciplinary global learning environments by recounting work in the Global Classroom Project, which electronically links students and professors from Russia and America.

In doing so, students prepare for a future in which synthetic thinking that leads to innovative, imaginative problem solving and invention will be desirable and necessary. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""Localization includes translating, explaining, and adapting a document for use in a specific culture. This article presents the case of a form for reporting the findings and decisions of pre-production meetings held during development of electronic products. The need to localize such a document may seem less obvious or critical than the need for sales documents like manuals, but this case demonstrates the same cultural requirements and, furthermore, the requirements of corporate differences. To meet local needs, the comprehensive preparation that localization requires should follow specific methods in each step of a process corresponding to the general writing process, like the stages defined in common technical writing texts. The deliberate use of an effective writing process to localize documents will improve results.""When Chiquita Brands considered relocating its corporate headquarters, competing cities started Twitter campaigns to influence the decision by communicating directly with the chief executive officer. As he used the new microblogging channel, some of his previously private communication became public, some personal communication became professional, and some professional communication became personal. The case shows how social media can significantly affect chief executive officers' communication by encouraging boundary crossing. Understanding the connections between the private versus public and personal versus professional rhetorical categories will help business communicators make wise choices as technology continues to introduce new social media and other channel options. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""Technical communication practitioners and scholars need to pushthe boundaries of user experience scholarship to develop more culturally sensitive design and researchmethods that address global digital divides. In this spirit, I examined the local ways in whichcommunity technology center (CTC) tutors helped teachinexperienced users how to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) during basiCcomputer courses. Method: I collected data throughethnographiCmethods including participantobservation, qualitative interviews, and extant documents. Using grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1990), I developed open codes and constantly compared codes to develop categories and properties. Results: Inexperienced ICT users are unable to utilize online and other resources because they often lack the necessary physical experience working withICTs and the cultural knowledge to operate them. CTCtutors serve as local technical communication experts who construct effective methods for helping learners by: 1) utilizing visual representations, 2) utilizing audible representations, and 3) heightening learner awareness for visual cues. Conclusion: Inexperienced users struggle withusing ICT hardware and software. An on-the-ground approachto studying usability in the field makes user experience researchbothmore inclusive and comprehensive. Suchinsight froMinexperienced users sheds light on how digital inequalities persist and how practitioners and scholars can work to ensure inexperienced users are not forgotten in UX research. © 2017.

But the concept of sharing ideas requires technical speakers to make two crucial decisions before preparing their pattern of organization. First, they must decide just what purpose they are trying to accomplish by speaking. Second, they must consider how knowledgeable their audience is. After these decisions have been made the subject of the speech will have to be explained and limited considering both audience and time.

Some professors of technical communication create disrespect for themselves and their specialities because they create degrading representations of working people and their artifacts, they promote impossible standards, and they advance discredited or misleading theories. More profitable approaches to gaining prestige for academic technical communication include recognizing that not everyone can be the top person in the positional economy, studying works on the economics of prestige, and promoting the genuinely good works that already exist in academic technical communication.""Written clarity and conciseness are desired by employers and emphasized in business communication courses. We developed and tested the efficacy of a cueing tool— Scribe Bene—to help students reduce their use of imprecise and ambiguous words and wordy phrases. Effectiveness was measured by comparing cue word usage between a treatment group given the tool and a control group without the tool. In written assignments, the treatment group used 16 of 23 cue words significantly less than the control group and this effect persisted over time. Implications for using automated cueing tools in teaching written communication skills are discussed. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""Gaining access to interdisciplinary research sites poses unique research challenges to technical and professional communication scholars and practitioners. Drawing on applied experiences in externally funded interdisciplinary research projects and scholarship about interdisciplinary research, this article describes a training protocol for preparing graduate students to understand the dynamic nature of access in interdisciplinary work as well as to develop a capacity for making a case about the value of their expertise in interdisciplinary research contexts. The authors situate the training protocol in the context of three distinct phases of case-making (individual, relational, and speculative) and note how the conditions for negotiating access vary within and across these phases. The authors conclude by describing implications to graduate students and faculty for theorizing access in this way and developing training to support graduate students' negotiation of access in interdisciplinary work. © The Author(s) 2017.""Critical thinking is an essential component of managerial literacy, yet business school graduates struggle to apply critical-thinking skills at work to the level that employers desire. This article argues for a dispositional approach to teaching critical thinking, rooted in cultivating a critical-thinking culture. We suggest a two-pronged approach of (a) clearly defining critical thinking and selecting an accessible model for applying it and (b) integrating critical thinking consistently throughout the business curriculum. We illustrate implementation of this strategy in our revised MBA curriculum and conclude by challenging others to consider adopting a cultural and dispositional approach. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""Approaches to using visual language in a cultural context can be placed on a continuum, with global (universal) on one end and culture-focused on the other. Each approach reveals contrasting assumptions about three central design issues: perception, aesthetics, and pragmatics. The global approach is characterized by attempts to invent an objective, universal visual language or to define such a language through perceptual principles and empirical research. The culture-focused perspective is founded on the principle that visual communication is intimately bound to experience and hence can function only within a given cultural context, to which designers must be sensitive. While the modernist, universal approach has been losing ground to the postmodern, culture-focused approach, the two complement each other in a variety of ways and, depending on the rhetorical situation, offer pragmatic benefits and drawbacks. © 1995 IEEE.""Explores intercultural communication in one multinational organization in Quito, Ecuador  Finds communication of South Americans was usually oral, contextual, concrete, personal, and narrative; that of U.S. personnel was written, acontextual, universal, abstract, and analytical.""Imbedded within a larger culture of defense contracting and an organizational culture that rewarded the blurring of ethical boundaries, Sundstrand Corporation found itself in a crisis situation: facing federal charges of fraud, falling company stock prices, a lawsuit initiated by stockholders, and a serious threat of debarment.

The research reported in this article is a first attempt to systematically explore the effects cultural adaptations of user instructions have on users. Specifically, we investigate whether Western (from Europe and North America) and Chinese (from the People's Republic of China) users would benefit from a document structure that is theoretically assumed to reflect their cultural preferences. Method: Using the SDL Trados Studio 2014 translation software package, a 2x2 experiment (N=80) was conducted with manual structure (Western versus Chinese) and cultural background (Western versus Chinese) as independent variables. The Chinese and Western manual structures were based on the literature on cultural differences between Western and Chinese technical communication. Dependent variables were task performance, knowledge, and appreciation of the software and the user instructions. Results: Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were found between the conditions. Both Western and Chinese participants performed equally well and were equally appreciative when using the Western and Chinese manual structure. Conclusion: The results of our study raise questions about the validity and/or the relevance of the current insights regarding cultural differences in the structures of user instructions. Cultural differences found in content analytic research may reflect the habits of technical communicators rather than the preferences of users. However, caution is needed in interpreting our findings, as our research experiences also raised a number of methodological issues that must be addressed in future research. © 2015, (publisher).All rights reserved.""Reports on a study of 300 people in the Netherlands, France, and Senegal* Finds that the cultures differ with respect to the presentation introduction they prefer* Presents a model to predict the extent to which an introduction will be appreciated in a culture""The challenge posed by the increasing cultural diversity of the U.S. workforce is perhaps the most pressing challenge of our times. Scholarship on this increasing diversity has produced general overviews on diversity and related issues, essays that offer a theoretical perspective and suggest research directions for studying diversity in organizations, and few actual research studies of diversity in organizations. The research studies that have been done examine differences in organizational communication in different (particularly national) cultures, examine organizational communication in multicultural contexts, and explore cultural voices in the workplace. Researchers of cultural diversity in organizations must look to alternative theoretical perspectives, such as feminist theories, critical theories, and sociological paradigms to identify the problematics and methodologies appropriate to future diversity studies. This research needs to document different voices in the workforce, especially those that have been marginalized. Multicultural discourses that incorporate the diverse voices of all workers will not only transform our public and private economic organizations, they will also reinvigorate our public discourses and political institutions, strengthening our social, political, and economic well-being. There have been numerous challenges issued to academics to become more involved in the pressing social issues of the day and to demonstrate, in the public arena, the worth of their studies. The study of cultural diversity and of multicultural discourses in organizations offers an opportunity for scholars to do that. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""The importance of being fluent in a foreign language has been well docu mented and highlighted in academic texts. So has the importance of being fluent in another culture, a need documented as early as the 1950s. How have organizations in the UK and Ireland responded to these needs?A survey of members of ALECS (Association of Language Excellence Centres) in the UK and language training providers in Ireland assessed the level of language and cultural awareness. The results indicate that the percentage of British and Irish companies carrying out an internal foreign language audit is disturb ingly low. The number of companies wishing to become culturally fluent is even lower. Companies as well as training organizations are thus overlooking a number of opportunities. © 1997, Sage Publications.

While the popular press often associates success with a “strong” culture or specific cultural characteristics, it is likely that different industries place different demands upon companies, to which different cultural adjustments are appropriate. Examining different characteristics such as capital intensity, investment payback period, and nature of competition, this paper hypothesizes that industries vary in the degree to which they concentrate upon either reliability of product or service or adaptability to the market place as a primary objective. It is further hypothesized that firms at either extreme will develop very different cultures in order to meet their challenges. An examination of management survey data from utilities and high tech manufacturers supports the hypotheses. Utilities reflected values that assured wide involvement in decisions and protected the company against radical departures from established procedures. The manufacturers, on the other hand, reflected values which facilitated their ability to quickly respond to opportunities or changes in the marketplace. © 1990 IEEE""Budget and time constraints often force technical communicators to produce manuals that are less than affective. One reason is the time they take to analyze their document's users. Normally, user analysis involves demographic, or organizational, or psychological approaches or combinations. Rarely will they evaluate the culture of the user and determine what that means for developing the document. Typically, localization will edit the document for cultural elements, but that is an expensive and time-consuming process. This article discusses the cultural elements in developing a document and shows, through a comparison of two mythical cultures, how the document will differ when organized for those two cultures.""Foreign students, who spend four or more years studying at U.S. universities, often do not realize how much their years in America have changed them. Nor do they realize that these changes will have a profound effect upon them when they return to their native cultures. The difficulty they will have upon returning to their home countries has been called cultural reentry shock. It will, to a greater or lesser degree, affect all foreign students when they go home. The professional writing classroom seems a good place for educators to make foreign (and American) students aware of cultural reentry shock. Teachers can define the various problems associated with this phenomenon, lead students in discussion of the problems, and propose ways to ease the severity of the problems. Writing assignments may be structured in such a way as to allow students to do self-analysis of the changes they have undergone during their years in the U.S. And these students can be encouraged to design their technical documents using their native environments as the source of data, examples, and issues to write about. These documents can also be written for an audience in the native culture, rather than to an American audience. The professional writing class can be an effective forum for defining, discussing, and alleviating the trauma of cultural reentry shock. © 1992 IEEE"Development projects in information and communication technologies may fail if local users perceive them as incompatible with existing work practices or cultural values.

High-intensity language tends to be more colorful, subjective, emotionally charged and personal (e.g. ""plot"", ""scheme""), while low-intensity language tends to be more bland, objective, dispassionate and impersonal (e.g. ""plan""). High-intensity language can be good for the professional writer since color and emotion attract interest, but this can be a damaging sort of interest if readers are offended by the level of intensity. Low-intensity language, on the other hand, is safer because it is less personal and hence less likely to offend, yet too much of it may put the reader to sleep. Thus, the challenge for professional writers is to find a median intensity, a healthy balance between subjectivity and objectivity.""Members of ABCA and other experts in business communication may disagree with Weeks's assessment of “current issues” in this paper presented to our Japanese colleagues at the annual meeting of the Japan Business English Association in Tokyo, October 18, 1975. There were other matters which could have been discussed, had it not been for the limitations of time. Basic, however, to good business writing nationally and internationally is solving problems of the best psychological approach to readers, organization, writing style, and English usage. © 1976, Sage Publications.

Method: The study employed qualitative inquiry methods based primarily on textual analysis and the deployment of codes to assign a summative attribute for course types. Results: The field presently offers 110 certificates, which represents a growth rate of 186% for graduate certificates and a growth rate of 191% for undergraduate certificates. Conclusion: Certificate curricular data show that, unlike other degree programs, there is still no consensus on what a certificate should be and what courses should be required. Questions are offered to help the field start conversations about certificates.""This paper updates Harner & Rich's 2005 survey of undergraduate degree programs in technical and professional communication (TPC) in the U.S. and provides information about the current number of degree programs, locations of degrees programs, and curricula, both required and elective. Method: We used course catalogs to analyze the curricula of 65 programs that offer majors in TPC. We employed qualitative inquiry methods based primarily on textual analysis and the deployment of codes to assign a summative attribute for course types. Results: We located 185 undergraduate programs in TPC in the U.S. that offer majors, concentrations, emphases, tracks, and specialization, a 131% increase from the 2005 study, and restricted our analysis to 65 programs that offered majors in TPC. Degree programs no longer are predominately housed in English departments. The most significant gain is to the number of programs housed in Technical Communication Programs. The majority of programs require 30-36 hours of credit. A set of ""core courses"" are emerging in the field-wide curricula. There is a significant increase in the number of programs requiring document/information design, Web, internship, and capstone courses. In contrast, few require literature courses. Conclusion: Curricular data show an emerging consensus on the core courses and elective courses within undergraduate curricula. In addition, for the first time, the field has data to assess trends over time.""This paper summarizes the characteristics of business communication courses as they are taught in colleges holding membership in the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business.

The universities generally offer somewhat similar though different curricula, and they have common problems. Recognizing a need to discuss these problems, as well as other information, nine universities sent representatives to a meeting at the University of Minnesota. This article reports the salient points of that three-day conference on current university programs in technical communication.""As business organizations grow increasingly virtual, traditional principles of organizational communication require examination and modification. This article considers the curricular implications of the growing business uses of virtual world technology through three different lenses-students as employee-users, students as strategic designers and decision makers, and students as theorists. The instructor's approach to communication principles relevant to persistent virtual worlds should be grounded in current and anticipated business applications. Emerging business practice provides guidance regarding the communication principles and skills that might be required of students entering careers in a contemporary business world of networked, digitized, and virtually enhanced communication. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Technical communicators today must document complex applications used in complex environments. Information about users and use models is important under these conditions, especially if documentation will be presented on-line. Customer partnering, a method of information gathering that supplements surveys, contextual inquiries, usability testing, and interviews, provides one way of involving the users of complex applications in the design of information delivery systems. We used this method to help a client gather important information about user and use models and design a new information library for complex server computer systems.""There is a direct relationship between cybernetics, which is concerned with communication as it controls the behavior of systems, and information theory; indeed, the two are interwoven. This paper presents an historical perspective of cybernetics, examines its characteristics, and is parlayed against its close relative, systems theory. Appropriately, thefundamental concept offeedback is examined in some depth Finally, cybernetics is related to information theory as well as to business communication. © 1984, Sage Publications.

Cybernetics provides the unifying basis for various scientific techniques used in business management today, but computer-aided administration and factory automation are only a start. Eventually, comprehensive systems of artificial intelligence will function at the highest level to direct, not merely manage, the total operation of industry, even the administration of society itself. Clearly, there will be marked impact on human communication, especially in scientific and technical publications for marketing and training.""Arguments manifest in scientific visuals through graphic representation, content placement, and overall document structure. These arguments, designed to influence public perception, change over time in relation to sociopolitical climate. Analysis of a series of documents constructed deliberately to influence perception can help to determine patterns of argumentation and perceived exigencies. In this article, four self-guided tour brochures produced for distribution to visitors to the Glen Canyon Dam in 1977, 1984, 1990, and 1993 are analyzed in order to identify rhetorical strategies designed to influence public perceptions of the dam site, and examine how public perception of the dam, and related argumentation, is structured by sociopolitical climate.""The risk to the safety, identity, and vitality of a community is important for every citizen with a dangerous neighbor, be it military installations, oil refineries, nuclear power facilities, fertilizer factories, airports, or train stations. The historical case of Port Chicago-a failed relationship of a military facility and its neighboring civilian community-offers important lessons regarding the nefarious practice of erasive rhetoric and the missed opportunities for cultivating cooperation and communication. Method: A critical review of historical records and pertinent communications from military and civilian sources uncovers a series of rhetorical practices damaging to the safety, identity, and vitality of a community. Results: The language practices of name-changing, dismissive and derogatory descriptions, passive voice, negative claims, tactical omissions, and elaborate pejorative detail, separately and collectively, serve to fortify the source of danger while erasing the object of danger. Conclusion: This provocative and still timely case challenges technical communicators to bring together officials from military, industrial, and transportation facilities with the residents of neighboring cities for instructive and productive interactions that generate trust, save lives, and preserve communities.""This article explores the basis of the public debate between Darwinian evolution and creationism. Using dramatic analysis, we show that the source for the debate is due to what we call ""Darwin's Dilemma,"" which is found in Darwin's Origin of Species. In the Origin, Darwin extends the mechanistic metaphor featured in Enlightenment science by devising the concept of ""natural selection."" In the process, however, he also ascribes a motive to nature, which moves his theory outside the boundaries of Enlightenment science. We show that he is aware of this dilemma in his theory, and that he tries to pass it off as a metaphorical maneuver for the sake of brevity. Darwin's inability to resolve this dilemma, however, opens the door for purveyors of creationism and intelligent design. Indeed, much of the debate today over Darwinian evolution still pivots on our inability to come to terms with Darwin's dilemma.""This paper describes a data base management system for organizing the program of a conference; the system runs on an IBM-compatible personal computer with hard disk using DBASEIII-PLUS. The system is used for logging papers submitted for review, writing letters of acknowledgment, distributing and tracking papers in the review process, writing letters that notify authors of paper disposition, communicating with session chairmen, and automatically compiling and printing the resultant camera-ready program and author mailing labels. The system has been successfully used for the 1988 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal P cessing, a conference of 1500 submitted papers with a program f 750 papers presented in 56 sessions over 4 days. Use of the system saved 6 weeks and about $3000 compared to the time and costs of this conference in 1987. © 1989 IEEE""The National Technical Information Service is the central source for the public sale of Government-sponsored research, development, and engineering reports and other analyses prepared by Federal agencies, their contractors, and grantees. Current summaries of these reports are published by NTIS in over 30 newsletters, catalogs, and journals. The system used to organize these summaries permits NTIS to create a number of useful information products from a single machine-readable data file. The presentation covers the range of products made available and some of the techniques that are used and that may be applicable to other publishers.""The author of this article believes that data communications will make revo lutionary changes in the field of business communications, and that teachers in the field should immediately become aware of the main problems which data communications technology presents and introduce discussion of these problems into the curriculum. © 1970, Sage Publications.

Polysemic English loan words are particularly problematic in translation, as their meanings do not always match across donor and receptor languages. An Anglicism may, for example, convey a subset of the senses expressed by the same word in English and/or it may convey meanings typically expressed by a synonymous English word. It is no wonder that translator trainees often get into difficulty when having to decide whether and how to translate an English word with an established Anglicism in Italian. This tutorial presents a corpus-based teaching methodology that draws on the data-learning approach devised by Tim Johns and aims to equip translator trainees with a kit of analytical tools for better understanding Anglicisms in cross- and inter-linguistic professional communication so that they can produce accurate and effective translations. After briefly reviewing recent studies of Anglicisms in Italian, I outline the main features of the proposed educational methodology and illustrate how it has been applied to the analysis of the lemma business in the Language for Specific Purposes (LSP) translation classroom. © 2006 IEEE.""Information literacy is an essential skill for business communication students. Traditionally taught by librarians, there is a pressing need for all business instructors to incorporate informational literacy training into their courses. Moreover, students need to hone their research skills, moving beyond a dependence on Google and Wikipedia.

In relatively formal communication settings, the use of titles and surnames is generally sanctioned, although there are some notable exceptions. In relatively informal communication settings, the use of first names or appropriate substitute expressions is generally sanctioned. Business communication teachers can incorporate information about British forms of address into both general business communication and specialized international business communication courses as the provided examples suggest. © by the Association for Business Communication.""The death of a journal is a troublesome exercise, but when all efforts to save it have failed and the decision to dissolve has been made, one should move with the utmost efficiency and speed to satisfy all unfulfilled author commitments and circulation, manufacturing, and advertising contracts. The mechanics and psychology of the termination are considered in the light of the author's publishing experience.""When writers communicate risks about hazardous technologies, they need to realize that their persuasive purposes cannot be to resolve debate but rather to evoke consensus and to encourage new ways of talking about risk issues. To gain insight into achieving such purposes, rhetoricians can learn from theories in the social science subdisciplines of risk perception and communication. Theorists in these fields identify various psychological, social, political, and cultural dynamics that risk communicators must address in order to generate new processes of debate. I apply many of these theoretical principles to a sample risk communication on nuclear energy to determine realistic expectations for persuasive risk communications. My conclusions stress that rhetorical researchers need to explore and test the extent to which written rhetorical forms can facilitate consensus. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

These strategies, which include personalization, imbalance, and competing frameworks, create a type of verbal illusion that emphasizes certain potentialities and eliminates others present within the text itself. Such verbal illusion can be understood in terms of the concept of figure ground, which embodies the idea of visual appearance and disappearance in optical illusions. The success of these verbal illusions suggests that texts have the power to transform perception, sometimes resulting in deception as the reader interacts with the text. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""The author focuses chiefly on the Code of Professional Standards for the Practice of Public Relations, analyzing two specific aspects of this or any professional code: implicit and explicit attitudes toward the public and toward the truth. He argues that professionals confronted by ethical dilemmas in these areas should be able to, but usually cannot, find clear direction in the official code. He suggests that to function truly as a legitimizing document, the code must be expository, analytical, and evaluational, constructed according to six recommendations offered here.""This tutorial on how to teach report writing is based on the premise that decision-making is a complex process that derives from both rational and quasi-rational ways of knowing the world. The author defines quasi-rational to include consideration of hunches, intuition, and tacit knowledge often embodied in stories that have meaning to the decision-maker. Thus, report writing can be approached as a systematic evaluation of options available given goals and constraints, but also as an uncovering of the narratives that decision-makers see surrounding their own lives. The tutorial explains a course curriculum structured in three sections with the following goals and strategies: (1) helping students face personal or family decisions through a traditional decision-matrix process that also incorporates elements of rhetorical stasis theory, (2) using big case studies to reveal the interplay between rational and quasi-rational thought in decision-making, and (3) finding case studies in the students' local geographic regions in order to further explore this interplay. The paper concludes with a brief assessment of how the author's students responded to such a course. © 2007 IEEE.""This article argues that many methodological approaches used in intercultural technical communication research are limited in addressing emerging social justice challenges in many post-colonial, developing, and unenfranchised/ disenfranchised cultural sites, where professional communicators have begun conducting research. It offers decolonial approaches as an alternative by highlighting how these approaches are used in an intercultural research that investigates attempts to localize communication that accompanies sexuopharmaceuticals from one cultural context to another. The article also discusses some the challenges and benefits of such approaches. The ways in which scientific research is implicated in the worst excesses of colonialism remain a powerfully remembered history for many of the world's colonized peoples. It is a history that still offends the deepest sense of our humanity [1, p. 1]. Global research raises many methodological and ethical challenges for technical communicators . . . because of the cross-cultural, international, and transnational nature of the work [2, p. 283].? ©?2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Purpose: In this article I propose an audience analysis instrument designed to assess representative members of a desired target population's underlying predispositions in terms of the sources of information they privilege, their motivations toward environment-related action, and the commonplaces that impact their perceptions of environment-related communication. The goal of this method is to offer a time- and cost-effective instrument that enables organizations to easily classify an audience's interest in environmentalism, assess their willingness to listen to and accept environment-related messaging, and pinpoint the commonplace elements likely to be most useful in constructing environment-related communication. Method: I developed the interview, coding sheet, instructions for completing the process, and glossary that make up the Deep Audience Analysis instrument from existing data presented elsewhere (Ross 2013, 2012, 2008), and refined the instrument through both participatory design and usability testing. Results: The results of my testing suggest that the Deep Audience Analysis tool I propose is both valid and reliable, but training with the instrument would prove beneficial, and triangulation with multiple coders is optimal. Organizations adopting this method of audience analysis would do well to practice with the instrument and have norming sessions before putting the instrument to use in the field. Conclusion: The audience analysis instrument I propose here includes an interview script, code sheet, instructions for completing the process, and glossary. The method proposed here should serve as a time- and cost-effective paper-based strategy for organizations wishing a deeper understanding of their audience(s).""Deep linking, the practice of linking to a subsidiary page rather than the home page of another organization's website, is the subject of considerable controversy. In several recent lawsuits, plaintiffs have alleged violations of copyright, trademark, and commercial laws. In this article, I review the legal and ethical issues regarding deep linking and comment on how the ethical conflict between rights and utility motivates the controversy. I conclude that protecting site owners' rights to control deep linking to their sites is a stronger value than enhancing the utility of the Web for users by allowing completely unrestricted deep linking. Finally, I recommend a collection of resources for Web developers interested in staying current with the evolving controversy.""Requirements of accuracy in technical writing overwhelm considerations of stylistic grace. Analysis of the resulting technical style, however, often reveals a discrepancy between technical and verbal accuracy. The object of verbal form is an accommodation between grace and accuracy. Several avenues to achieve this accommodation are presented from Martin Buber's I and Thou to psycholinguist theorists such as George Miller and Walter Kintsch. Linguistic theory and literacy analysis can also provide means of reestablishing grace, not as replacement, but in contention with technical accuracy. The aims of technical discourse, like that of all other discourse, should include the gracefulness of one human being speaking to another.""One of the basic tasks of the human brain is to maintain order and consis tency among all the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes it retains. A defen sive attitude occurs within people when they encounter communication situations with which they feel uncomfortable or will not tolerate. Defen siveness causes a listener to resist both speaker and message. In addition defensiveness seems to be highly contagious and causes a deteriorating cycle between those communicating. Defensiveness can best be reduced by empathy, treatment of fellow communicators as equals, and genuineness. © 1980, Sage Publications.

Fifty-one research proposals are analyzed in order to understand perceptions of research, and results from a survey are analyzed to better understand how students both perceive and articulate their understanding of research. The data show that students assign multiple definitions to the concept of research, and suggest that increased attention to clarifying terminology and identifying student perceptions would facilitate better work. © 2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The Editing for Quality (EFQ) process is a standard editing process at IBM® Corporation that produces a measurement of the quality of the information. The process has evolved over several years of development and practice—from an original need for an in-process quality measurement to a vital process that not only improves the quality and consistency of information but also expands the skills of both writers and editors. The EFQ process is based on the definition of quality that is described in Developing quality technical information, a book written by several of the practitioners of the EFQ process. This book defines nine characteristics of quality information, grouped in three categories: easy to use (task orientation, accuracy, completeness), easy to understand (clarity, concreteness, style), and easy to find (organization, retrievability, visual effectiveness). Together, these nine quality characteristics and the EFQ process are key elements of an effective quality system for technical information.""Glossaries are lists of specialized word definitions contained in technical documentation that can assist the nontechnical user to comprehend fully the technical topic at hand. In a joint project with SAS Institute, I sought to discover how glossaries were first developed, what guidelines are available for technical writers in the writing of glossaries, and what rhetorical technique might be of value for glossary writers. I found that glossaries are much more than simple word lists; they are, in fact, an opportunity for the technical writer to outline and protect the parameters of technical discourse between a company and its customers across multiple communications channels, and different languages. In an increasingly global technical environment, an explicit connection between the rhetorical technique of definition and the writing of glossary definitions should be made to aid technical writers in this task.""This essay explores heuristic uses of Kenneth Burke's pentad of dramatistic terms for defining institutional problems.

Modern genre theory provides a theoretical perspective for understanding the write-up according to its central purpose: preparing students to participate in the class discussion (oral analysis) of the case. Using discourse-based interviews with genre experts (MBA students and instructors at a case-based business school), the study shows that the write-up prepares students for classroom performance as problem-solvers, managers who can act in business situations, and disciplinary thinkers who can apply academic knowledge to the real world. Each action-problem solving, making decisions, and applying disciplinary knowledge-comprises a set of ""moves"" in the write-up, such as offering recommendations and plans for implementation. Although students may effectively integrate the three actions and sets of moves in their write-ups, they more often confront conflicting demands in preparing to perform for the oral case analysis. The written results are fragmented, even incoherent, case write-ups in the eyes of ""outsiders."" Defining the genre from the perspective of discourse ""insiders,"" however, suggests that the write-up functions effectively in management classrooms to ensure students' engaged performance in the oral case analysis. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""The profession of technical communication is difficult to define in scope, and the work performed by its members is even more difficult to quantify. The work crosses many disciplines and the skills needed to effectively undertake these tasks are broad. In the area of systems development, technical communicators have the skills to perform many tasks, especially those related to human factors, and yet much of their contribution goes unrecognized. A recent survey of Australian technical communicators sought to more clearly identify their work in the area of systems development; this paper presents and discusses the results of that survey.""Practicing the forms of definitions may not produce writing that satisfies the informational needs of readers. This paper discusses definition as a method for engaging students in the process by which thinking and writing test and clarify one another. By first saying all he can about the theoretical and practical meaning of a term, the student can analyze his writing to discover the significances the term has for different readers and the rhetorical devices that best express the meanings. The writer then can compose a series of redefinitions of the term for different readers according to their needs.""This article analyzes two reports describing a now abandoned MagLev (magnetic levitation) rail system that would have run from Ontario, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada. Unlike traditional technical reports, the Budd Company Transit Division’s MagLev reports appeal to utopian visions of futuristic technologies that would solve America’s social and economic problems of the 80s. The writers of these reports thus employ economic and political rhetoric (risk modeling, market projections, appeals to the American dream and “new frontier” mentality, as well as xenophobic Japan-bashing) and downplay technical constraints on rail corridors. The analysis reveals the ethical and rhetorical dilemmas that writers face when the companies they work for seek funding for “new mode” problems that propose untried and untested visionary designs. © 1993 IEEE""This article examines professional boundary work in a set of medical journal theme issues about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Whereas these journals claim as their collective goal to bridge and blur boundaries between mainstream and alternative medicine, this article identifies and describes two chief rhetorical strategies through which the journals instead bolster and even expand those boundaries. These two strategies, constituting and categorizing, appear central to the demarcation of biomedical boundaries vis-à-vis CAM. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."Kirkpatnck's model for evaluating training courses can be adapted to evaluating our products and services.

A sample of 280 chairs provided administrative information about the business communication courses at their institutions, rated the importance of 34 topics typically covered in the course, and assessed the need for the course in their programs. Results indicate that department chairs perceive writing skills to be more important to business communication courses than other communication skills, such as speaking, tech nology-mediated communication, interpersonal communication, team/group com munication, listening, and cultural literacy skills. Implications for business com munication curriculum and research are offered. © 2002, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.""Technical writers modify their main ideas with prepositional phrases.

However, the realization of these benefits depends on effective GVT task coordination, which faces significant challenges due to time-zone differences and geographical dispersion. Further, there is a lack of understanding of optimal information-technology (IT)-mediated coordination mechanisms for these teams. Based on an in-depth study of project tasks carried out by three GVTs, we uncovered IT-mediated task coordination portfolios (sets of mechanisms) used for effective coordination. The portfolios should fit the GVT's task dependence, members' common time frame, and perceived time constraints in order to be effective. © 2011 IEEE.""Acupuncture is increasingly popular as an alternative medical therapy. Its description presents a challenge for technical communicators.

A usability test of C2PC, a C2 system currently used by the U.S. Marine Corps, was performed with 13 Marines as participants. They were given problems designed to require actions similar to what they would encounter during real-world Combat Operations Center (COC) operation. The observations revealed an interesting disconnect between the underlying design assumptions and how beginner C2 operators interacted with the system. They were able to perform simple tasks, but could not combine those simple tasks into realistic tasks. These differences highlight the need for using complex scenarios when testing complex systems. © 2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Human-centered design expands the context and reach of the work of technical communicators and provides an opportunity to investigate and advocate for the needs of vulnerable populations.

This article examines some of the theory underlying why people make errors early in the problem-solving process when they form an intention. Since these errors are cognitively-based and occur before any physical action, it is harder to analyze their cause or incorporate changes to reduce them in a design. It examines factors which contribute to user errors and which designers and writers must consider to produce documents which reduce user errors in forming intentions.""This article turns to the concept of interdisciplinarity as a framework for the design and development of observational studies investigating the discourse of medicine in language-based fields such as linguistics, rhetoric, composition, and professional communication. It argues that observational studies be designed as disciplined interdisciplinary studies, defined as research that makes an acknowledged contribution to both medicine and language studies. It proposes two guiding principles for the design of observational studies in medicine, both of which focus on issues of prospective design.""When designing multimedia presentations, technical communicators must consider navigational aids and the degree of user control, audio cues, color and typographical elements, visual elements, and copyright issues.

This divisionary effect is particularly problematic for World Wide Web hypertexts, which often require ongoing, dynamic collaborations among professionals with diverse specializations. In this article, we examine collaborative processes through theory and two Web project team interactions: one that reflects a failed formal process model, and one that represents a more successful dialogic model. Because dialogic models are non-formal and inherently adaptable, they are thus stronger process models for collaboration, particularly for Web design projects.""As the population of students speaking English as a second language increases, our business communication courses have required changes in both content and pedagogical approach.

However, using a questionnaire across cultures requires extra effort in translating it into the target language(s) and culture(s) because a good questionnaire developed in one language/culture may not necessarily travel well across cultures due to differences in meaning and interpretation. This tutorial synthesizes the extant research on cross-cultural communication and surveys, and provides guidance in preparing cross-cultural questionnaires. Concepts: Translation affects the design and development of questionnaires to be used across cultures in these ways: (1) It affects the theoretical concepts to be studied: indicatorsquestions about concrete elements that can be measured and constructsa series of questions about abstract elements that cannot be measured directly and essentially represent an underlying concept. Constructs must be adapted into a specific cultural context to achieve accuracy in measurements. (2) Differences in the contextsthe overall cross-cultural research context (the setting and the purpose) and the cultural context (the participants and their cultural background) of the studyaffect translation because concepts in the source culture might be applied differently or not exist in the target cultures. (3) Translation might unintentionally introduce bias by inadvertently changing the perceived meanings of terms and questionscreating bias in constructs, on individual items on the questionnaire, and in its administration. (4) Translation might affect equivalence of terms in the source and translated versions, including linguistic equivalence (that is, wording of items), semantics (meaning of a phrase or concept), and grammar and syntax. Suggestions: Given these concepts, consider the following items when translating questionnaires: (1) accurately adapt or adopt questions from existing instruments, (2) make sure that you adapt the language to suit the situation, (3) hire translators who understand research processes, (4) use the decentering approach (a process in which translators move back and forth amongst the languages, checking for cultural and linguistic accuracy) when preparing the actual translation, and (5) assess your overall translated questionnaire. The questionnaire assessment model is a resource for guiding the assessment. © 2011 IEEE.""To share advice about how to create a low-cost usability testing lab based on the results of a year-long process of acquiring funding for a lab that supports Angelo State University's faculty, staff, and students. Methods: Literature review of usability testing labs, trends, and theories; a case study of designing and implementing a usability lab. Results: While there are numerous descriptions and justifications for labs in usability textbooks (Barnum, 2011; Rubin & Chisnell, 2008), Web sites (Nielsen, 1994), and articles (Potosnak, 1990; Blatt et al., 1994), changes in usability technology and decreasing prices allows for the development of new, cost-efficient laboratories in locations that have historically not contained labs, such as small university campuses. This article shares how Angelo State University created an up-to-date, personalized, on-campus lab based on past and contemporary trends in usability testing. Conclusions: A usability lab on a university campus is possible to build, even with limited funding. Moreover, a step-by-step guide reveals that there are 1) strong theoretical reasons for constructing a usability lab, and 2) practical solutions for how to implement a design.""There is a tendency to view education on the Internet as simply a more efficient way to access information and to communicate. But the Internet is much more than just another tool. The Internet has the potential to create communities where students participate in robust discourse and rituals of communication, establish their identities, and traverse community boundaries. We believe we need to design on-line courses with sound pedagogical frameworks and with a sense of promoting community values of diversity, connectedness, and civic responsibility. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe a framework that we use to design virtual learning communities. We explain community activities to consider, describe how we used our framework for designing three classes, and pose issues that arose when using this framework. We hope our thoughts will direct discussion toward the creation of innovative learning communities. © 1996 IEEE.""An operating manual is a key document for training personnel in the operation and maintenance of a new plant. If made available before the startup, it can help avoid costly operating errors. After the startup, it becomes a source of reference for experienced personnel and a source of instruction for replacement personnel. To serve these purposes, the manual should cover startup, routine operations, trouble-shooting, normal and emergency shutdowns, and equipment maintenance and repair. For those learning the process, the information must be technically accurate, clearly written, and in logical sequence. For those familiar with the process, it should also be indexed and arranged for ready access to specific items. Its format should allow easy revision as the process is modified and new insights are gained about operations.""Many organizations have decentralized their operations in an effort to respond more quickly to rapid changes in markets and technologies. Decentralization has legitimatized cross-functional communication and decision making at relatively low levels in these organizations as a means of improving the quantity and timeliness of information. However, decentralization can adversely affect an organization’s communications unless a new communication system is designed as part of the change implementation process. Working within a new approach to organizational change called sociotechnical design, technical communicators can help define performance standards for new communication systems, including those integrated with computer-mediated information systems. © 1990 IEEE""This article discusses how assignments using the Internet can be integrated in an introductory technical communication course without compromising two fundamental pedagogical goals of the course: teaching students how to gather data and how to evaluate it. Three traditional introductory technical communication course assignments (instructions, literature review, and analytical report) that utilize the Internet resources to achieve these two goals are described. © 1996 IEEE.""Approaches that make the translation process quicker and less resource intensive can cut production costs and reduce the time it takes to introduce a product into a particular overseas market. As such, a systems-theory perspective which can enhance the translation process by reconfiguring the ways in which technical writers and translators exchange information is presented. This systems-theory approach can serve as the foundation for intranet resources technical writers can use to design more translation-friendly documents."Follows the decision-making process for an embedded help solution to replace a help system that had trained users not to use it Discusses solutions for implementing embedded help"This article examines a field study I co-authored urging Washington State residents to register online as voters (Mann & Pryor, 2014). Method: Using leading design principles, I created postcards for the Office of the Washington Secretary of State that were mailed to unregistered residents. In addition to measuring the overall effectiveness of the postcards, the study evaluated the differences between two rhetorical messages. Bothpostcards described the same registration process, but one focused on the user-friendly aspects of the online application while the other emphasized that registering to vote is a social norm. Results: Residents in three counties withlarge Latino populations were mailed bilingual English-Spanishpostcards. The total treatment effect was significantly higher among recipients in these counties than the rest of the state but withno noticeable difference between two rhetorical messages. Statewide, the overall results show that the postcard describing the voter registration experience as “fast and easy” was significantly more effective than persuading recipients to register using social pressure. Emphasizing convenience was especially effective among 18-year-olds. Conclusion: The study suggests that election administrators can create a more culturally inclusive voter registration process by designing bilingual outreachmaterials. This article offers several lessons learned for voter outreachdesign and discusses potential avenues for the continued study of culturally inclusive UX practices as applied to voter registration outreach. © 2017.

It presents a case study of how one course has evolved over the years, presenting not only the lessons learned and the changes made at each stage, but the rationale for those changes. Looking at learning as the combination of information and interaction, the paper describes how the instructor went from being the Sage on the Stage to being the Sage in the Cage, to being the Guide on the Slide, to finally being the Guide on the Side. It also documents how the course went from being technology driven to learner driven, and the evolution of an activity cycle. The paper ends with a rationale for design changes and implications for current and future designs. © 2004 IEEE.""This case study investigates how a group of novice technical communicators used appeals to support their design decisions during group meetings. The results of this ethnographic study suggest that although these technical communicators were well acquainted with user-centered design (UCD) concepts and claimed to actively practice UCD, their appeals often did not reference data collected within user-centered research and instead referenced designer-centric appeals to support their claims. This group's overall use of appeals to support their design decisions suggests that more empirical study into UCD theory and practice as well as students' argumentation skills is warranted. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""Recent years have seen extraordinary growth in thefield ofscientificand technical communication. Video, computer, electronic-publishing, and telecom munications technologies have challenged traditional print dominance among the media. As schools nationwide attempt to meet the needs of a new generation of technical-communication leaders, it is appropriate that we explore what distinguishes a comprehensive graduate program in this new field. By examining leading programs, assessing industry's needs, and sketching a profile of an ideal graduate communicator, we are able to set goals for curriculum, staff, facilities, resources, support, and administration of a state-of-the-art graduate program in technical communication. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Doing so develops user trust and, consequently, more effective communication between human and machine. Displays in the form of menus, prompts, and help messages should be clear and consistent. To achieve clarity and consistency in graphic design, the author suggests using the reference grid in which a series of lines determines overall frame dimensions, defines essential areas for text, and specifies the number of columns. Typography, particularly line length, is important. If lines are too long, reading speed is slowed. Lower-case letters, which have more variety of shape, are generally more readable than all capitals. Tabs are most usefully set every five characters.""Describes the challenges that complex Internet applications, such as digital marketplaces, present to information design Asserts that to overcome these challenges, we must utilize dynamic internet technologies to create a new paradigm of user assistance"Describes three critical attributes for designing effective virtual worlds for communication Offers practical guidance of what works and what matters when using virtual worlds to communicate Shares lessons learned and offers guiding questions for technical communicators and instructional designers.Explores the feasibility of wearable EPSSs Investigates human factors considerations in designing wearable EPSSs Discusses collaborative uses of these systems"An in-house word-processor training course can be developed to meet the specific needs of a firm and of the students.

Because the histories and cultures of the United States and Mexico differ significantly, written communications also differ. Rhetorical strategies for written business communication in Mexico reflect the country's bloody, cyclical history and its resulting culture characterized by collectivism, high power distances, fatalism, and emphasis on building trust and relationships. Despite Mexico's economic problems, it is a country in transition. Because of the increasing presence of US business entities in Mexico, communication protocols are changing as US technology and ways of doing business infuse the traditional Mexican culture. Understanding how to communicate effectively in Mexico requires understanding its history and culture as well as changes occurring there. US writers must know where any Mexican company is situated along this changing cultural continuum and how the continuum shapes the design of written business communication.""This first of two pieces on desktop publishing (the other may be found in the Book Review department) constitutes a critical overview of the important new field of desktop publishing in terms of its particular significance in technical communication.

Course designers created a list of competencies and behavioral objectives for each of four modules: business writing fundamentals, formal report writing, informative oral presentations, and persuasive oral presentations. Students receive the list before instructions. Students also gain instruction in class or through self-study or both. They are assessed through multiple forms of assessment, and those assessments are measured in relation to individual demonstration of competencies rather than course norms. In general, the students, faculty, and administration have viewed this course positively.""This paper describes the development of the AntConc corpus analysis toolkit, originally designed for use in a technical writing course at Osaka University, Japan, but now adopted in institutions throughout the world as an easy-to-use, freeware, multiplatform alternative to the many commercial concordance programs.

Then, I will give an overview of tools in the most recent version of AntConc and explain their value using examples from the classroom. Finally, I will discuss some of the software's limitations and future developments, and suggest applications in professional communication. © 2006 IEEE.""The author believes that the communication needs of college students of business can best be met by a rigorous writing course which stresses the logi cal and developmental aspects of writing. He feels that the reason a “subject matter” of communications has intruded into writing courses is that teachers have felt the mere writing course to be trivial. But the special field of communi cations with its own lingo and jargon is not what is needed to add stature to the business writing course. What is needed is a higher-level approach to writing which spurns the “for mula” approach of most cur rent business writing textbooks. © 1968, Sage Publications.

We begin by summarizing the context of our project and our search for a QA framework that would fit the specific institutional goals and constraints at SPSU. We then present the framework of principles we settled on, provide the rationale supporting our choice, and explain how we adapted this framework to better suit our situation at SPSU. We then recount how the framework we recommended influenced the development of a new student feedback questionnaire for online courses at SPSU. We also describe the current status of the project to implement a QA review process for online courses, using an expanded version of the checklist we developed. In closing, we discuss some implications of our experience that may be helpful to others working in higher education."Identifies and describes two skills pertaining to global communication: writing for translatability and global design  Discusses the development of an updated set of training aids to assist authors in developing their global communication competency."To explore strategies, goals, and practices that are part of a sustainable content strategy for the evolution and development of the technical communication body of knowledge and, by implication, other bodies of knowledge. Method: To develop a sustainable content strategy for the body of knowledge project, informed by content analysis, user generated survey data, and benchmarked trends from other knowledge bases. Results: An important part of content strategy for a large-scale knowledge base, such as the TCBOK, involves innovating practices with regard to the information taxonomy, tools, content assets, and information development standards, as the product and user base matures. Successful technical communication knowledge bases employ taxonomies with higher level topics that represent specific disciplines and subdisciplines within technical communication. Integrating the human user into content strategy involves a complex interplay of user expectation and feasible decision making. Conclusions: Developing a body of knowledge, particularly over time, may require an integrated or hybrid approach to content strategy, involving a complex set of factors that include the human user, content assets, and sustainable practices. Content strategy goals and objectives are also a function of the maturity of the user base and the content itself within a body of knowledge.""As technical writing programs grow, English departments may alleviate the problems of the unprepared instructor by offering technical writing theory and pedagogy courses.

A set of dedicated guidelines for the construction of such tutorials was recently advanced in Technical Communication (Van der Meij & Van der Meij, 2013). The present study set out to assess the cognitive and motivational effects of a video tutorial based on these guidelines. Method: Participants were 65 students (mean age 12.0 years) from elementary school. The procedure was as follows. First, students completed a pre-test. Next, they viewed videos and completed practice tasks. Finally, students completed a post-test and retention-test. Results: The pre-test revealed low scores on task relevance, and low initial task performance. During training, students reported positive mood states, high flow, and significantly higher task relevance than in pre-testing. Task performance rose significantly during training, and was also substantially higher on the post-test and retention-test than in pre-testing. Only cognitive factors significantly predicted task performance. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the video tutorial attests to the quality of the design guidelines on which it was based. The critical contribution of specific guidelines are a potential area for further research.""This article addresses emerging calls for online education and cross-cultural technical communication training, specifically by outlining and reporting on the development and sustainability of two online programs: the graduate online technical and professional writing certificate and the emerging undergraduate bilingual professional writing certificate at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Here they outline how they developed approximately 400 effective illustrations from engineering drawings and describe a comprehensive program to get the necessary photographs for the manuals. These manuals to MIL specifications cover operation, theory of operation, service, repair, and installation; they require a full gamut of technical illustrations, including schematics, wiring diagrams, logic diagrams, block diagrams, timing diagrams, mechanical drawings, graphs, internal and external photographs, parts-locating views, procedural photo sequences, and waveforms. It is emphasized that technical illustrations are discussed here from a writer's viewpoint, not from an illustrator's viewpoint. The purpose is to show how the writer/editor determines what illustrations are appropriate to use and where to seek source data. Illustrations were developed with somewhat limited resources, both in allocated funding and in manpower support. These constraints probably reflect the current norm for technical publishing. The TMs discussed are manuscripts, not final printed publications. Illustrations shown are deemed suitable for a draft edition. Of concern here is not the rendering, but the content of the illustrations and how this is perceived by the writer/editor.""The interactive processes of effective global managers need to be explored to identify, describe, and apply concepts supporting international management communication competence. This article synthesizes various theoretical approaches and concepts central to communication competence, simultaneously interspersing this framework with illustrations in the context of international management. Its purpose is to provide information that is useful for developing research questions, pedagogical models, or effective management communication practices. International management communication competence is a cognitive process that involves acquiring (1) cultural awareness and understanding, (2) language knowledge (verbal and nonverbal), and (3) the motivation to use cultural awareness for the development of global business relationships. This process develops in two stages: enculturation within one's native society and realization of the reality, validity, and distinctiveness of other cultural values and norms.""This paper addresses the importance of developing leadership skills in the encoding and decoding of nonverbal messages. It takes the position that impressions formed in superior-subordinate relationships are often deter mined by the nonverbal communication that occurs in face-to-face meetings. Based on social exchange principles, a situational view of considerate leadership behavior is developed where a superior attempts to make inter action less costly and aversive to subordinates by adapting to them non-verbally. A taxonomy of nonverbal displays of status, consisting of kinesic, proxemic, and temporal norms, is presented, which shows how supervisors often abuse the physical presence, personal territory, and time of their employees. It is suggested that superiors become more aware of these sig nificant nonverbal messages. © 1981, Sage Publications.

For multivolume proposals typically submitted to the U.S. Government, the overall proposal strategy the proposal manager conceives and implements represents the master blueprint that serves as the basis for strategies for individual volumes and sections within these volumes. Although the overall proposal strategy is critical for producing a credible proposal, success can come from following additional strategies the proposal manager must devise and implement at key points during the proposal development schedule: Will-to-Win Strategy; Customer Development Strategy; Assessing the Competition; Pricing Strategy; Tactics and Themes; Proposal Presentation Strategy; Review Strategy. © 1991 IEEE""Wordless instructions can circumvent language barriers, both technical and international, but several cycles of testing and revising are necessary to ensure their effectiveness.

However, many other stakeholders without a legal background are involved in the negotiation, drafting, approval, and implementation of contracts, and their contributions are essential for successful business relationships. How can we ensure that all stakeholders in the global business context-whatever their native language or professional background-easily and accurately understand contract documents? This study suggests that integrating diagrams in contracts can result in faster and more accurate comprehension, for both native and non-native speakers of English. Literature review: We focused on the following research topics: (1) ways to integrate text and visuals to create more effective instructions, since we conceptualize contracts as a type of business instructions; (2) cognitive load theory, as it may help explain why contracts are so hard to understand and why text-visuals integration may ameliorate their understandability; (3) cognitive styles, as individual differences may affect how individuals process verbal and visual information, thus allowing us to explore the limitations of our suggested approach; (4) the English lingua franca spoken by business professionals in international settings, their needs and challenges, and the fact that pragmatic approaches are needed to ensure successful communication. Methodology: We conducted an experiment with 122 contract experts from 24 countries. The research participants were asked to complete a series of comprehension tasks regarding a contract, which was provided in either a traditional, text-only version or in a version that included diagrams as complements to the text. In addition to measuring answering speed and accuracy, we asked the participants to provide information about their educational background, mother tongue, and perceived mental effort in task completion, and to complete an object-spatial imagery and verbal questionnaire to assess their cognitive style. Conclusions: We found that integrating diagrams into contracts supports faster and more accurate comprehension; unexpectedly, legal background and different cognitive styles do not interact with this main effect. We also discovered that both native and non-native speakers of English benefit from the presence of diagrams in terms of accuracy, but that this effect is particularly strong for non-native speakers. The implication of this study is that adding diagrams to contracts can help global communicators to understand such documents more quickly and accurately. The need for well-designed contracts may open new opportunities for professional writers and information designers. Future research may also go beyond experimental evaluations: by observing this new genre of contracts in vivo, it would be possible to shed light on how contract visualizations would be perceived and interpreted in a global communication environment. © 2017 IEEE.""This article explores the dialogic negotiation processes that can enable professional communication academics and practitioners to collaborate in designing, implementing, and writing up research.

The differences derive from the need to adapt the meanings of existing expressions or to find new expressions for different things and to borrow expressions from different cultures. Separation and slow means of com munication also cause differences and encourage one side to retain archaic expres sions that others have abandoned or modified. The differences in vocabulary can be grouped into four categories: the same expression with differences in style, con notation, and/or frequency; the same expression with one or more shared and dif ferent meanings; the same expression with completely different meanings; and dif ferent expressions with the same shared meaning. These differences in vocabularies affect understanding of all varieties of English. To bridge differences in Enghsh language vocabularies, international business communication teachers and trainers must devote more attention to English as the dominant language of international business, create awareness of important vocabulary differences that have the potential to confound intercultural communication, and develop and teach strate gies for bridging the vocabulary differences of English speakers. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Nonlawyers pay a great deal of attention to the details of incongruent messages. When confronted with discrepant information, they actively seek facts which might eliminate the incongruity. Lawyers, on the other hand, characteristically reject the entire incongruency or temporarily tolerate or accept it. For this reason, the author believes, communicators, i.e., union and management representatives to the arbitration hearing, would be advised to make changes in their messages that are appropriate for both lawyer and nonlawyer recipients. © 1977, Sage Publications.

Using data from one survey and one interview-based study of the work of Technical communication and Training groups, as well as participation on committees responsible for certification examinations for technical communicators and trainers, this tutorial analyzes differences in the occupational cultures of the two fields. Key concepts: The work differs: technical communicators produce content that explains how to perform tasks; trainers produce programs that develop skills that a third party can verify. To do so, technical communicators follow a process that emphasizes writing and production; trainers follow a process that emphasizes the analysis of intended goals and evaluation of whether those goals have been achieved. The guiding philosophy of Technical communication is usability; the guiding philosophy of Training is performance. Although both disciplines are rooted in cognitive psychology, the primary intellectual roots of Technical communication are in rhetoric and composition, while the primary intellectual roots are in education. The preferred research methods of Technical communication are critical; the preferred research methods of trainers are empirical qualitative and quantitative methods. Key lessons: As a result, Technical communication professionals and researchers who want to work in training should approach the field in a culturally appropriate way by (1) recognizing distinctions between a communication product and a training program, (2) recognizing distinctions in work processes, (3) recognizing distinctions in language, (4) recognizing differences in values, and (5) acknowledging that an academic discipline of training exists. © 2012 IEEE.""The author suggests that scientific and technical material be written at five successive levels of abstraction rather than the two normally employed (the full report and the abstract). Of these five levels, only the higher three would normally be published. The two lowest levels, comprising an author's extensional, first- person statement, and a complete, formal report, would be printed separately and mailed to readers at their request.""For knowledge workers, such as IT professionals, the ties within their social network are a major channel for communicating the requisite knowledge and information. While prior studies tended to favor higher network centrality (i.e., larger volume of network ties), in this study, the researchers argue that centrality can reduce communication efficiency if the diversity of the ties is low. Research question: Which characteristic of communication ties, volume or diversity, has more influence on knowledge workers' performance? Literature review: Using social network analysis (SNA) as the theoretical framework, a review of the literature shows that social network ties have important performance implications because they can enhance an individual's access to valued resources. Studies have also examined the performance impact of ""hindrance network centrality,"" or how frequently a person is described by other network members as a hindrance to their performance. However, current research has overlooked the possible negative communication consequences of centrality in regards to redundant information, which may negatively affect job performance. Methodology: The current study employs a quantitative approach, using the standard SNA method of a ""name generator"" questionnaire to collect network data. Participants were 98 people in the IT department at a large defense company. We identified 3905 relationships and analyzed them with the UCINET software. Subsequently, social network variables, as well as performance and human capital variables were analyzed in logistic regressions. Results and discussion: Results showed a significant relationship between constraint, a measure of tie diversity, and performance. Centrality, the measure of tie volume, however, was not significantly related to performance. Our findings about the volume versus diversity of communication ties have important implications for professional communicators in the age of fast-growing social network media. A limitation of our study is that we approximated communication ties with social network links. We suggest that future studies further validate our findings by using a more direct measure of communication ties. © 2012 IEEE.""In this paper, we analyze Chief Executive Officers' letters to shareholders in the United States petroleum industry during the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on the industry's turbulent relationship with OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries). We discuss and deploy the methodology of critical hermeneutics. The ""texts"" of the CEO letters, when juxtaposed against the ""context"" of key historical events, suggest that these letters were deployed to produce a certain attitude toward OPEC among their readers that deflected attention from the crisis of legitimacy faced by the oil companies domestically. We suggest that the trope of Orientalism helps us understand what exactly the texts sought to achieve through their pronouncements about OPEC. © 2002 by the Association for Business Communication.""As multimedia communication continues to grow, online technologies have dramatically changed the ways we use and present information - so much so, that we need new theories and models for understanding how technology and content are related in the new communication environment. This paper presents a theory of digital architecture, explains how SGML, HTML, and Information Architectures are related in the creation of a new online literacy and rhetoric, and discusses concepts, skills, and resources needed for educating tomorrow's technical communicators.""The article discusses consumer attitudes toward direct mail advertising as of 1965. The Direct Mail Advertising Association-sponsored A. C. Neilson Co. study of consumer attitudes revealed that: 33 percent of adult heads of U.S. households enjoy all direct mail, 36 percent indicate a general dislike, 16 percent say their attitude varies with the item received and only 5 percent indicate a dislike of all kinds of mail. Neilson also broke the information down into categories of types of mail: (1) Charitable appeals and medical crusades, (2) Advertising and selling and (3) Mail order catalogues. The objective of the study was to measure consumer response and reaction to advertising as an institution and to specific advertisements.""Describes the activities of a university “directed research group,” highlighting interesting tensions that emerged thereinAsserts that actively exploring such tensions with students creates a rich learning environment""The present study performed a content analysis on 157 electronic mail files received over the course of several months by a middle level manager in a computer services depart ment of a large organization. The mail was coded and analyzed according to the direc tion of the communication through the hierarchy of the organization, the communication function of the mail, and whether or not the mail contained a redundant signature. Significant differences were found (chi-square=45.40, p.001) in the communication function according to the direction of the communication. Vertical mail was more restricted in function than horizontally directed mail and was used primarily to exchange information. The presence or absence of a signature in the mail reflected the direction mail was sent through the organizational hierarchy. Subordinates and others signed mail signiftcantly more often than superiors (chi-square=18.62, p.001). The present results describe the communication functions and paralanguage found in electronic mail in one organization. Based on these results, the impact of electronic mail use upon the organizational communication system is discussed. © 1988, Sage Publications.

These manuals, however, specify many disciplinary discourse norms that writers need to follow in publishing scientific research. Consequently, these manuals provide an important and reliable source of information about how communities of working scientists conceptualize, construct, and publish their scientific texts. The disciplinary norms that these style manuals promulgate derive both from general scientific research practices and from the practical demands of scientific publishing. Because of their unique normative nature and their connection with scientific practice, disciplinary style manuals should be categorized separately from other types of scientific style manuals, and the material they contain can reliably be used in technical writing and editing.""Instead of just recording thoughts, printing itself can be used as a means of communicating ideas. Writer and publisher should collaborate to produce an article or a book in such a way as to make its organization and meaning more clear. ″Discourse punctuation″ encompasses the inclusion of an outline; underlining, both thick and thin; boldface words, phrases, and sentences; brackets or boxes around important sections; marginal markers and notes; various printing styles, type fonts and sizes; and the use of color. The intent of these effects is to increase the reader's immediate understanding and thereby to increase the speed and efficiency of reading. The format of this article demonstrates some of these suggestions.""To determine whether there are different technical styles, syntactic structures at three audience levels in the published writing of three disciplines were analyzed. The disciplines considered were engineering, agronomy, and home economics, the audience levels were popular, semitechnical and technical. Analysis discloses that different disciplines rely primarily on different types of subordinate clauses, sentence openers, and sentence types. It also discloses that paragraph length varies with audience level, as do the number of subject sentence openers and the kinds of verb constructions. Next, the authors compare their findings with standard textbook treatments of style and advocate a more flexible approach to the teaching of technical style, one that accounts for variations in subject matter and audience.""A post hoc analysis of data collected from a usability test on the Fluke ScopeMeter 97 (a diagnostic instrument for analyzing electrical signals) revealed that, in doing tasks, subjects were making use of their own internal metaphors (user-generated) that were unsupported by the design of the ScopeMeter keys. We investigated the interaction of the user-generated metaphors and designer-generated metaphors. By examining the effects that the subjects' skill levels and their backgrounds had on employing such metaphors, we began to outline certain characteristics of user-generated metaphors. We found that user-generated metaphors demonstrate unyielding persistence in the minds of ScopeMeter users, particularly in the higher skilled subjects.""To examine how blogs reflect practitioner views of professionalization topics (such as education, professional societies, and value and status). Methods: Content analysis of 10 practitioner blogs, focusing on professional topics of status, education, professional societies, and the effects of technology. Results: Although the bloggers under study appear to function as an effective community of practice, they are not currently directing their actions or attention toward the traditional goals of professionalization, such as licensing and accreditation. Conclusions: The latent themes that emerge show that many of the goals of professionalizing (such as standardizing routes into the field and increasing respect for the work) are also concerns of practitioners.""To examine how blogs reflect practitioner views of professionalization topics (such as education, professional societies, and value and status).

The technical graduate takes much longer to train as a writer, but he learns the technical subject much more quickly. The more complex the subject, the more likely the technical graduate is to be selected - and the longer it takes for him to become a skilled writer. How the problem was partially solved at NCR by the use of a restricted vocabulary is explained. An unsolved part of the problem is identified, and readers are urged to help find the solution.""Tables are a compact way to present data but graphics aid the analysis of data.

A sample of full-time employees completed a multi-instrument questionnaire. Findings indicated that dissent expression related to both employees' work engagement and their intention to leave. In particular, dissent expressed to management and coworkers associated with work engagement, whereas dissent expressed to nonmanagement audiences associated with intention to leave. Additional analysis revealed that for managers, work engagement was primarily a function of refraining from expressing dissent. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article invokes Habermas's ideal speech situation to analyze the controversy surrounding a recent study of pain relief for women in labor. Using Habermas's concepts, the authors argue that distortion of scientific and medical information originated in the New England Journal of Medicine article that first reported the study's results. Thus, their analysis aims to complicate the assumption that such distortion starts only with public reporting and to expose the ways that scientific or medical research from the beginning can be reported to either facilitate or preclude public debate and understanding of complex issues. © 2008 Sage Publications.""This article presents data from a long-term, qualitative study of writers appropriating new software tools for note taking. Instead of asking whether a writer knows how to use the discrete features specific to a software program, I argue that we might more profitably ask about the properties of functional systems that allow writers to flexibly meet the demands of their literate activity.""The diversity of society today requires people to interact with others who have different cultural backgrounds. The simplest communication can be complicated by nonverbal factors. This study used a pretest-posttest design to deter mine the effect of an intervention treatment consisting of students viewing pictures of people and identifying attrib utes based solely on what they see. Then in groups the students discussed their varying interpretations. The findings were that the treatment made students more aware of nonverbal factors and how they are involved in interper sonal communication. © 1995, Sage Publications.

More specifically, it documents communication and interpersonal problems commonly experienced by organizational members who are perceived as being dissimilar, and it supports a two-pronged approach to fostering a more equitable workplace. This approach suggests that organizations use mentoring programs solely as a long-term strategy and that they use discreet and consistent supervisory disclosures of task-relevant information as a short-term strategy for achieving real equity and fairness in business communication. © by the Association for Business Communication.""While institutions of higher education are enthusiastically embracing technology-mediated learning (TML), little research has been conducted to identify factors that influence student use of TML tools or determine whether use of them increases student learning. This study of business communication students at two universities found that (1) students tend to be sensing, visual, active, and sequential learners; (2) perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of TML tools are positively associated with perceived learning success; (3) learning styles do influence the students' usage behavior of certain TML tools; and (4) students' sensing/intuitive learning style is related to their perceived learning success. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""Senior U.S. business executives reported that in making recent promotion decisions, they had placed a great deal of weight on candidates' interpersonal skills, less weight on oral communication skills, and even less weight on writing skills. Older business managers ranked communication skills as more important than did the younger managers. If this age-related difference is a maturation effect, younger managers may place more emphasis on communication as they mature. If the age-related difference is a cohort effect, the relative importance of communication skills for advancement may shift as Generation X executives replace boomer executives in top-level positions at U.S. corporations. © The Author(s) 2013.""Reports competencies from the 10 largest undergraduate programs and survey ratings of core competencies by 67 technical communication managers* Compares managers' opinions with skills that technical communication programs stress""After reviewing the controversy over inclusion of grammatical instruction in composition and communication courses, this article details a data-based study that explored the relationship between grammatical proficiency and a number of variables in an introductory business-communication course. Empirical data suggest a small, but significant correlation between grammatical proficiency and success in writing the formal report. The data suggest that a stronger correlation exists between grammatical proficiency and performance in the overall course, and that grammatical competency is a predictor of successful completion of the course. The article explores other minor correlations, suggests the implications these correlations have for business-communication courses, and recommends other areas of study. © 1988, Sage Publications.

When the instructions violate the rules, the reader either gets confused or feels justified to stop reading. By writing the instructions this way, the company tried to protect itself from lawsuits. It is shown that these instructions do nothing about liability. The better, less expensive, and only way to write instructions is to respect the reader's common sense.""This study compares the annual report letters written by the CEOs of 30 U.S.-based companies and 24 Latin American-based companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Using a grounded theory approach, the authors thematically analyzed both sets of letters to ascertain common topics, stylistic (writing) features, and embedded cultural attributes. They found that although both sets of letters share much regulatory and financial information, the Latin American letters are characterized by a richer mix of topics, a more complex writing style, and evidence of cultural dimensions as conceptualized by the research of scholars such as Geert Hofstede and Edward T. Hall. Their work is founded on the belief that corporate documents exist to communicate more than factual information to their constituencies. Rather, the purpose of corporate writers is to influence public opinion and attitudes, particularly among potential investors, in ways that create support for organizational practices or undermine opposition to them. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""When money is short, two-color printing is often the first thing to go from technical manuals and instructional texts. Does their effectiveness suffer as a result? Conversely, when a second color is used, is it often just a waste of money?

The article summarizes Medicare Part D, discusses the characteristics of potential enrollees, and provides an overview of document-based decision making. It uses a rhetorical framework to evaluate the Medicare documents as decision-making tools, arguing that design flaws hinder users' understanding, discourage them from taking appropriate action, and negatively shape perceptions of ethos. The article concludes by discussing implications for functional documents more generally, underscoring the importance of a design cycle that is both user-centered and performance- centered.""This paper describes the documentation effort undertaken by the Danish CIM/GEMS (Computer-Integrated Manufacturing: General Methods for Specific Solutions) project to drive, direct, and support its CIM-technology development and transfer activities. The project recognized that in the phases of CIM development—from planning through maintenance—the primary deliverable is not the CIM system itself but the documentation used to describe, specify, justify, and support its development and use. As a result, the project organized itself so that it would transfer to its industry participants the information needed to build CIM systems, and not CIM technology alone. Because this information best resides in well-written and complete documentation, the CIM/GEMS project adopted a “management-by-document” approach, treating documentation activities as part of system development and assigning professional personnel to the task. Documentation was produced in the same PC environment used for technical development. As a tool for project management, documents organized the project around concrete deliverables representing phases of technical development. Their completion signaled the end of one phase and the beginning of another, thus giving the project a concrete indicator of its productivity and a way to measure progress. As an archive of CIM-system development, they captured the project’s in-progress work and the knowledge of developers who performed that work. As a deliverable, they were the principal means for carrying CIM knowledge and experience off-site. Finally, as a product of concurrent development, they made it possible to develop and transfer technology simultaneously, thus reducing the delay typically associated with technology transfer. © 1991 IEEE""This article is the second of two articles (see E. Mc- Daniel et al.,IEEE transactions on professional communication, June 1991, pp. 83–93) discussing ways to create system documentation and use it to drive and manage technical development in technology-transfer projects. This article again explores the two-year Danish CIM/GEMS project in computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) at the Technical University of Denmark to show how writing is an act of technology and knowledge representation, a vehicle of their transfer to a user community, and, if successful, an accommodation of technology to its users. The article addresses creators and users of system documentation who need documentation for CIM implementation. The authors argue that documentation is often better for representing and explaining a CIM system than the actual system itself, and they recommend that documentation production not be viewed as a separate, end-of-project activity but as an integrated part of technical development. Planned and regular documentation production can in fact be a stimulus and aid to technical development, possibly even shortening the project life cycle. © 1992 IEEE""Investigates how computer-industry companies create end-user documentation and training materials, and how they measure productivity Describes results of interviews of 11 managers of publications or training departments"A complete and accurate record of the events and details of a construction project is valuable in evaluating project costs and it serves to substantiate claims and help in the recovery of damages.

Five ″levels″ are identified, Level 1 being aimed at the most technical audience, using special language, and having the function of documenting. From this level, the characteristics of the documents are intended for increasingly less-technical audiences, the language becomes increasingly general, and the purpose increasingly ″communicative″ . Examples of each level are given as follows: Level 1: Project Reports, Progress Reports, Trip Reports, Laboratory or Field Notebooks; Level 2: Interim Reports, Memos, Reviews; level 3: Completion Reports, Feasibility Studies, Engineering Reports, Technical Papers (from Completion Reports), Technical Articles (from Engineering Reports); Level 4: Management Bulletins, Budget Reports, Sales Brochures (from Level 3 Technical Articles); Level 5: Press Releases.

In the first experiment, the departures had no apparent effect. In the second, test materials were modified to allow subjects additional working time and significant effects favoring the unaltered forms of the variables were found. In the third experiment, subjects were told that they would not be held unaccountable for performance and the judgments made, and even stronger effects favoring the unaltered forms of the variables were found.""Reports the results of an eye-tracking experiment to assess the impact of the isolation of a visual element on its relative ability to attract a viewer's attention* Reviews the logic underlying eye-tracking studies""There are no prior studies comparing modes of communication for virtual teams working over a substantial period of time that combined an initial synchronous desktop audio or video meeting with subsequent text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC). Research Questions: Does the initial medium condition impact decision-making quality, creativity, group development, and process satisfaction? Literature Review: Previous literature on media richness (the ability of a medium to carry and reproduce information based on feedback, multiple cues, language variety, and personal focus) and group outcomes (the level of creativity and quality of the work delivered by the group) suggests that ad-hoc groups using asynchronous CMC alone (without any initial meeting) or asynchronous CMC combined with an initial face-to-face (FTF) meeting have significantly higher levels of creativity and decision quality, compared to single-mode synchronous CMC groups or FTF groups. Methodology: In this study, a laboratory experiment was conducted with 136 participants from 14 countries. All teams used asynchronous CMC for two weeks for a software requirements task, following an initial synchronous meeting in one of four conditions: FTF, desktop audioconferencing, desktop videoconferencing, or text only. Results and Discussion: Results suggest that there are no significant differences among the four conditions. This research indicates that it does not matter what medium is used for an initial short meeting of a group that is to subsequently work together via asynchronous text communication. © 2011 IEEE.""Positioning of information may be the major problem in preparing a résumé.This study attempts to determine whether a primacy or recency location of facts produces the highest fact-recall rate. © 1973, Sage Publications.

One-to-one teaching could be better used through the study of behavior and the individual verification of ideas. The author refers to research in the utilitarian verification of ideas and the frequency of error, and he takes note of the difficulties inherent in translation. The role of the teacher in this age of new training methods is clear. He must not only explain concepts but also the different expressions used to refer to them.

First, an outline is given of the main stages in problem-solving. This outline offers a broad framework for the two studies of current practice that follow. The first study focuses on the accessibility of help. It examines how often manuals fail to offer the right keywords, and how often they have not marked or have misplaced problem-solving information. The main conclusion is that most manuals pose formidable obstacles to accessing help. The second study investigates the main reasons for presenting problem-solving information as a Regular Step, as a Skipable Action, or as an Afterthought. The main finding is that writers or typographers tend to opt for a different design than what is theoretically best. © 1996 IEEE.""Effective communication is essential for efficient management. Yet, the problem of communication is exacerbated when the manager is required to function in a foreign culture. Communication in a foreign country is often complicated by such cultural influences as the importance of time, space, relationships, and numerous other subtle psychological and sociological factors. Merely learning the language of a host country is not sufficient to effectively conduct business abroad. To be truly effective, a manager must not only understand the language of the host country but must also 'have a feel' for its culture. The present article suggests that managers preparing for overseas assignments be familiarized not only with the language of the host country but also with the psychological and sociological norms inherent in that particular culture.""Relying on examples taken from the business section of the Corpus of Nineteenth-Century Scottish Correspondence (in preparation), this paper intends to discuss the linguistic means employed to express authority and convey stance in relation to different recipients (peers, superiors, or subordinates) and different subject matters (e.g., legal controversy as opposed to ordinary, routine transactions). In particular, the aim is to present a survey of the positive and negative politeness strategies adopted by encoders of varying status (e.g., bank officials, publishers, but also working-class contractors). After a general outline of the corpus currently being compiled, different cases are discussed, in which hierarchical discourse is observed. Our concluding remarks focus on the implications this type of study may have for sociohistorical linguists on the one hand, and the study of the earliest stages of professional discourse on the other; indeed, the latter aspect may be of considerable interest also for present-day practitioners who may gain insights concerning the pragmatic strategies that have proved to be most successful over time. Similar ways of encoding stance and distance, for example, are still found in present-day formal exchanges, though the focus is probably more on corporate identity, rather than on individual participants. © 2006 IEEE.""While technical writing continues to struggle for recognition as a legitimate academic discipline, English programs are increasingly perceived not only by nonacademics, but by academics in other fields as having little relevance in nonacademic professions. Internships are routine components of technical communication programs, but they can offer excellent professional opportunities to English majors who do not plan academic careers. A technical communication internship program expanded to encompass the nonacademic needs and interests of English majors has benefits for the English department, for English majors, and for the technical communication profession. First, it can enhance enrollments and retention in the English program. Second, it can build the credibility of the English curriculum in the nonacademic professional community. Finally, it can enhance the credibility of technical communication within the English department. It is to our advantage to do whatever we can to support our English department colleagues rather than to undermine their often precarious status in the academy and in society.""Over a quarter century ago, James W.

Gould discusses the international and cultural diversity evident at the convention, the importance of global perspectives in business communication, and the leadership of the ABCA in this effort. ""This article discusses some of the ethical dilemmas faced by writers who prepare marketing materials in engineering organizations; such writers include traditional technical writers whose documents are influenced by the marketing interests of the company and “boundary spanners” who write both technical and promotional materials. The article describes social, political, economic, and legal changes in the professions during the last 30 years and the growing influence of market-driven decisions on ethical decision-making. It briefly surveys the marketing literature that engineering marketers are reading. Finally, it suggests a question that marketing writers should ask themselves in examining rhetorical choices. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Having assessed the English skills of those students at the end of the semester, we found a statistically significant increase in the performance of the students who had taken the TWT in comparison to the control group who spent the time of TWT doing more traditional exercises. This result indicates that technical writing books and journals should be considered as an important source of information for teachers of writing to ESL students.""The use of visual representation to learn science can be traced to Louis Agassiz, Harvard Professor of Zoology, in the mid-19th century. In Agassiz's approach, students were to study nature through carefully observing, drawing and then thinking about what the observations might add up to. However, implementation of Agassiz's student-centered approach has struggled with the conflict between science as a form of developing ""mental discipline"" in which mastery of scientific facts is the goal and science learning as a socially situated activity with an emphasis on the process of learning, not merely its products. Present-day attempts to have students draw to learn science often succumb to these same conflicts, limiting their full realization."Interchangeability and random assembly and replacement of parts depend on uniform drawing interpretation. Geometric tolerance helps by using symbols to show relationships among part features so that a part can be accurately and economically produced. The method divides a part into a number of geometric shapes and assigns size values to each."Some years before e-mail and Web-based hypertext became important features of professional communication, it was observed that information has always had higher value if it was organized in small chunks that could be accessed and sequenced at random. A library with an index of separately accessible books is thus more often useful than one long, linear scroll of text. This basic insight has been rearticulated in recent research into the utility of different kinds of electronic media.""A mathematical model proposed for the dynamics of fast fluidization to account for vertical voidage distribution, has been used to correlate the experimental data obtained in a 9-cm-diameter column with a height of 8 meters. The results are shown in a flow regime diagram spanning from particulate and bubbling fluidization, through turbulent and fast fluidization, to dilute-phase pneumatic transport.""A brochure that had been revised on the basis of feedback from readers using the plus-minus evaluation method was evaluated again using the same method. This article compares the results of these two successive evaluation studies to examine the dynamics of evaluating and revising using a troubleshooting method based on verbal self-reports. The findings show that the plus-minus method does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the number of problems readers find in a revised document. But the types of problems readers find are significantly different. For example, after the brochure was revised, it had fewer clarity and structural problems, and readers could focus more on credibility issues. © 2006 Sage Publications.""With the development of new technologies, and particularly information communication technologies (ICTs), teams have evolved to encompass new forms of interaction and collaboration. By focusing on the communicative dimensions of global virtual teams, this paper demonstrates that e-collaboration is more than a technological substitution for traditional face-to-face collaboration. It places special emphasis on the importance of structuring activities for balancing electronic communication during e-collaboration (i.e., videoconference, email, chat session, distributed use of group support system) to bridge cultural and stereotypical gaps, to increase profitable role repartition between the participants, and to prevent and solve conflicts. During the past four years, the authors have developed a project involving hundreds of participants from different national cultures working together for six weeks on a specific project. In this paper, we present our experiences and draw conclusions, giving special attention to the structure of the electronic communication required to support efficient virtual teaming in education and industry.""This paper looks at the collaborative design activity involved in a design experiment of an electromechanical plunger. Much of the coordination was achieved through internet-based communication. As mechanical and electrical researchers involved in the design project, we discuss the information exchanges highlighted by our different professional cultures and relate how these exchanges lead us to propose some methodology to improve the efficiency of virtual meetings. Moreover, we show the need for new communication tools, ones dedicated to specific tasks that are not currently supported, especially shared concept formalization among technical experts.""This study applied communication boundary management theory to examine employee responses to workplace e-mail monitoring. Specifically, a measure of perceived workplace e-mail privacy (PEP) was developed and fit to a model of antecedents and consequences. To accomplish this, the study used an online survey methodology to gather employee perceptions related to workplace e-mail monitoring. Results indicated that PEP is a two-dimensional construct capturing one's proficiency at maintaining privacy and concerns about the organization's ability to infringe on e-mail privacy. In support of the boundary management perspective, the data revealed that perceptions of workplace e-mail monitoring and PEP were related to the perceived quality of one's workplace relationships, especially with top management. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Although e-mail recipients rely on nonverbal cues to form impressions of senders, relatively little is known about specific contextual factors that may influence sender perceptions in computer-mediated communication. Results from an experiment found that the receivers' personalities influenced their perceptions of the e-mail sender both directly and indirectly through perceptions of nonverbal cues. These results support the notions that the meaning of nonverbal cues is contextually bound and that receivers' personalities influence perceptions of both nonverbal cues and senders. Implications for managers and organizational performance are discussed. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""Early Cold War professional communication teachers anticipated posthumanist awareness in our culture. They were also granted more agency for progressive action than many of their contemporaries. By showing the different ways that these scholars responded to their posthuman situation, this study articulates how posthumanist theory complicates the progressive notion of a student-centered classroom and, more importantly, explains what happens to the progressive project when it is more explicitly connected to posthumanism. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""This study is designed to examine two design approaches: skeuomorphism and flat design, in both American and Chinese contexts. Questions explored include, What underlines this new design trend in American vs. Chinese cultures? How has this new design emerged? How will it evolve in the future? What culturally, underwritten aesthetic and rhetorical principles are at play? Method: Samples of user interface (UI) design are collected from both cultures and examined to compare similarities and differences wherever possible. In-depth textual analysis is used to deconstruct particular design cases. Results: Our analysis indicates that while flat design is the new trend, skeuomorphism has its place in UI design; each design has its advantages and shortcomings; and effective design may require the integration of both approaches. Our study also reveals that designs are culturally sensitive and that each particular design is contextualized and rhetorical. Flat design’s popularity in the Chinese context has its unique rationale due to social, ideological, cultural, and linguistic reasons. Conclusion: Savvy designers combine professional taste and culturally sensitive perspectives to produce effective designs that work for their particular contexts. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

This article reports on the adoption and use of Kindle eBooks on the campus during the Spring 2010 semester. The authors report on how the eBook supported student learning and course outcomes, and they examine the results of survey assessments of the eBook project. Overall, the university believes that the pilot project conducted proved to be a success, and the campus will continue using tablet devices in the future. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper addresses eco-discourse by the corporate rhetor that emerged in the wake of two environmental disputes. While such green business rhetoric might be conventionally viewed as a category of crisis communication, it is treated here as an instrument of corporate sensemaking and discursive struggle. Specifically, I analyze the ""language games"" between the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and its critics that arose over Shell UK's plans to decommission the Brent Spar and Shell Nigeria's operations in Ogoniland, a tribal community in the Niger Delta. I demonstrate that Shell's rhetorical contests had constitutive effects on its environmental and human rights policies and practices and led to its cautious embrace of the language of sustainable development. Combining sensemaking and Foucauldian approaches, I argue that such local conflicts over meaning-making around the natural environment must be understood in terms of discursive struggle at the socio-political level where they both reflect and influence the dynamics of cultural and institutional change. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez struck a reef, releasing 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. This study examines Exxon's communication efforts in the wake of that disaster and identifies communication practices on Exxon's part that damaged the corporation's credibility, antagonized the public, and contributed to the public perception of its corporate arrogance. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Jameson, an associate professor of management communication at Cornell University, delivered at the International Convention of the Association for Business Communication, October 30, 2008, in which she discussed the role of the academic field of business communication in the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, miscommunication in business, and how the field might help prevent or reduce the severity of future financial crises."Technical communicators can (1) improve the quality of publications of even smaller companies; (2) achieve substantial direct cash savings; (3) release research and development staff from over-involvement in publications activities; and consequently (4) provide new business potential. A case history shows how one company successfully realized these goals."Differences exist between oral and written communication. For example, as a spoken message passes from one person to another, the accuracy of the message declines. Furthermore, 50% of what is heard will soon be lost and within two days there will be another loss of 25%. This article argues that written communication, thoughtfully and thoroughly revised, is a better way. The author asserts that the average length of a letter or memo can be cut in half with no change in meaning by purging it of three forms of clutter: redundancy, deadwood, and roundabout phrases. The author lists 236 redundant expressions she has found in business and technical writing and indicates words to be deleted.""Because the motivation of individuals to publish greatly exceeds resources for publishing, selection of papers is necessary. The selection procedures are not unique; the editor and associate editors send the manuscripts to experts in the field for advisory opinions. The paper must fit the mission of the journal, it must be technically sound, the conclusions derived compellingly from empirical data, and, finally, it must be interesting and significant, i. e. , be cited frequently in future research. Significance is fairly nonobjective and judgmental; what is one person's significance is another person's trivia.""For technical editors accustomed to preparing manuscripts for print, editing in the new medium of the World Wide Web can prove challenging. This article suggests how technical editors can prepare themselves by adapting the Levels of Edit concept, long used in the technical editing of books, articles, and reports, to deal with the different requirements of this new medium.""The author, a Briton, presents an informal case-study of two years as Publications Secretary at a Nigerian agricultural research institute. The difficulties and frustrations he faced are described.""When faced with mathematical material, editors with limited technical training often address only superficial concerns such as format and punctuation. A few simple guidelines, however, can help us do a more complete job. We first delete superfluous symbols, then make certain that the remaining symbols are defined properly, redefined where necessary, and used according to the rules of grammar. © 1990 IEEE""The special problems that are introduced by mathematics are considered. More so than in any other forms of writing, the editor of mathematical copy must give as much consideration to the typographer as to the reader. Mathematical composition is very expensive and complex, and typographers depend heavily on instructions from the editor on just how copy should be set. This is especially true if the typographer is unaccustomed to mathematical composition."The principal obligation of the editor charged with editing visual media is to understand the strengths and the limitations of both text and visuals so as to make informed media choices. The following paper compares and contrasts visual and verbal media in an effort to provide the reader with some practical guidance in making media choices. This paper also offers a set of practical guidelines for the use of visuals that is intended to ensure that the visuals chosen and their utilization result in both efficient and effective communication of the kinds of ideas best suited to presentation in pictorial form."To survive, technical journals must continuously attract readers. The author is primarily concerned with the accuracy and validity of any statement about his work. Only the editor can act as the advocate of the readers, making sure that the author's message will be at all times understandable. This paper explores methods of working with authors on the readers' behalf. The editor, in his first contact with the author, must establish a climate of cooperation and inspire confidence. A booklet of author's aids is often useful in the joint planning of an outline. By identifying one or two first principles - which can serve to initiate a reader who is unfamiliar with the subject - and then developing a logical sequence of ideas, the author can make a firm start towards a more successful draft. Proper editorial management and systematic planning of communication between editor and author can improve readability and thus sustain the interest of present readers while attracting others.""The technical editor has the responsibility to educate writers as well as readers. By teaching his clients better ways to express themselves, he facilitates communication across disciplinary lines. This article argues for elevating the editorial function and presents means to that end. It suggests ways to eliminate the worrisome details of writing so that an author can concentrate on substance.""This special issue was assembled and edited for us by John D. Pettit, Jr. of North Texas State University. It consists of some of the papers and articles that were a part of the 1973-75 ABCA Research Committee Reports. While it has not been possible to show all the fruits of the committee's labors, it is hoped that this sampling will testify both to the productivity and the promise of ABCA research. © 1976, Sage Publications.

This process will bring to the fore the journals which demonstrate a better understanding of the needs of readers. Journals that survive will in all likelihood be those which see their role as making understandable to readers a significant selection of the insights of specialists. To fulfill this mission, the editor will need to have the appetite and the ability to continue learning; he must have the interpersonal skills to make effective use of a board of expert advisers; and he must wage a tireless campaign for all the elements of good communication. For the multispecialist technical journal, these are the dimensions of survival. The format of the surviving journals will emphasize refinement of the mature communications techniques, at least for the next 10 or 15 years. Few, if any, of today's journals exploit the full scope of good writing and editing, functional drawings, photography, typography, page design, and offset printing.""The practicing technical editor quickly realizes that regardless of author or subject, the same grammatical errors occur repeatedly in manuscripts. This can probably be blamed on a fundamental weakness in the training of technical writers, rather than on any lack of individual or collective ability on the writer's part. With this in mind, ten errors commonly found in technical manuscripts are collected and presented. It is hoped that the list will be helpful to teachers of technical writing and to technical writers who wish to improve their craft.""The EPC concept is based on sharing the use of highly automated editorial, production, marketing, and business systems by a group of publishers large enough to attain useful economies in operation. The EPC is viewed as a way to provide computer support to the publishers of many small scientific journals that are currently experiencing technical and financial difficulties. Studies directed toward generalized conclusions about the EPC, in all its organizational and economic complexities, have been supported by the National Science Foundation since 1973. Results from these projects and plans for the future are discussed.""Although computer technology has been introduced into virtually every phase of scientific communication, relatively little use has yet been made of it in primary dissemination, perhaps because of the limited operational scale of the typical scientific publisher. An Editorial Processing Center (EPC) is conceived as a mechanism for combining small publishing operations to achieve a scale great enough for significant computerization while leaving each editor in full command of his own publication. The EPC's computer assists authors, editors, and referees to perform their essential, intellectual functions by relieving them of nonessential, programmable functions. Its final output is a magnetic tape for use in photocomposition. Its potential benefits include immediate operating economies, more effective communication, a base for innovation in the form of publication, and benefits to secondary processers and analysis centers. A number of questions remain, however, chiefly in relation to the exact operating point at which any given configuration would become economically advantageous. Work is in progress to provide the answers.""To make documentation a strong link rather than the missing link between users and data processing systems, this guide introduces the professional - but not programmer - writer to software documentation. Included are recommendations on scope, conventions, language, types of instructions, and aspects of format and layout. Procedures for reviewing and updating must also be considered and the draft document must be tested.""Education in the field of Technical communication has not kept pace with the growth of the profession. An examination of the qualifications of a professional technical communicator, i. e. , a grasp of basic sciences, an understanding of communication theory and practice, and a sensitivity to people, provides the basis for a formal curriculum in technical communications."This paper presents estimates of the education and training requirements for detailed scientific and engineering occupations. GED and SVP levels are translated into yearly equivalents and the variances in these requirements are derived for the same occupation in different industries and for different occupations in the same industry. The changes in education and training requirements for scientists and engineers in the past decade are estimated and educational attainment in these occupations is compared to occupational requirements. Some implications of the findings presented here are briefly discussed and several serious deficiencies in United States occupational data are identified.This article describes the kind of work done by the proposal writer in the aerospace industry and then offers suggestions on how educational institutions can better prepare their students for this work."A survey of 182 employees participating in writing workshops reveals some differences in writing practices, based on the educational level of the employee, and suggests that employees with advanced degrees (e.g., master's or doctoral) vary most noticeably from the other groups. In particular, it seems that a large percentage of workers with graduate training write long reports, write to other experts in their field, and spend time revising. Additional research needs to be done on the impact of educational level on writing practices. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

While satellites have been used for nearly a decade for various kinds of scientific experimentation and military applications, they have only recently been programmed into the problem solving process in areas generally considered social in nature. Moreover, in the education category of social services, the educational satellite experimentation is just getting underway. Personnel of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for example, in cooperation with researchers of the Federation of Rocky Mountain States and the Appalachian Regional Commission, are presently undertaking a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of using a satellite in the educational process. such an undertaking is a new experience for the educational community. While educators have a background in the introduction of technology at the classroom level, their experience with the systems approach to the use of educational technology is very limited. Consequently, a frame of reference for integrating such technology into an educational system is needed. Such a frame of reference is developed in this paper.""This study analyzed the effects of publisher contact information on the credibility of online health information. Participants (n = 144) rated the credibility of webpages with a ""Contact Us"" link more highly than pages that had no contact information. Other types of contact information (street addresses and email links) did not significantly affect the credibility ratings. Qualitative results indicate that the ""Contact Us"" link served as a peripheral cue to credibility, rather than triggering conscious analysis. This paper also discusses how the effectiveness of credibility cues can vary according to reader characteristics. © 2009 IEEE.""An investigation was undertaken to determine the effect of system pressure on jet penetration in fluidied beds. The study was conducted in a 0. 305 m semicircular, transparent column fitted with a 2. 54 cm diameter nozzle over a pressure range of 345-5171 kPa. System pressure was found to increase jet penetration significantly more than existing correlations predict.""The effect of proposal appearance on technical evaluation scoring was examined experimentally. Two mock proposals were prepared - one from the A Corporation and the other from the B Corporation. Each proposal was prepared in two versions - a ″nice″ appearing version (stylized ″logoed″ pages, offset two-color printing, heavy paper stock, plastic 19-ring spiral binding), and a ″poor″ appearing version (single-spaced typed pages, xerox reproduction, cheap transparent plastic cover, staple binding). The proposals were scored against a set of eight evaluation questions by twenty-eight experienced government evaluation in a 2 multiplied by 2 factorial design experiment. No statistically significant effects of appearance on evaluation scoring were detected. A general model is presented that describers impression in terms of proposal appearance versus proposal through content. The experiment is interpreted in terms of this model, and ″real-world″ applications of the model are discussed.""This study investigated the effects of two different computer texts on readers' recall with three different content types (Blocked Constructs, Ordered Constructs, and Detail Layered Constructs) based on individuals' different working memory capacities. The findings indicated that the format and content types influenced how well information was remembered among readers. Participants with low working memory who read traditional scrolling text produced better recall scores than those who read the paged hypertext in two of the three content types. However, for those with high working memory capacity, all results came out differently depending on the content types.""This review of the relationship of law and art in the litigative context explores ways in which the methodologies of the novelist and other artists can be invoked by the lawyer in structuring and developing a case and presenting it to a court. To the litigators who transcend the form books and stereotypes and see their cases with afresh eye, neither the law nor the facts are fixed in stone but rather created to meet the deepest realities of the case within the context of our most fundamental values and beliefs. Litigators, by the way they define and project the issues, can affect, even determine, what law and facts are legally relevant and dispositive. They must devise and write the story that threads the client's way out of the labyrinth. Mastery of the formal requirements of litigative writing is only a necessary first step. Freewriting; Hemingwayesque choice of words and syntax; harnessing the symbolic, often hidden, power of language; achieving the dramatic potential of case presentation - all these and more from the creative artist's repertoire empower litigators to win their cases. Resort is made not only to the applicable statutory, regulatory, and case law but also to the processes of the like of Cezanne, Conrad, Hemingway, Tolstoy, Joyce, Aristotle, and Faulkner.""This article discusses the employee newsletter as a medium of managerial communication and details the newsletter's usual contents and functions.

Furthermore, students should be aware of such errors as the following: poor board work, lack of movement and enthusiasm, overuse of notes, monotonous voice, poor eye contact, repetition, and the use of slang and colloquialisms. To make effective oral presentations, one should develop an extensive vocabulary and should evaluate his delivery.""Although volumes of material have been written and published on performance appraisal, few articles have tried to ascertain the perspective of the practicing manager in problems that he or she faces in dealing with performance appraisal systems. The authors interviewed over 60 managers who administered performance appraisal in a large Fortune 500 service organization. They found that managers expressed four problems with existing schemes of performance appraisal. First, multiple uses of appraisal documentation caused validity problems in ratings of performance. Second, most ratings schemes were subjective and inflated, with few guidelines for objectivity. Third, objectives for effective performance were not clearly defined, and finally, information about performance appraisal was not always communicated clearly to employees. © 1985, Sage Publications.

The cost of publication and dissemination is small in proportion to the total expense of a research investigation, but research may nevertheless be impeded by library deletions arising through inadequate correlation of library and research budgets. High-quality periodicals, both primary and secondary, that do not recover part of their costs through page charges are particularly vulnerable in times of economic retrenchment and as a result of recent interpretaions of copyright law. Proposals to reduce primary publications to printed summaries, with details available on request by photocopy or microfilm, do not serve the best interests of the researcher.""This article treats the specification design, data collection, and application of effective writing techniques.""All managers are also subordinates, and their effectiveness as a subordinate often determines how high they move through the organization. Seven hundred managers filled out questionnaires and provided critical incidents in order to determine the determinants of effective subordinancy.

They can be static or dynamic depending on the subject matter. The speaker should take advantage of the availability of these aids: to attract attention, to hold that attention, and to reinforce the understanding of the technical material furnished. An efficient operation can be achieved through coordinated utilization of the aids in conjunction with the address.""The growing use of television to popularize science and technology has generated a trial examination of the motives, the dynamics, and the effectiveness of the process.""This study aims to show the effectiveness of a business communication course offered in a business school in India. All students who enrolled for the Master of Business Administration program in the school were considered for the study. The study adapted a pretest and posttest approach to find the effectiveness of the course. It also describes the curriculum offered and methodology followed in the school. The results show that the course was effective in improving the oral communication skills of the students. The study also discusses the implications for business schools, faculty, and students. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""This is an investigation of the effectiveness of viewing three types of visual presentations over different intervals of time. The treatment presentations were specifically designed to test the ability of viewers to recall cognitive information from a linear, two, and four image program. Evaluation of recall measured by a multiple-choice test instrument administered immediately, twenty-four hours, and seven days after the treatment. Three 16mm motion picture presentations were made of forty still cartoons used for all treatment presentations. The findings of the investigation point the direction between the relationship of recall and retention in viewing multi-image programs when cue summation and redundancy are not considered.""The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the cultural intelligence of a dyad (a team of two persons) on its global virtual collaboration processes and outcomes. Research question: Does a dyad's cultural intelligence have an effect on global virtual collaboration processes and outcomes? If yes, which effects does that cultural intelligence have? Literature review: We review literature on the management of cultural diversity in global virtual collaboration and cultural intelligence. The literature suggests that cultural diversity in global virtual teams is mainly managed with rigid approaches, which are ineffective in many situations. Leveraging cultural intelligence has the potential to improve global virtual collaboration. However, its effects at the team level or in a virtual setting are not yet clear. Methodology: We used a collaboration simulation with 70 participants recruited from two public universities in China and Germany to study the effects of cultural intelligence. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through questionnaires, voice recorders, and computer logs. Bale's interaction process analysis was used to code the voice recordings, and ordinary least-squares regression was used to test the hypotheses. Results and conclusions: The results indicate that cultural intelligence has an effect on global virtual collaboration; the lower cultural intelligence and the higher cultural intelligence in a dyad exert different effects on global virtual collaboration. Specifically, the lower cultural intelligence significantly influences the frequency of collaborative behaviors, which further influence group satisfaction. In contrast, the higher cultural intelligence significantly influences the deliverable quality. The findings advance the understanding of the effects of cultural intelligence at a dyad level and on proximal behavioral outcomes. The study has practical implications for global virtual collaboration practitioners and collaborative virtual environment designers. The study is limited by using student subjects and a self-report measure of cultural intelligence, as well as by examining global virtual teams in their simplest form. Future studies are suggested to examine contingency factors on the relationships between cultural intelligence and global virtual collaboration processes and outcomes. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Electronic meeting systems (EMS) technology can effectively support groups in a diverse set of meeting functions. The introduction of the Groupwriter tool allows group composition of documents in a highly efficient environment. To test this tool, we conducted an experiment to compare the quality of policy and procedure documents written by groups in three face-to-face treatments: (a) those using the EMS Groupwriter tool with a planning guide; (b) those using pen and paper with a planningguide; and (c) those using only pen and paper. The dependent variables were planning quality, document length, document quality, and member satisfaction with document quality. We found that EMS technology significantly improved planning quality over manual support. EMS groups wrote longer documents and, in comparison to manual groups with imposed planning, better documents. Member satisfaction with document quality was not statistically different for all three treatments. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Specifically, each of 57 first-year business students in three sections of a business composition course wrote in response to either (a) two traditional assignments, (b) two short case scenario assignments, or (c) two lengthy, elaborated case assignments. Participants' letters were scored using a performance criteria rating scale for determining both overall quality and specific trait quality. Results indicate that the case assignments generally produced more effective writing products than did traditional paradigm assignments. Results also indicate that the elaborated case assignments generally produced better writing products than did the short case scenarios. However, results also suggest that the writing of participants who already possess business-related experience was not as affected by assignment type as the writing of inexperienced participants. Finally, qualitative measures suggest that the writing processes and attitudes of participants. completing the case assignments were highly sensitive to audience and context, whereas the processes and attitudes of participants completing the traditional assignments were highly sensitive to organization, format, and correctness. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Downward communication received some statistical support as both moderator and predictor of job performance and job satisfaction in low individual-job congruence situations. Upward and lateral communication had some support as predictors but lacked support as moderators of job performance and job satisfaction in high individual-job congruence situations. These conclusions are derived from this research that examines the moderating effects of communication direction on individual-job congruence and work outcomes (performance/satisfaction). Data from 302 employees who reported job scope, growth need strength, job performance, job satisfaction, and communication direction (upward, lateral, downward) were used for the study. Moderated regression analysis was the statistical technique applied. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study develops and tests a structural equation model of the effects of persuasiveness, salience, and uncertainty on participation in innovations. It focuses on a communication process crucial to the eventual innovativeness of large companies: the process by which an innovative manager secures support in the early stages of an in novation from other managers. The model was tested on data gathered from a large financial institution (N = 210). In general, the results were supportive of the model with an acceptable overall goodness of fit and measurement model. The results suggest that the classic communicative variable of persuasion had a paramount impact on participation, reinforcing the notion that communication is central to innovative processes within organizations. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Although the lack of perceptual congruence between superiors and subordinates concerning various issues which affect their relationship is probably due largely to communication problems in the dyad, only a few studies have directly addressed the perceptual congruence between superiors and subordinates. One immediate conclusion of this study is that the managers in the sample perceived themselves to be much more adequate in communication than did their own subordinates.""In this study, we explore the effects of channel choice (e-mail vs. voice mail) and message structure (direct vs. indirect) on the receiver's perception of bad-news messages. We conducted an experiment in which bad-news e-mails and voice mails were presented to participants who evaluated their response to the messages via a questionnaire. The results indicate that e-mail is more comprehensible, while voice mail is more persuasive and effective for maintaining a personal customer relationship. Furthermore, messages with an indirect structure (explanation → bad news) are valued more highly than direct messages (bad news → explanations).

Individual users can use virtual communities to engage in knowledge sharing. Professional communicators need to understand and adapt to a globalized and flat world, where people across different cultures interact freely and easily with one another in virtual communities. An intriguing question regarding virtual communities relates to whether national culture affects communication and types of knowledge sharing. This study examines the influence of US and Chinese national cultures on types of knowledge-sharing activities in virtual communities. The findings indicate that national culture differences between China and the US are also evident in virtual community environments. © 2010 IEEE."Examines the effects of pictures (screen captures and input devices) on documentation for older novices Argues that screen captures help reduce memory load and support visual scanning for older users"Two studies of interviewer training are reported. In the first, no differences were found between trained and untrained interviewers in applicant characteristics used to judge acceptability. In the second, three different training programs were examined. Training on avoidance of rater errors produced changes in the manner in which the in terview was conducted. Results are discussed in relation to changing specific behaviors of interviewers through training. © 1989, Sage Publications.

As many similarities as possible in the general characteristics of age, background field of study, and initial attitude towards the course were sought in order to measure the effect of a variance in presentation of material. The first class was taught by the traditional lecture technique; the second, by individual consultation.""The article discusses a study by Arthur L. Blumenthal concerning the syntactic relationships of subject-predicate elements within a sentence in written communication. Blumenthal's research suggests that receivers do have syntactical boundaries. Readers remember groups of words as units and either recall all the unit or none. Locating the subject at the extreme left position of a sentence may be more efficient from a writing point of view, but it is not more efficient from a reading point of view.""Most technical documents rely on a combination of text and visuals to communicate their messages. To achieve the desired effect of improved processing and comprehension of operating instructions, the text must guide readers in a clear way to the relevant visual information in order to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretation, and to ensure that the reader optimally benefits from the available information. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""The area of communication That intrigues the computer industry is at the human-computer interaction level, where the machine meets the human mind, and where information is exchanged. The presentation layer, or user interface, to computer programs acts as a shield to a far more complex array of processes. Yet by simple navigational and functional commands, the user should be able to manipulate the computer program and achieve the desired results quickly. This is not always the case, however, and deficiencies in both usability and information access continue to plague “ordinary” computer users. Unlike the pioneering days of the 1950s, computing is no longer the domain of engineers and technicians. Today, with increasing public reliance on computer-generated information, powerful computer applications must be amenable to non-technical users. This paper explores the most commercially viable and prominent of these efforts, with particular emphasis on the evolving role of artificially intelligent technologies. © 1993 IEEE""After Gutenberg's introduction of movable type and the printing press in the fifteenth century, and due to the influence of the Renaissance, Western culture entered a period of visual efflorescence. Then, due mainly to the influence of the Scientific Revolution, there occurred a derogation of visual experience in favor of word and abstract number. In the late twentieth century, however, technology, supported by developments in scientific theory, has given new efficacy to visual thinking and experience. Increasingly, illustrations of various types are employed to give meaning to otherwise incomprehensible data. Today's technical communicator faces an important challenge: he must learn to deal effectively with the new demands of a visual culture. He must become an eideteker. © 1991 IEEE""The article presents a speech by Stephen E.

With video rapidly becoming a major instructional method, the question arises of their effectiveness for software training. This paper provides a set of eight guidelines for the construction of instructional videos for software training. Method: The guidelines present a concise view on how to design an instructional video for software training. They are based on a considerable body of research on how people process visual and verbal information and how to support these processes. Each guideline is described, illustrated, and supported with research findings from various disciplines. Results: The guidelines were tested in three consecutive empirical studies. In these studies a set of instructional videos for Word's formatting options were designed. The effects of the video instructions were compared with a paper tutorial (Van der Meij & Van der Meij, in preparation). We found that the video instructions yielded more favorable appraisals for motivation, higher skills proficiency immediately after training, and better skills retention after a one-week delay. Conclusions: The guidelines offer patterns that could further advance the theory and practice of the design of instructional videos for software training. A limitation of the study is that we concentrated on instructional video that serve a tutorial function. For video that function as a reference guide not all the guidelines are equally important, and also some new guidelines may be called for.""This paper presents suggestions for improving instructional text under three main headings: prose materials, graphic materials, and typographic considerations.

The letters sent to Edison in the days following the September 16, 1878, story reveal the many discursive worlds that Edison’s work touched on and had meaning for. They indicate how a technological accomplishment is also a multiple, complex social and communicative accomplishment, creating place and meaning for the new technology within the many discursive systems by which people assign value, identify uses, and create goals incorporating the technology. Edison’s ability to connect with each of these meaning systems paved the way for the development of the technology, providing financial and social resources for Edison that his competitors did not enjoy. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Retooling is difficult because their nontechnical backgrounds and predisposition toward language per se constrict their view of how they can operate most effectively; their linguistic abilities render them textually bound; they sometimes view word processors as computer devices best used by technical typists and clericals; management traditionally takes a narrow view of their job skills and aptitudes; and increasingly sophisticated software enables hard-working clericals to use word processors effectively. To survive, today's writers and editors must open their eyes, master the word processor and use it effectively, grasp the ″big picture″ of document and information processing, and, at all levels, perform as information processing managers, not as wordsmiths only.""The author presents effective leadership styles and skills for moderating online meetings and facilitating electronic groups.

This article remedies that deficiency in our literature, claims the author. The method used is to give examples of cliches, Latinisms and other confusing writing techniques as words and expressions to be used. The author recommends long paragraphs, complex sentences, the passive voice, abstract rather than specific terms, as many words as possible for a concept, nouns instead of active verbs, lawyerisms, excessive use of commas, redundant expressions, and piling-up of nouns. His final word is to 'eschew simplicity and embrace obfuscation - and write to impress, not express'.""Research about writing and teaching writing indicates that it involves the simultaneous coordination of hand, eye, and brain. Because of the inseparable nature of thinking and writing, writing need not be preconceived and planned but can be a means for discovering a purpose and inventing a plan. Good writers can be self-made, and taught, as well as born. One learns to write by writing, over a period of time. Trainers should be successful writers (for credibility) and adapt their methods to individual needs and differences.""Institutions familiar to the public are defined by master narratives that describe their activities and imply who is invited to take part. For art museums in this country, a master narrative of elitism was established in the last century, when museums organized and began building their collections. Because art museums were designed by the rich and subsequently forced to depend on the rich for financial support, the stories of elitism and exclusion have been perpetuated over the years. Whereas little narratives, or local stories, defining the daily operations of museums do not receive attention, stories of exclusive social events and obscure art exhibitions take prominence and discourage the participation of the general public. With diminished funding for museums and fewer courses devoted to art appreciation in public schools, museums will likely be unable to attract wider audiences to support them, and the master narrative will continue to define museums' image.""Elsie Ray, a research librarian at Anaconda Copper Mining Company, was the prime mover in the effort to organize the Association of Technical Writers and Editors (TWE), one of the organizations that eventually became the Society for Technical Communication (STC).

In particular, we focus on whether Media Richness Theory and Social Influence Theory hold for communication between subordinates and supervisors in different cultures. To test this hypothesis, a comparative cross-cultural field study with knowledge workers (n = 120) in the telecommunication industry in the United States and South Korea was conducted. This study demonstrates that country, task equivocality, and communication direction are the factors that affect individuals' media choice. Communication direction was found to be the strongest factor influencing media choice for Korean employees, whereas task equivocality was the dominant factor influencing media choice for US employees. This study also demonstrates the influence of national culture on media choice among US and Korean employees. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed. © 2009 IEEE.""Personas have long been an important tool for technical communicators to use to understand audiences. However, a recent critique of personas questioned their usefulness as a tool for audience analysis. This article takes that question as the starting point to offer a re-conceptualization of persona creation. Method: A comprehensive review of the literature with a case study as an extended example provides insights into the necessity of updating update how technical communicators create personas. Results: The literature review exposes major gaps in the research about persona development that, when compared to the case study, shows the need for technical communicators to update the dimensions of how personas are created and to reclaim the emphasis on goals and purposes of the user’s practice. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to re-conceptualize the creation of personas by incorporating additional dimensions that create embodied personas for a mobile world and that reclaim and refocus the persona’s emphasis on goals and purposes rather than simply a focus on audience. These changes allow technical communicators to meet the needs of users of complex information systems and, thereby, to contribute more meaningfully to user experience projects. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Because of the technical and scientific nature of air quality inspections, increasing public involvement, especially the involvement of those in a predominantly African American and a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, has been a challenge. This article describes the Bureau's journey through the information level, where the Bureau opens public access and participation in the investigation and reporting process; the consultation level, where Bureau staff go door-to-door in poor and minority neighborhoods collecting citizen feedback regarding perceived environmental hazards; the engagement level, where the Bureau conducts monthly environmental meetings with neighborhood residents; and the collaboration level, where citizens are taught to collect evidence of environmental violations. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""This is the Outstanding Researcher Award Lecture presented at the 1992 Annual Meet ing of the Association for Business Communication.

This article analyzes instances of joint laughter in leader-member meetings where laughter may or may not be associated with humor. The method applied is conversation analysis in which the focus lies on laughter's role in the microlevel organization of interaction. The results show that the instances of laughter do not occur in accidental locations but are clearly connected to specific activities. First, humor and laughter can be strategically used by team leaders to create collegiality and a good working atmosphere in their teams. Second, laughing together is connected to closing down a topic or a phase in a meeting in a way that displays mutual understanding. Third, shared laughter initiated by team members appears to be a resource that can be used to reduce tension in challenging situations such as the accomplishment of difficult tasks or the treatment of delicate topics. Finally, laughing together can be used to do remedial work in problematic or conflicting situations. Ultimately, joint laughter appears to be a resource that can be used to improve the task performance and, through this, the achievement of the goals of the organization.""This article presents follow-up information to a previous publication regarding ways to increase emphasis on research skills in undergraduate Technical Communication curricula. We detail the ways our undergraduate program highlights research by requiring majors to complete senior thesis projects that culminate in submission to an online peer-reviewed journal housed at our institution.

Thirty-four writers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The experimental group received 2 hours of training in the use of concept mapping. Both groups revised the same chapter from a computer manual, and an experienced technical editor blindly evaluated each revision. In part two of the study, revised texts were given to two groups of users. One group received a concept-mapped revision, while the other group received a text revised by a writer who had used conventional revision techniques. Readers' comprehension was tested and compared. Revision time was not significantly different between groups, and the editor's ratings of quality were not different. However, readers' comprehension was significantly higher with the concept-mapped versions. These results suggest that concept mapping is a useful revision tool for writers.""Presents the results of research on screen captures in software user documentation Shows that users benefit from screen captures that support switching attention, developing a mental model, identifying and locating objects, and verifying screen states""A recent study showed that Web-based materials enhanced teaching and learning in an introductory operations management course. Evidence gained from the study provides the basis for several guidelines concerning the early stages of implementing such a course. Faculty should understand why students visit the Website, time the availability of materials to match usage patterns, and provide information in appropriate detail and in an appropriate format. The Website facilitated students' note taking and studying, enhanced class discussion, and aided retention; it did not encourage students to miss class, as some faculty feared. Students tended to print out materials from the site, so that printing costs for courses were not reduced, just transferred from an academic department to the computer lab or the students. While traditional ""chalk and talk"" approaches will continue in the short term, students will increasingly see such an approach as outdated and find the Web their instructional medium of choice.""When students are also corporate employees, unique ethical and legal problems can arise in a technical communication classroom.

As we enter the 1980s, it will be beneficial for organizational communicators to identify what employees want to know. Reviewing the trend line of the 1970s and projecting it into the 1980s helps to predict the employee communication needs for the 80s. It is relatively simple to cite what employees want to know-the major question is, will the employer-communicator get the message!. © 1981, Sage Publications.

Specifically, we had two aims: (a) to determine employee perceptions of the impact of eight dimensions of communication satisfaction on productivity, and (b) to understand how the type of organization may moderate the link between communica tion and productivity. Two businesses, representative of service and manufacturing or ganizations, were investigated by administering the Communication Satisfaction Questionnaire and interviewing all employees. The results showed that communica tion was perceived to have an impact on productivity that varied in both kind and magnitude. Moreover, a number of intriguing differences emerged between these two companies. The findings suggest that the link between communication and produc tivity is more complex than previously assumed. © 1993, Sage Publications.

Employees of a large organization were invited to respond to a paper survey as well as an identical electronic survey. Results from 134 employees who completed both questionnaires indicated that electronic surveys were seen as marginally easier to use and more enjoyable than paper surveys. However, the paper-based questionnaires produced a higher response rate. The self-reported likelihood that participants would respond to similar questionnaires in the future did not differ between the two formats. After comparing the answers on survey items that measured feelings of well-being and spending patterns, data quality also appeared to be equivalent across the two formats. Conceptual issues, as well as the implications for managers who are administering employee surveys, are discussed. © 2010 IEEE.""This article presents findings of a 2014 survey of 72 U.S. employers asking: Which oral communication skills are most utilized daily by new hires?

Employers still widely prefer the standard chronological résumé, with only 3% desiring a scannable résumé. The vast majority of employers prefer electronic delivery, either by email (46%) or at the company's Web site (38%), with only 7% preferring a paper copy. Cover letters are preferred by a majority (56%). Preferences regarding résumé style and cover letters were independent of national (USA) vs. multinational geographic range, company size, type of industry, or respondent's job function.

The employees scored their attitudes regarding motivation, ability, safety climate, and safety performance.Purpose: One of the major challenges for modern organizations is to create healthy and safe work environments, as evidenced by the number of occupational deaths (worldwide: four per minute), and an even higher number of injuries. This study explores different levels of motivation and ability, to identify which are most relevant for safety climate and safety performance. This study aims to pinpoint the areas information designers should focus on to most effectively contribute to healthy and safe work environments.Results: The results confirmed the expected relationship between safety climate and safety performance. Of the explored sublevels of motivation and ability, personal motivation and external ability proved most relevant for creating a healthy safety climate and healthy safety performance.Conclusion: In the design of safety instructions, focusing on personal motivation and external ability seems a promising strategy for contributing to healthy and safe work environments, especially in high-risk environments. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

To illustrate, we report a subset of findings regarding how technical and professional communication supports successful humanitarian work. Method: We conducted a three-phase longitudinal study of an international humanitarian organization. In Phases 1 and 2, we conducted phone/Skype interviews with 25 practitioners, a group including international, regional, national, and local levels of the organization. In Phase 3, we engaged in ethnographic observation of work practices in six countries and conducted a total of 95 additional interviews (in person) with humanitarian practitioners. Results: Communication plays an important role in the success of practitioners’ day-to-day work when that communication pursues goals relevant to humanitarian culture, such as showing respect for local ways of operating. Specifically, our findings show that enacting humanitarian culture led practitioners to (a) localize how they speak, (b) collaboratively produce written documents, and (c) encourage bottom-up organizational communication. Conclusion: We found that while many of our field’s skills and areas of expertise carried over to humanitarian environments, the values and motivations associated with humanitarian culture are what influenced the effective application of these skills and are, therefore, key to the effectiveness of communication. In particular, finegrained localization and empowerment at the lowest level are central to professional communication that supports successful humanitarian work. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

This paper concerns why graphics function the way they do rather than cataloguing instances in which when they are useful. Topics addressed include the basic constitution of a graphic item, the sequence in which the mind processes those items, the strategies people use to encode and remember information in graphics, the conjoint encoding of verbal and visual forms, and the encoding of clusters of items and their labels. The paper offers several recommendations for effectively representing quantitative information in graphic form. © 1990 IEEE""The relationship between industry and government is being increasingly threatened by untrained individuals who offer unfounded opinions on controversial public issues. Legitimate scientists and engineers meanwhile have maintained their traditionally aloof roles, leaving the public without real expert information to answer its concerns. To reestablish their credibility, the legitimate experts should heed these recommendations: (1) Take the initiative on public technological issues rather than waiting to react to government action or public demand; (2) support harsh penalties for managers of technology who knowingly conceal worker or consumer dangers; (3) step into the political arena to work for regulatory reform and encourage result-oriented laws; and (4) seek opportunities to communicate accurate technical information and to be accessible to the public.""Encylclopedic storage is a method of storing knowledge that avoids unnecessary duplication and provides convenient access to the stored materials. This paper discusses a particular approach to such storage, the motivation for which is developed by considering first some of the basic properties of the process of knowledge transfer via the written record, leading to the development of a unit of knowledge. In terms of this unit, the ″size″ of scientific and technical knowledge, and of electrical engineering knowledge, is estimated. This unit also becomes the basic building block for the proposed encyclopedic system. A very small experimental version of such a system is now in existence.""In the fall of 1972, the Department of Humanities of the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan adopted a lecture-recitation format for its required course in scientific and technical communication.

These are called ″synoptic declension″ and ″electronic expansion.″ Detailed variations proposed under these headings are examined and compared with the proven advantages of the engineering transactions. It is concluded that there is no viable alternative in the English-speaking world to the engineering transactions. However, certain areas where the transactions could be improved are pointed out. Reference is made to the present plight of the engineering journal, by which is meant the journal that passes across the engineer's desk and is read, not the periodical that goes straight on to the shelves for reference. It is concluded that industry must recognize its overall interest in the future of the engineering journal and take steps to ensure its continued viability.""Linguistic research has given us new strategies for improving stylistic efficiency. These strategies, in contrast to the myriad of advice on how to improve sentence style, create sentence flow and give the prose a character that propels readers along.

The findings show that, in the 21st century, English has become an indispensable ""must"" in the company and that there is a general understanding that staff at all levels develop their language skills as they see appropriate for their roles within the company. What needs to be learned, however, is not English as a native language but communicative effectiveness in English as a business lingua franca, which-as an international contact language-brings together nonnative as well as native Englishes from various linguacultural backgrounds spoken with varying degrees of proficiency. Learning to cope with the challenges of such diversity, in the context of business communication, seems to happen most effectively in business ""communities of practice"" rather than in traditional English training. The study also shows that, despite the dominance of English, other languages are not disappearing from the scene but are, indeed, used as a pragmatic or strategic resource. In particular, German, as the headquarters' language, maintains an important role among individuals and within the organization. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Professionals in Taiwan’s high-technology industries use English frequently in their work, and their need for increased English communication skills is growing. This paper presents the results of a survey of 1001 professionals in Taiwan’s high-technology industries. The survey describes how these professionals use English communication skills in their work. The data should help Taiwanese universities and industries design new or modify existing English communication skills courses. The survey also offers a specific example from which may be drawn general appraisals of the extent to which English has become an “international language” in the high-technology industries. © 1991 IEEE""Traditional courses and course-books for teaching English as a foreign language are often too general and grammer-orientated for students of technology from overseas. The students are well motivated for learning how to communicate effectively within their technical contexts. To harness their enthusiasm, courses on communications skills need to emphasize functions as well as forms of language.""English for Specific Purposes (ESP) is English language instruction designed to meet the specific learning needs of a specific learner or group of learners within a specific time frame for which instruction in general English will not suffice. According to Dudley-Evans and St. John, the key activities in ESP are as follows: needs analysis, course design, materials selection, teaching and learning, and evaluation. It is emphasized that particular attention be given to the first activity since this governs all subsequent activities and thereby distinguishes the work of ESP most clearly from English for General Purposes (EGP).""Studies have demonstrated frequent use of English in international advertising, but little is known about people's preference for English versus local languages. This article empirically investigated the difficulty of the English language as a possible determinant of people's preference for English or the local language. In an experiment, Dutch participants judged a number of car ads with English slogans that were pretested as easy or difficult to understand. They were subsequently asked to express a preference for either the English slogan or the Dutch equivalent. Results showed that easy-to-understand English slogans were appreciated better than difficult-to-understand English slogans. Moreover, the degree of difficulty in comprehension of the English slogans affected participants' preference for English. English was preferred to Dutch when it was easy to understand; when it was difficult to understand, English was appreciated as much as the Dutch equivalent. In conclusion, the experiment provides empirical support for the role of comprehension in the preference for and appreciation of English in international advertising. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""There are two opposing views towards technical writing courses and towards teachers of technical writing: one favorable, the other disdainful. Those who disdain technical writing seem to believe that it: 1) imposes restrictive and arbitrary forms upon creative individuals, 2) involves only the accumulation of factual evidence, 3) deals with things, rather than with people, and 4) is, like other practical arts, a second-class activity. The first three beliefs are mistaken, and it can be argued that the dissemination of technical and scientific information is just as humanistic as artistic writing.""Group Decision Support Systems are helping many orga nizations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of group meetings.

Specifically, it is recommended that those who train workers of Mexican descent (a) emphasize considerate behavior, (b) use encouragement techniques, (c) avoid public confrontation, (d) maintain a respectful distance with trainees, (e) foster participation, (f) offer collaborative team projects, (g) inspire ongoing education, (h) formally recog nize program completion, (i) allow ample time for topic coverage, (j) be sensitive to the status of women, (k) avoid blaming students for training failures, (l) settle conflicts amicably, and (m) provide guidance and structure for the participants. Since productive organizations must assume the responsibility for training employees when the prepara tory education system fails, implications for universities serving Mexican-American populations are also offered. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Business instructors may discover, however, a pedagogical bonus: more communication with their students outside the classroom. We studied the perceptions and practices of 138 students in business communications at one of the historically black colleges and universities who used e-mail and the Internet to complete assignments. The results indicate that CMC encouraged students to become active learners and to contact instructors. Anecdotal evi dence suggests that e-mail helps African-American students to see instructors as facilitators, though it does not necessarily become a rhetorical “safe house,” where students engage in vernacular discourse. Nevertheless, e-mail fosters an informal rhetorical relationship that rewards openness and collaboration among students and instructors within the formal academic setting. © 1998, Sage Publications.

Computer-mediated communication is different in many ways from traditional face-to-face communication, perhaps most significantly because the communication is usually asynchronous instead of synchronous. Temporal independence of communication changes the patterns of work, decision making, and understandings about the work and the relationships between the individuals involved in the work. As a consequence, managing virtual teams is different and more complex than managing face-to-face teams, yet virtual teams are still groups of individuals that share most of the characteristics and dynamics found on traditional teams. The effective management of virtual teams requires knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles of team dynamics regardless of the time, space, and communication differences between virtual and face-to-face work environments. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The project management of virtual teams differs from that of traditional ones. Traditional project risks, such as complexity, the uncertainty of factors influencing the project, and the high interdependency of project tasks must be managed alongside changed temporal, geographic, and cultural dimensions. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of critical technological issues, such as wrong tool selection or limited internet access on performance as well as team and team member satisfaction in virtual work settings. Research questions: How do critical technology-related issues concerning the selection and use of web-based tools influence the performance and satisfaction of virtual project teams? Literature review: Instead of categorizing virtual teams as a type of team that contrasts with traditional or face-to-face teams, the focus has shifted to virtualness as a characteristic present in all teams. Project teamwork is often integrated in university degree programs in order to prepare students appropriately for real-life projects. While these student teams are often not geographically spread across countries, they have a high degree of virtualness because of their diverse team composition, the necessity for working at different places, and the limited face-to-face meeting opportunities. Performance, effectiveness, and satisfaction are central issues in the evaluation and measurement of project teams: Team performance is often evaluated on the basis of acceptance of a specified output by a customer. Through specific mediating processes, team performance can alternatively be assessed by inquiring the team's perception on their performance. Effectiveness can be defined as the achievement of clear goals and objectives and it is often related to the team's performance. Finally, satisfaction can be defined as having three dimensions - satisfaction with the team, the satisfaction of meeting customer needs, and general satisfaction with extrinsic rewards and work. Technology use is substantial for distributed teamwork and can be assessed by the extent to which it supports communication, collaboration, and project-management tasks. Methodology: Fifteen teams were observed and interviewed over a two-year period. The resulting data were analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach, which revealed how the selection and use of tools for communication, collaboration, and project management in the different project activities influenced the team's performance. Results and conclusions: Our results contribute to practice by providing a number of guidelines for the management of virtual teams as well as knowledge required by companies wishing to launch projects with virtual teams. Differing performances of teams can, in many cases, be attributed to such conditions as: internet availability and bandwidth; lack of training for certain tools; the selection and appropriate use of tools; integrated tool support for task management; as well as the promotion of transparency about progress made. It was found that restrictions in internet access of even a single member within a team limited the team's technological choices, which affected the team's performance. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""A monthly bulletin of engineering and management information has been designed to enhance the flow of technical communications across organizational, geographical, and discipline boundaries in a large, technically oriented, multidivisional corporation.

Proposal evaluators, both experts and nonexperts, react to technical accuracy as well as subjective elements in the proposal document itself. This study of word usage identified a lexicon that reflected “enthusiasm” in proposals, then analyzed 1000-word samples of text for the presence of this vocabulary. Testing this method on government Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and business salesmanship texts determined a range of values for an Enthusiasm Index (EI). Subsequent analysis of fifteen technical proposals as a group revealed no significant difference between the RFPs and the proposals themselves. However, a breakdown by subject yielded a significant difference between those from social science/humanities versus those from science/engineering. The successful proposals contained occurrences of enthusiastic lexicon, but the method only examined this one indicator of enthusiasm. Although the results of this study provide no substantive basis to conclude that enthusiastic proposals are also more successful, the method of lexical analysis described was useful and could apply to other types of linguistic analysis. © 1990 IEEE""We can write more effective technical reports, give more convincing speeches, and create more persuasive sales materials and proposals if we recognize the enthymeme, most simply defined as a syllogism with a suppressed major premise. Using the enthymeme in persuasion reminds us to offer our audience a reason for every assertion we make, say the author, helps us clarify our logic and state clearly our maina nd supporting assertions, and encourages the reader to participate in our argument by supplying the hidden assumptions in those enthymemes.

It first details the history of the concept of entropy and its application to information theory focusing closely on Claude Shannon's work. It next details the refinements of the concept made by those which have some relation to business communications including Cloze procedure and Clozentropy, as well as discussions of the concept in business communications texts. The paper closes with potential applications of the entropy concept in business communication courses including its use as a general theoretical basis as well as specific uses as a tool in a variety of instructional areas. © 1984, Sage Publications.

This article reviews the evolution of the term and comes to the conclusion that as an information theory concept “entropy of information” has two faces. We need order and predict ability (low entropy) to a certain degree for ease of understanding and assimilation, but past that point very little information is exchanged. Some degree of randomizing or presenting a message in an unexpected manner will increase entropy or unpredictability of the message, but can also amplify its impact upon the receiver. © 1977, Sage Publications.

Organizational Web sites must typically appeal to multiple audiences, a condition that often results in different discourses being juxtaposed within the same interface. To analyze and explain the effects of such juxtapositions, this article adapts to the Web the principles that Bakhtin developed to conceptualize discursive diversity in the novel, in particular his concept of dialogism. To illustrate their efficacy, the article applies these principles to analyze a pair of government Web sites about forests, the forest industry, and the environment. Whereas the homepages of the two sites project divergent approaches to the discourses of their diverse audiences, a dialogic analysis of the new site's deeper levels reveals how the government's discursive strategy appears to favor one audience at the expense of others. Drawing on this case study, this article discusses how an approach informed by Bakhtin's principles can illuminate our analysis of organizational Web discourse. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""At Emory University's Goizueta Business School, eportfolio serves as the foundation for a sequence of assignments in our core ""Communication and Professional Development"" course. Our philosophy underlying the use of eportfolio is influenced by narrative and sense-making theory. At the beginning of the semester, students record their experiences and accomplishments on eportfolio. We then guide students to identify the narrative themes running through their experiences, and to use those themes to develop personal brand statements, stories that demonstrate their strengths and values in action, and professional development plans. This sequence of assignments allows students to imagine, construct, and articulate a professional identity through narrative. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Authentic reflections are critical components of strong portfolios, and students often struggle with this important task.

Ideally, they can be used as online profiles in the job application process, allowing more authenticity, personalization, and completeness than traditional résumés. In our colleges, eportfolios help students reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and form goals for professional development. Overall, however, our students' eportfolios lack the professional touch of their résumés. We believe extensive coordination within a college is required to help business students create eportfolios that they can use to market themselves for professional positions. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Use of eportfolios for business communication students in an advanced two-quarter capstone brought an unexpected networking opportunity, in addition to their conventional use as a showcase for student writing and research.

Then, through use of a course website providing an optional link to those eportfolios, students were able to use portfolios to jumpstart conversations among other students and business communication alumni. The instructor has required both print and digital portfolios since 2006 and explains why both types of portfolios are useful, especially to enhance professional networking. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The technical communicator must be a 'human engineer' because a communication, like a computer system, can be a technical success but a practical failure if its design discourages its use. Four parallels between technical communication are discussed: (1) Its overall structure should be apparent to the user: (2) it should be congenial without being chatty or too personal; (3) its nomenclature and syntax must be consistent throughout all functions; and (4) its logic must not trap users in loops but should lead them straight to their goals.""Technical writers write user documentation for some kind. However, they also have skills that might enable them to also serve as user-advocates on product development teams and testers of prototype systems. Developers start with perhaps a list of specifications and their original theories of what the product should be. It is likely that developers original hypotheses contain errors. It would be highly user for developers if they had people on their team who have plenty of prior experience minimizing the likelihood of error by suggesting various kinds of experimental tasks. This always have been the main business of an effective technical writer.""Correction of errors is a major part of the editor's task.

The relationship of a written work to each of these poles may help an author decide crucial questions regarding the selection and organization of data (the mainstay of the pure report) and the development and proper emphasis of ideas (the mainstay of the pure essay). This model can also show the relationship of technical writing to journalism and to writing in the humanities. Moreover, it can provide a simplified discourse theory to be used in planning and teaching courses that complement, rather than conflict with, each other.""Presents an annotated list of 115 essential works on technical communication compiled from a list of over 600 titles from a wide variety of print, Internet, and professional sources Constitutes what might be called ""essential literacy"" in technical communication""The National Council of Teachers of English contest the trend toward basics and minimums in education and identifies the ways that the study of English contributes to knowledge, understanding, and skills.

The usefulness and increasing popularity of the Web is based on how well individuals and organizations use the technology as a means of establishing an online ethos. Technical communicators are already familiar with the obvious goal of establishing a professional ethos, but they might also consider some techniques for establishing sites having a more diverse and communal ethos. This ethos is expressed in ""special interest"" Web sites constructed by individuals, and several commercially oriented organizations have also successfully incorporated this ethos into their sites."Presents a framework--grounded in the classic rhetorical concept of ethos--for examining the Web and its audiences Argues that the usefulness and popularity of the Web depends on how well technology is used to establish an online ethos"In the educational arena, virtual teams made up of students who are located in more than one country are becoming increasingly commonplace. However, studies of the technological, social, and organizational factors that contribute to the success of these global virtual student teams (GVSTs) have yet to be systematically identified and discussed. In this paper, we seek to address this gap in our knowledge, drawing on several years of experience with GVSTs and addressing the following research question: How can university instructors establish effective GVST projects? Situating the case: The cases that we explore in this paper involve GVSTs with team members located variously in Hong Kong (all four cases), the USA (two cases), the UK (one case), and Singapore (one case). Students are a mix of undergraduate and graduate. How the case was studied: Our pedagogical purpose for running the GVST projects was to expose students to international communication and negotiation practices. The case designs involved situations where the student team members had to work collaboratively on a variety of tasks. We collected observational data and survey data, and required the team members to submit individual reflective reports about their learning experiences. About the case: We examine cultural differences among teams. We also note how issues of time and space vary across these teams, and consider how sufficient trust may be developed between team members to ensure productive work. Conclusion: From the four cases, we elicit 10 pertinent operational factors that should be of value to educators planning GVST projects. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Assessing the vocabulary range of the audience for an engineering document is not an easy task and is even more difficult when the audience includes disadvantaged readers. This report supports the hypothesis that the less often a word appears in print, the less likely it is to be known by a reader. A test was given to 277 hearing students ranging in age from 9 through 14 and to 438 hearing-impaired students ranging in age from 10 to 19, including the special case of college freshmen. Results showed that prelingually deaf students trailed far behind their hearing peers; e. g. , hearing subjects knew 63% of the words up to the 24,000th word, while hearing-impaired subjects knew only 62% of the words up to the 2000th word.""Examines ethical issues in intercultural communication, focusing on privacy, legality, teamwork, social responsibility, and cultural sensitivity Offers specific suggestions for avoiding stereotyping, tokenism, and ethnocentrism Concludes with guidelines for technical communicators and suggestions for managers.""Technological advances have enabled dramatic change in organizational design and communication as expressed through such actions as corporate downsizing and increased telecommuting. Technology fosters these changes because computers and telecommunication technology minimize the impact of time and place on organizational communication. However, with new technology channels for communication come new challenges to the ethical standards for social conduct. Many times, employees and other individual members of the electronic communications community do not use technology in the manner that its developers envisioned. In this paper, we explore ethical issues heightened by the use of technology as well as examining some of the means for managing these ethical concerns. We advance the argument that ethical problems are not inherent in technological advances. Instead, it is how human beings choose to use, appropriate, and interact with one another by incorporating these new tools that may lead to ethical dilemmas in business contexts. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""Discussions in ethical theory literature attempt to present the diversity of ethical opinions. However, discussions of teleology, deontology, and ethical pluralism present no organic base for the study of business ethics.

Because lan guage is the means for conveying values, including ethical values, business com munication faculty play an important role in deciding what should be taught, and how. But until very recently, most researchers failed to look specifically at actual practices and perceptions in the workplace. To address that need, we conducted a survey of 250 business leaders concerning their ethical preferences and compared our results with an earlier study of business faculty and students. The survey, adapted from one used in the Arthur Andersen Business Ethics Program, consists of 20 narratives which presented respondents with the need to judge the impor tance of certain issues and their approval or disapproval of the action or decision described. We found no significant differences in responses to the 14 items which addressed ethical issues in such areas as creating health and environmental risks, taking credit when credit is not due, focusing on disability issues, deceiving cus tomers with products and services, and using insider information to gain personal advantage. We did find significant differences in responses to six narratives focused on ignoring wrongdoing in the workplace, doing special favors for others to gain personal advantage, and covering up flaws in merchandise or operations. Our results, and the survey instrument itself, provide useful tools for the business com munication classroom. © 2000, Sage Publications.

In recent years STC has increased its effort to generate a greater awareness and understanding of the ethical dimension of the profession. This article is intended to contribute to that effort. To clarify the nature of ethical problems, we first distinguish between the ethical perspective and several other perspectives. We then discuss three types of ethical principles. Together these principles make up a conceptural framework that will help illuminate almost any ethical problem. Finally, we demonstrate the application of these principles using hypothetical case studies.""Work force demographics are driving inevitable changes in the workplace. Two seemingly unrelated forces, work force diversity and business ethics, are impacting organizations as never before. the resulting dilemmas are challenging both business decision makers and employees. the ability of corporations to assimilate “others” into today’s work force and provide opportunities for them to realize their career expectations may also challenge the integrity of a corporation’s code of ethics. Mixed messages threaten not only the integrity of the codes of ethics, but the trust and consequent compliance that can be expected of employees. This paper proposes to set forth the interrelatedness of ethics and diversity and to demonstrate how their proper and effective application can and will advance employee growth and satisfaction while improving production and profits for corporations across the country. © 1992 IEEE.""In response to ongoing concerns about financial ethics, this study analyzes the speech of company executives in quarterly earnings conference calls to understand strategic usage of ethics-related language. Against the backdrop of the recent global financial crisis, the Aristotelian concept of ethos provides a framework to investigate linguistic features that express ethical stance. Text analysis software was used to produce frequency profiles of features that were then further interpreted qualitatively. Results showed that the executives used a variety of more or less explicit terms to maintain a strong focus on trustworthiness and commitment to moving forward. The findings can inform the development of teaching materials that help learners become more effective communicators in the context of IT-mediated financial reporting. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The subject of ethics in graphic design has been only lightly treated in the literature regarding issues in technical communication.

In this essay I describe and contrast several foundational and nonfoundational ethical approaches. Analyzing two well-known ethics cases from the perspective of the different approaches, I argue that although foundational approaches are limited, they provide better insights than do nonfoundational approaches. Finally, I describe a problem-solving technique, based on foundational approaches and communicative ethics, that can be used by technical communication students and professionals to analyze ethical dilemmas.""Ethics as a topic in technical communication has grown in interest in the past quarter century as the field itself has matured. We now understand technical communication as involved in communicating not only technical information but also values, ethics, and tacit assumptions represented in goals. It also is involved in accommodating the values and ethics of its many audiences. This understanding is linked to an awareness of the social nature of all discourse and the root interconnectedness of rhetoric and ethics.

Such campaigns can be conducted from several models, but these can be broadly grouped into monological and dialogical approaches. In an information society such campaigns increasingly provide the point of contact between an organization and its publics. As a result, these campaigns constitute the primary input with which publics make assessments about both the ethicality of the organization's communication and the ethicality of the organization itself. Using the example of public relations, this article describes the increasingly important distinction between monologic and dialogic campaigns, explains why the currently dominant monological approach to public relations has long been recognized by practitioners and scholars to be ethically perilous, suggests an ethically more viable dialogic approach, and concludes by discussing some of the reasons the business community has been slow to adopt such an approach and why its ethical and practical benefits outweigh these objections. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper surveys treatments of business communication ethics in Association for Business Communication (ABC) Publications for the last 30 years. Pedagogical papers reveal an almost unanimous opinion that business communication is inherently a moral subject and that ethics has a place in the classroom. Consensus on how to teach or to evaluate moral behavior has not, however, been achieved. Nonpedagogical papers have usually been conceptual or descriptive, and have rarely been part of program matic research. Consequently a unified body of knowledge that could guide future re search or provide a basis for moral instruction does not exist. Future research in both pedagogical and nonpedagogical areas is recommended. © 1990, Sage Publications.

This paper suggests a method for modeling the characters of writers, readers, and sponsoring organizations as they are shaped in the process of writing about public policy issues. The model is then used to examine the classroom oral presentations of four professionals who were involved in different ways with the same controversial public policy issue. The goal is to integrate classroom consider- ations of the writing process and of audience analysis, of personal and professional ethics, and of relevant workplace controversies.

Teachers can prepare fu ture professional communicators to consider the ethical dimension of their writing activities by using Lawrence Kohlberg's hierarchy of moral develop ment. When Kohlberg's hierarchy is applied to fictional business settings, stu dents have the opportunity to investigate the relationship between action morality and agent morality. This type of investigation is an essential part of teaching professional communication because the written language used in business transmits values. © 1989, Sage Publications.

The first, emphasizing statistical validity, privileges the research community by recommending that the ethnographer’s data analysis via coding agree with that of other raters from the research community. The second asserts that the ethnographer who comes closest to validity comes closest to presenting only the subject’s point of view. Ethnography, however, comprises four essential, overlapping contexts: the phenomenal context (that which is observed/recorded), the site’s cultural context (the subjects’ outlook), the research community context, and the researcher’s interior context, shaped by experience and education. Each of the four vantages has dominating tendencies, but if one does dominate to the exclusion of others, the reductive result is data-centered, thin description; subjects-centered groupthink; research community-centered groupthink; or researchercentered solipsism. Although all contexts of meaning are important, none should fully eclipse the others. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Eclipse Aviation's corporate transformation from a spin-off company to a convergence-of-innovation company hinged on modifying an early marketing strategy. To overcome the loss of the jet engine, employees had to radically modify earlier expert representations and adopt rhetorical appeals that more closely parallel what Miller described as ""cyborg discourse."" To understand how Eclipse Aviation survived the typically fatal loss of a stated primary innovation and to explore the implications that this particular start-up's rupture has for technology transfer and technical marketing, this study centers its analysis on a Web site that marketers used to ""ventilate"" the company and prevent financial collapse. The transformation in the company's marketing strategy illustrates how cyborg ethos appeals aggregate and discipline distributed stakeholder roles. © 2008 Sage Publications.""A study of writing in the United States Navy indicates the wide usefulness of the rhetorical concept of ethos. Although almost never formally taught, the concept is continually being rediscovered and applied within a wide variety of naval contexts, from naval personnel evaluations to shiprepair reports.

And, as the Tailhook episode has recently demonstrated, a lack of such understanding can sometimes have adverse effects on the credibility of the Navy as a whole. © 1995, Sage Publications.

This concept translates from the Greek as “character,” but that English word does not convey the concept's richness. Nor does Latin persona, a term sometimes used to describe the narrative voice in technical prose. Ethos is the root of “ethics,” which tends to objectify values and choices, alienating them from the people making them. In this paper, I suggest that an understanding of ethos in all its richness can help writers of technical prose to produce work that, in relation to traditionally “objective” prose, is both more readable and more ethical. © 1995 IEEE.""This paper takes the European media revolution as its starting point and traces the history of the European Community’s first major legislation on audiovisual internationalization and deregulation—the “television without frontiers” directive on broadcasting. Specifically, this paper characterizes the aims of the European Community’s audiovisual policy as tenuously resolving two conflicting models of broadcast regulation—the trusteeship model and the marketplace model. An evaluation of the “television without frontiers” directive on broadcasting highlights the politics of compromise at play in the EC’s regulation of its audiovisual sector. © 1993 IEEE""Effective user documentation is legible, well illustrated, clearly indexed, and written with the user's needs in mind. Evaluating software documentation before buying helps determine the true cost of installation. This evaluation should cover both communicative and technical quality.""This case study examines how users of varied experience levels interact with an open-access content-management system (CMS) that lacks managed leadership. In particular, this case study compared how experienced and new users performed at a variety of tasks in a nonprofit community wiki to evaluate skill acquisition and possible skill loss. Research questions: (1) Do experienced users make more use of CMS features (templates, tags, hyperlinks) than new users, even without instruction? (2) Where do experienced and new users differ in successful task completion in the wiki? Situating the case: A number of content-management evaluations have utilized usability as a key method for evaluating user experience. In addition, Wikipedia has been a frequent target of investigation. This study looks to expand the crowdsourced wikis evaluated in this manner. Methodology: This case study started with a series of interviews to determine how users expected to use the community wiki. After the interviews, 10 users (5 new and 5 experienced) were evaluated for this study, each performing 6 tasks. About the case: This study looked at the initial installation of a local community wiki system. The system is a CMS designed for use by municipal territories to create crowdsourced wikis capable of preserving knowledge that would not traditionally fit in Wikipedia entries. Conclusions: Users who maintained sufficient interest in the wiki to become experienced wiki users developed a number of core skills even without organizational support, though new users demonstrated a steep skill deficit. However, new users actually demonstrated a greater capacity to highlight incompleteness of information within the wiki than experienced users in one key task. © 2016 IEEE.""Performance appraisal evaluation has focused on psychometric refinements. This paper proposes an alternative method of evaluation by concentrating on the dimensions on the appraisal instrument. These dimensions are compared with organization members’ constructs for productive behavior. To the extent that the constructs and the dimensions are similar, the system will be more effective in evaluating productive be havior. Implications for the evaluation of performance appraisal systems are discussed. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Most such formulas depend upon the assumptions that longer words and longer sentences are more difficult than those which are not. The author asserts that these assumptions do not hold, and that there are other factors which contribute to relative difficulty when dealing with nonfluent readers. Vocabulary, sentence structure, text organization, and presentation, factors affecting readability that can be controlled by the writer, are discussed.""To create texts that meet the needs of audiences, writers must be able to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the texts they produce. Over the last 60 years, a variety of text-evaluation methods have been developed and writers can now choose among many alternative methods. This paper begins by isolating some of the persistent questions raised by people in education, business, and government who want to judge how well their texts are working. It then compares the cognitive processes involved in “reading to comprehend text” with those involved in “reading to evaluate and revise text,” stressing that even experienced writers often need help in detecting and diagnosing text problems. The paper then characterizes three general classes of tests for evaluating text quality: (1) text-focused, (2) expert-judgment-focused, and (3) reader-focused approaches. It reviews typical methods within each class-examining the strengths and limitations of particular tests-and discusses the relative advantages of reader-focused methods over other approaches. © 1989 IEEE""The design of interactive applications for online communication is an ongoing area of research within technical communication. This study reports on the development of an interactive sea-level rise (SLR) viewer, a data visualization tool that communicates about the potential effects of SLR along coastlines. It describes the formative evaluation of a location-specific SLR viewer created via integral stakeholder engagement. Participants performed a series of tasks, answered questions about the tool's usability and communicative effectiveness, and made suggestions for ways to improve its application to desired tasks. The authors discuss the implications of this study for visual risk communication and make recommendations for others developing similar interactive data visualization tools with audience input. © The Author(s) 2015""Currently, colleges and universities have developed assessment systems that can collect student work products for evaluation in an effort to make student learning transparent and ensure accountability in higher education. At the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, we have developed a digital portfolio system, the RosE Portfolio System (REPS), that allows for efficient data collection; the results of portfolio evaluations are used by academic departments and programs to improve curricula and provide evidence to external accrediting agencies. The results of evaluations of student performance are also used to ensure the quality of academic curricula. © 2006 IEEE.""This is an expanded version of an evaluation originally given at the International Technical Communication Conference, Washington, D. C. , 1976. The questionnaire was an attempt to get in touch with as many graduates of Rensselaer's Master's Program in Technical Communication as possible and to find out their reactions to the curriculum. The questions covered such topics as present and past occupations, usefulness of the Rensselaer curriculum, recommended curriculum changes, making use of invited speakers, degree of emphasis on style and format, supplementary courses, contact with professional writers, and adoption of new techniques.""This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a soft skills employee training program. We examined willingness to learn and delivery methods (face-to-face vs. online) and their associations with the training outcomes in terms of learning and behavioral change. Results showed that neither participants’ willingness to learn nor delivery methods affected comprehension. However, both variables had significant effects on the reported behavioral change. This training is effective in teaching employees how to “flex” their personal styles and to improve their relationships with each other. Implications for business and professional communication training and directions for future research are discussed in detail. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav."Questions the assumption that usability methods are equally suitable for evaluating Web sites and Web applications Concludes that the decision to choose one variant of the think-aloud method over another should be based on practical considerations."Evaluation is an important aspect of any program, and a systematic evalua tion design may become the ally of instructors and students alike. This article describes a research project that measures student growth in written business communication. Senior level management students participated in a modified in-basket writing exercise; the results revealed that instruction in business communication theory and analysis of models significantly improved written communication. Since the improvement is measured in a quantifiable way, most of the students were rewarded for their writing with improved scores, thus reinforcing a positive attitude toward their business communication skills. © 1980, Sage Publications.

This study investigates the factors that determine user satisfaction with helpdesks and helplines. A survey, based on the SERVQUAL framework and questionnaire, shows that the SERVQUAL dimensions of customer satisfaction are not applicable in these contexts. Three quality dimensions were found instead: solution quality, the experience of the consultation, and, in the case of a physical environment, the so-called tangibles. Helpdesk customers base their overall quality perceptions mainly on their experiences during a consultation, while helpline customers focus strongly on the quality of the solution offered. The study also found a connection between the perceived helpline quality and the appreciation of the primary service. © 2007 IEEE.""This article uses research in cultural-historic activity theory, exploring patients' use of technical health care texts to produce knowledge and design their choices related to their bodies and health.

Based on the example of the evolution of typography following the invention of the printing press, it is hypothesized that homepages of 2006 will be more homogenous with each other than the earlier samples and will thus exhibit the development of standardization. The study finds increased standardization in the 2006 homepages in the categories of homepage length, primary navigation orientation, primary navigation style, focal point, and search engine presence and location. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""Salient examples may bias human judgments about the probability or frequency of events, an effect known as the “availability heuristic” or the “salience bias.” Scientific work has not been immune to this bias; in particular, the existence of certain large-scale trends in evolution, such as those in size, complexity, and fitness, is widely accepted among professionals within evolutionary biology and paleontology, as well as among people outside these fields, even though these trends are poorly documented. Often, what documentation exists consists mainly of long lists of cases exemplifying the trend, or detailed descriptions of a small number of salient cases. Here, it is argued that although these lists and salient cases are not good evidence that a trend is pervasive, they may convince both the trend researcher and his or her audience. The possibility is raised that the bias may be pervasive in science and everyday thought, and a strategy for avoiding it, namely the use of random samples, is offered. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

When such examinations are used one at a time as needed, they will help individuals to separate content from mechanics of presentation and to distinguish scientific evidence from erroneous speculation. They will also help authors, reviewers, and editors to judge objectively the scientific worthiness of the paper, to improve the literary presentation, and to elevate the quality of effective medical/scientific communications.""Traceability - the ability of developers to describe and follow the life of an artifact throughout the software development life cycle-is an important process that facilitates acquisition and use of process knowledge. While there has been extensive research focusing on the development of traceability solutions, there is a paucity of research that characterizes the tasks that need to be performed in implementing and using traceability. This research addresses this gap by conceptualizing traceability practice in software development as comprising information processing and communication among developers involved in the process. Accordingly, we present the results of two complementary studies focusing on these two aspects of traceability. Based on Study 1, we develop a process model for information processing in traceability. Through Study 2, we identify important contingency factors that impact the mode of communication among developers and customers. We argue that choice of communication media should be dictated by matching particular media characteristics such as synchronicity, reprocessability, and channel capacity to the situation at hand rather than by using aggregated measures such as media richness or social presence. We integrate the findings from our two studies into a process model that prescribes guidelines for traceability practice in software development. Our prescriptions also help traceability tool developers in delivering traceability support that facilitates appropriate information processing and communication capabilities, taking various project characteristics into consideration. © 2009 IEEE."Presents the results of a survey of 449 authors about their preferences and conceptions of the editing process Reports their experience with the editing process; their conceptualization of the process; their preferences about phrasing of comments and editorial mode; and their likeliness to accept suggestions."Those who submit manuscripts to academic journals may benefit from a better understanding of how editors weigh ethics in their interactions with authors. In an attempt to ascertain and to understand editors' ethics, we interviewed 3 current academic journal editors of technical and/or business communication journals. We asked them about the ethical dilemmas they encountered while working with authors, whether the editors formally or informally followed a ""code of ethics,"" and if they felt obligated to maintain any ethical codes in particular. In this article, we discuss the ethical dimensions of editorial practices using specific ethical scenarios provided by these three editors. We then analyze these scenarios using traditional ethical models in our field but also in terms of a less-known but powerful model of ethical analysis originally proposed by the philosopher C. S. Peirce. We argue that Peirce's ""community of inquiry"" ethics model best describes these journal editors' ethics when working with authors."Examines how open source software (OSS) relates to offshoring.

I suggest that Brush Talks reveals a tension between institutionalized science and science in the public, and a gap between the making of scientific knowledge and the communication of such knowledge to the general public. In writing Brush Talks, Shen preserved and popularized grassroots science and technology in the most respected medium of his time-the printed book. In the article, I ask what formal elements of this book reveal about the choices Shen made as a literati author to connect to his primary readers, most of which were middle and lower class lay audiences. As I will argue, he used three approaches that aided him in speaking to the public about science and technology-an ethnographic approach to knowledge, innovative uses of genre, and a straightforward writing style. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article examines the role that reflective assessment plays in contributing to the quality of students' visual designs. Students who are required to account for their rhetorical decisions in the design of a document benefit from the practice of verbalizing those decisions. However, this study shows that students who engage in reflective assessment actually produce stronger visual designs as well. This effect should help determine the extent to which such assessments should be included in the classroom. © 2013 Copyright Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""This study applies three models of attribution to examine the public’s responses to corporate crises. Using Kelley’s covariation model and Coombs’s situational crisis communication theory, the study shows that distinctiveness information has strong and robust effects, consistency information has some effects, and consensus information has no effects on attributions of corporate responsibility, purchase intentions, and punitive opinions. Based on Weiner’s model, this study finds that attributions of corporate responsibility result in punitive opinions guided by retributive rather than utilitarian motivations. © The Author(s) 2014"Positions the ISTE method within the broader context of usability testing and then describes its basic approach and some recent applications.

An experimental study manipulating the two specific channel interface characteristics was conducted to test the proposed model. Results indicate that symbol sets have a positive effect on knowledge possessed and knowledge applied. Motivation to learn significantly affected knowledge possessed and knowledge applied, while absorptive capacity was found to only influence knowledge possessed. The hypothesized relationships between reprocessability and knowledge internalization were marginally supported, and future research is suggested to address this issue. © 2010 IEEE.""The authors evaluate the role of listening among managerial levels in several businessorganizations.

The purpose of this study was to examine more closely the specific communication skills required of accounting professionals. Clear messages are vitally important so the client and the accountant understand each other and the content of discussions. Whatever method of communication used, accounting professionals represent their company every time they write a letter or make a personal contact with a client.""Two teachers of business and technical writing at the university level apply their understanding of current writing theory in an effort to make sense out of writing problems they encountered while consulting for a large software corporation. They discover that the writing problems there are largely situational—brought about by management's assumptions regarding writing, writers, and the role of the writing consultant-and have little to do with the abilities of the writers themselves. They conclude that if corporations are to succeed in effectively using the talents of their writers, educators should be hired as consultants. Educators are more likely to know how to involve the entire corporation in promoting the long-term growth of writers. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Many connections can and have been established in response to that concern. However, both practitioners and educators may mistakenly see such connections as a one-way exchange: practitioners with privileged knowledge sharing as a professional courtesy and with hopes of hiring graduates who may need less training on the job. However, the growth and sophistication of scholarship in professional communication, along with changes in the workplace that have led to more professional development needs among practitioners, have created new opportunities for two-way exchanges of expertise. Academics from professional communication programs now can and should use their programs' connections with the workplace to influence practices in the field. This article suggests ways to create more bi-directional educational exchanges. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Proficient communications in America's Fortune 1000 were surveyed to discover whether their attitudes toward business slang expressions, or ""buzzwords,"" were as negative as the attitudes generally encountered in academics and journalists.

In business college she wrote one sales letter, one collection letter, one favor request letter, and one job application letter—and another application when she graduated and applied for work. Her new boss says, “Write an inter-branch memo that'll speed up my counterpart in the Dayton office. We've called him and called him, but I'm getting the idea he doesn't believe what he doesn't see on paper. Dayton is holding up our Air Force contract on superwide radials. If they mess around much longer our competitor's going to get that business, but it'll be OUR fault, not theirs. Oh, and put my name on the memo, Don't get 'em mad, though. Here's the file.

In addition to largely ignoring the career experiences of women, the career literature pays little attention to overcoming barriers to career advancement in organizationsĝ €""a challenge many women and men both face over the course of their career development. Using survey data, analyses of in-depth interviews, and a focus group discussion with female executives in the high-tech industry, this study finds variations of three responses: exit, voice, and rationalizing to remain are used by women in response to career barriers. These responses form the foundation of a career barrier sensemaking and response framework presented in the study. Findings indicate that perceived organizational sanctioning of career barriers and the organization's commitment to the career advancement of other women also influence participants' responses to barriers and their strategies for sensemaking, respectively. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study suggests an approach for expanding and integrating research to produce a history of technical writing.

This article uses a stakeholder education approach to propose two new kinds of internship processes to benefit all three groups. The first approach - colloquia - allows all three parties to interact via the same scheduled event. The second approach - student publications groups - shifts internship from a workplace to a school activity. By including such approaches into their curricula, technical communication programs can both improve their relationships with local internship providers and improve the training received by their students.""As a relatively innovative teaching/learning approach in the Arabian Gulf region, in general, and in Oman, in particular, project-based learning requires progressive amendments and adaptations to the national culture of the learner.

In this article, we enhance the notion of kairos in rhetorical situations with the perceptions of risk and the sociological concept of moral panic by tracing three kairotic moments involving MSOP: The 1992 Dennis Linehan civil commitment case; the 2003 murder of college student Dru Sjodin; and the 2012 provisional discharge of Clarence Opheim. We examine the political, public, and media response to these events and provide the results of 21 interviews with stakeholders. In doing so, we hope to illustrate how moral panic and risk perception can so influence what seems the right choice at the right time that stakeholders may get caught in what we call kairotic cycles, where solutions to a problem are stymied by competing perceptions and by entrenched positions that reoccur over time and without resolution. © 2015, The Author(s).""This paper provides an introduction to the special issue on Expanding the Boundaries of E-Collaboration.

This singular perspective of translation can be seen in professional communication literature that tends to focus on how to better ""write for translation"" rather than exploring other ways in which technical communicators might be able to make use of translators or the translation process. While English is a key language used in international technicaland scientific discourse, it is not the only language being used. Speakers of languages other than English are increasingly contributing to various scientific and technical fields. As a result of this factor, technical communicators should begin rethinking ways in which they view and use translation if they wish to remain effective communicators in the new global marketplace.""The article presents a cross-case comparison of experiences from organizational adoption and use of e-collaboration technologies in two large global companies. Challenges in the global implementation process were found to increase with the organizational and geographical scope of the implementation, level of autonomy in the adoption process, cultural diversity, technological heterogeneity, and level of work process support embedded in the system. Alignment with existing collaborative work practices resulted in faster adoption of the technological solution. Highly competitive conditions restricted the resources available for training and experience transfer between projects. Clients' preferences for co-located project operations served as a potential barrier to the very concept of global e-collaboration. The study increases our understanding of the adoption and use of permanent e-collaboration infrastructures at the organizational level, thus expanding the focus of global e-collaboration research beyond the level of ad hoc, virtual teams. © 2005 IEEE.""As Facebook becomes increasingly more popular as a communication tool for businesses and organizations, it is important that our students learn to transfer personal Facebook skills to professional settings.

By providing opportunities for experiential education-active learning that occurs both inside and outside the classroom-teachers can ensure that their students receive the type of education that will allow them to succeed. This paper describes how teachers can structure course work so that students complete assignments similar to projects they will complete as professionals. To provide experiential learning outside the classroom, educators can include internships or co-ops in their academic programs, encourage students to become active members in professional organizations, and help students complete professional activities such as giving papers at meetings and conferences and publishing articles in newsletters, proceedings, and journals. © 1988 IEEE""The inclusion of cases and simulations in our curricula may reflect a fundamental paradigm shift in American higher education. Now, colleges must do more than instruct; they must also prove that learning takes place. While the movement toward experiential learning has grown, surprisingly little mention has been made in the literature of the need to ground the use of cases and simulations in experiential learning theory. A basic understanding of the experiential learning process and the nature of cases and simulations as expe riential activities will help instructors of business communication develop, evaluate, and use these tools more effectively. © 1997, Sage Publications.

Experimental results showed the inadequacy of the existing models based on diffusion-controlled combustion mechanism. Chemical kinetics and mass transfer of oxygen by forced convection were important controlling influences. Bed design and operating parameters were varied and shown to effect burning rates of carbon in fluidized beds considerably."Experiments on the catalytic oxidation of o-xylene have been carried out using a slugging-bed reactor.

Design principles and capabilities of the system are discussed from a graphic designer's point of view. The system allows a designer to choose freely among 128 different colors, various form modes, and collage capabilities, including image mixing. The designer need be neither a programmer nor one who understands the technical aspects of the system to use it creatively. Experimental results are shown visually here, some of which have been used as cover designs for IBM publications."In trying to explain special scientific and engineering concepts technical writers may find it useful to: (1) use operational definitions; (2) try the explanation out as a speech first; (3) explain the strategy of an investigation before discussing the tactics; (4) concentrate on the introduction of an article or report; (5) express mathematical ideas in English before using symbols; (6) explain the practical application of important equations; (7) use simple but accurate language; (8) use appositives; (9) do not strive for ambiguous variety; and (10) show the reader how the world looks to the expert."In argumentative texts, authors must choose between two presentation orders: providing the decision or claim first and then the explanation (direct order) or providing the explanation first and then the decision (indirect order). This study addresses which presentation order is most effective when the decision entails bad news by discussing two experiments that evaluate Dutch letters and e-mails. The first experiment evaluates denial letters from insurance companies and rejection letters to job applicants in which the presentation order is manipulated. The second experiment replicates the first, using a different medium (e-mail) and other instances of bad news. The results of both experiments indicate that readers perceive texts with the indirect order as more comprehensible and agreeable and its writer as more competent and empathic. Readers are also more inclined to comply with the decision in such texts when the explanation is presented first. ©2011 SAGE Publications.""Textbook advice regarding “negative messages” generally prescribes the use of an explanation (traditionally as part of the “indirect plan”). This paper continues a line of research applying linguistic pragmatics, in this case Speech Act Theory, to professional writing. Specifically, I argue here that Speech Act Theory supports the use of an explanation in composing negative messages and also provides a useful classification of such explanations based on five universal strategies for politely refusing requests. This classification, in turn, illuminates some problems which novice writers exhibit in “inventing” explanations and has some specific pedagogical implications. © 1990, Sage Publications.

This rationale provided the impetus for this research project, which involved analyzing the results of a questionnaire sent to the editors of 300 employee publications. Respondents were also asked to include a copy of their employee publication and 53 editors did so. The basic analysis consisted of examining the survey responses and critically analyzing the actual publications. A theoretical orientation to the unique dynamics faced by editors is presented and five basic conclusions were reached in the study. First, the results of this study were similar to past research on the characteristics of the “typical publication.” Second, there appears to be some congruency between the stated purpose and the type of articles actually contained in the publications. Third, there was little evidence that employee publications were formally evaluated. Fourth, the major purpose and focus of employee publications appears to be employee recognition. Fifth, the evidence suggests that many editors appear to be leaning towards the “trivialization” strategy. © 1986, Sage Publications.

As we prepare for the world of the future, it becomes imperative that we give students the experience of working in multicultural distributed teams. In order to gain experience in this area, a project between ten teams of students from the City University of Hong Kong and the Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands was initiated. A variety of group support technologies, primarily GroupSystems, were used to service the teams as they learned to work together. This paper documents experiences from the Hong Kong-Netherlands project. Eight out of ten student teams successfully concluded a seven-week exercise resulting in an integrated report related to software engineering. Data collected on the process are reported and discussed. Those student teams who succeeded were found to be particularly attuned and accommodating to aspects of national and professional culture.""This article presents selective findings from an ongoing study that investigates rhetorical differences in business letter writing between Vietnamese students taking an English for Specific Purposes course in Vietnam and business professionals. Rhetorical analyses are based on two corpora, namely, scenario (N = 20) and authentic business letters of request (N = 25). Two criteria, the notion of move (a meaningful unit in linguistic form contributing to the communicative purposes of a text) and linguistic properties, are used for rhetorical analysis, supplemented by analysis of data from interviews with student participants. Based on the findings and discussions, recommendations are offered for preparing students well for the business workplace through incorporating more authentic models and contexts into pedagogical strategies. © 2012 Association for Business Communication.""This article explores how CEOs attempt to influence readers and project a positive personal and corporate image in company annual reports. It examines the role of metadiscourse, as a manifestation of the writer's linguistic and rhetorical presence in a text, to show how CEOs use non-propositional material to realize rational, credible, and affective appeals. The findings are based on a close textual and linguistic analysis of 137 CEOs' letters drawn from a range of international and Hong Kong companies, representing a mix of high- and medium-performing corporations from various business sectors and registered with the three major Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong. Metadiscourse allows CEOs to control the information they provide by using expressions that organize and evaluate that information in order to direct readers how they should understand and appraise the subject matter. The analysis reveals the essentially rhetorical nature of CEOs' letters by comparing the frequency and distribution of metadiscourse in CEOs' letters and directors' reports taken from the same annual reports. The study suggests a descriptive framework for metadiscourse in business communication and points to the need for a rhetorical awareness of this persuasive genre. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication."Why are virtual worlds increasingly relevant to technical communicators? What human factors influence the design of virtual worlds? This article explores these two important questions from a technical communication perspective."The author argues that the major reason why Robert Pirsig's 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,' first published in 1974, continues to attract so much interest lies in the way Pirsig challenges our values. Pirsig shows that we have lost our understanding of quality, and he explores how we can restore a sense of quality to our lives. The author suggests that technical communication could benefit from Pirsig's ideas.""With our core focus on teaching and scholarship, business communication teacher-scholars are well placed to become leaders in the international Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) movement. In this article, SoTL is defined and contextualized, three SoTL research approaches are introduced, and disciplinary research projects are suggested. A SoTL research agenda in business communication can improve our teaching practices, our students' learning, and our disciplinary knowledge in very compelling ways. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This research provides strong support for the existence of dominant media norms within organizations and describes their influence on employees' (a) perceptions of organizational norms, (b) reported media use, and (c) performance evaluations. Survey results demonstrate the presence of strong organizational norms for instant messaging (IM) and e-mail use within a large, high-tech organization. These norms, as well as supervisory behavior, may influence employees' use of IM and e-mail and even more so when employees have strong polychronic orientations. In addition, employees who reportedly followed organizational norms by using IM and e-mail were awarded higher performance ratings by their supervisors, with 30% of the variance explained. The authors support the survey findings with in-depth interviews with participants exploring media use. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communication.""With the rapid development of information communication technologies (ICT) over the past decade, the nature of how organization members communicate has changed, becoming far more complex and challenging. Communication risks brought about by technology-mediated communication can sometimes be detrimental to the overall organizational function and success. We classify these communication risks into three types: Reception, understanding, and action risks. We propose the notion of Communication Portfolio which refers to a single ICT or a specific combination of ICTs that can e used to manage any perceived risk of communication. Specifically, this study aims to examine the relationship between perceived risks (i.e., risk of reception, risk of understanding, and risk of action) in the communication process and the dimensions (i.e., size, content, and structuring mechanism) of the communication portfolio used for communication. We also identify communication risk factors that may accentuate the different types of risks. We develop a communication risk perception framework to illustrate the relationship between the communication risk factors, the different types of communication risks, and the communication portfolio. Finally, we illustrate how the communication risk perception framework can be applied in a real-life natural setting by using the shuttle Challenger incident as an example. © 2007 IEEE.""Questionnaires completed by scientists and engineers as a part of their normal work to evaluate a major contractor's performance were examined as to the type of responses. A 7500-word narrative sample from 9 scientists and 14 engineers was selected and analyzed by comparing the number of sentences per response, words per sentence, and sentence fragments, and by categorizing and counting the words that each group used to express positive or negative value. The findings indicate that scientists use more sentences and more words per sentence than do engineers; the engineers use more sentence fragments; and the two groups do not, for the most part, use the same words in evaluating a common situation. However, the content similarity of the evaluation suggests that the actual differences between scientists and engineers may be overestimated and overemphasized.""This study shows that scientists and engineers perceive differences between themselves as groups, perhaps occasioned by differences in the forms of their written communication. Actual differences between scientists and engineers, however, may be over-emphasized. © 1972, Sage Publications.

This essay suggests guidelines for curriculum and program development in technical communication based on a review of the relevant survey literature on the professional roles played by technical communicators, a review of academic literature on technical communication programs, and a review of the relevant demographic data on technical communicators. It then discusses the implications of the above for designing technical communication curricula and programs. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

What is the gap between theory and practice? Where does this gap occur? Literature review: The review informed the survey design. Usability research based on field studies and empirical tests indicates that variations in think-aloud procedures may reduce test reliability. The guidance offered on think-aloud procedures within a number of handbooks on usability testing is also mixed. This indicates potential variability in practice, but how much and for what reasons is unknown. Methodology: An exploratory, qualitative survey was conducted using a web-based questionnaire (during November-December 2010). Usability evaluators were sought via emails (sent to personal contacts, usability companies, conference attendees, and special interest groups) to be cascaded to the international community. As a result we received 207 full responses. Descriptive statistics and thematic coding were used to analyze the data sets. Results: Respondents found the concurrent technique particularly suited usability testing as it was fast, easy for users to relate to, and requires limited resources. Divergent practice was reported in terms of think-aloud instructions, practice, interventions, and the use of demonstrations. A range of interventions was used to better understand participant actions and verbalizations, however, respondents were aware of potential threats to test reliability, and took steps to reduce this impact. Implications: The reliability considerations underpinning the classic think-aloud approach are pragmatically balanced against the need to capture useful data in the time available. A limitation of the study is the focus on the concurrent method; other methods were explored but the differences in application were not considered. Future work is needed to explore the impact of divergent use of think-aloud instructions, practice tasks, and the use of demonstrations on test reliability.""Within a Technical Communication classroom, policywork has been used to teach students the vital discursive and conceptual skills valued by technical fields. However, given the move of technical communicators into the public sphere, these skills can and should be expanded to include diverse practices and modes of thought. As such, this article suggests that storytelling can be used as a pedagogical tool to help students think more critically about the (sometimes hidden) relationships that policywork inheres. This article articulates relational work as a target skills set for students and suggests specific activities and handouts for developing these skills. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This study explores the role of email in organizational dissent expression and employees' perceptions of the rules for using this medium. Twenty-one interviews were conducted with employees who commonly used email in their job to learn about some of the ways email was seen as playing a role in organizational dissent by those who commonly use the technology. Thematic analysis of data produced two rules employees cited for email usage: be careful what is committed to writing (because of loss of message control and fear of being monitored) and maintain an appropriate, professional communication style (free of emotion, sent only to the appropriate people, and used for topics not needing face-to-face interaction). Three additional strategic roles of email in organizational dissent include emails as a means of promoting strategic self-presentation; email as a means of inviting dissent; and email as a means of documenting/archiving potentially problematic interactions. The implications of this study for existing and future studies of dissent are explored. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""As students participate in corporate communication classes, they may, on occasion, use the term culture to make sense of their experiences. The authors use Mino's idea of a learning paradigm to shift the emphasis away from teaching traditional theories of culture and use student-centered experiences to teach culture as an expressive practice. Using instances drawn from their own classrooms, the authors show how students can recognize the value of understanding their role in creating culture each time they choose how to act, how to evaluate others' behavior, and whether to label what is going on as cultural. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""While the importance of ""expressive writing,"" or informal, self-directed writing, has been well established, teachers underutilize it, particularly in technical writing courses. We introduce the term expressive/exploratory technical writing (XTW), which is the use of informal, self-directed writing to problem-solve in technical fields. We describe how engineering students resist writing, despite decades of research showing its importance to their careers, and we suggest that such resistance may be because most students only see writing as an audience-driven performance and thus incompletely understand the link between writing and thinking. The treatment of invention in rhetorical history supports their view. We describe two examples of using XTW in software engineering to plan programming tasks. We conclude by discussing how a systematic use of XTW could shift the technical writing curriculum, imbuing the curriculum with writing and helping students see how to problem-solve using natural language.""In the study of law, postmodernism's interpretive turn has given rise to a wealth of scholarship analyzing the relationship of law's rhetoric to its social, cultural, and political contexts. This shift has influenced some teaching of ""substantive"" law school courses. At the university level, the interpretive turn has prompted composition scholars to reconsider how the teaching of writing is implicated, but no similar shift has occurred in legal writing pedagogy. Instead, those teaching legal writing largely teach as they were taught, emphasizing the use of rhetoric as a tool for successful lawyering. Legal writing professors must move beyond this narrow conception of rhetoric to help students become adept at the discourse of the legal community and capable of critically evaluating it.""This article describes the influence that Extensible Markup Language (XML) will have on the software documentation process and subsequently on the curricula of advanced undergraduate and master's programs in technical communication. XML, an evolving set of standards for storing and displaying information, uses nine components that make up the XML development process. Grouped into content, formatting, and language specifications, these components enhance organizations' ability to manage information more efficiently and accurately. As the XML development process is adopted, the software documentation process will evolve from a self-contained procedure into a more flexible, interactive process in which software documenters must work closely with a wide range of specialists. The changes that XML will have on the software documentation process will likewise have implications for programs in technical communication in the need to address new kinds of job descriptions, skill sets, and career paths of future technical communicators. The article recommends adaptations to existing courses, as well as new elective and required courses."Object-oriented coding languages make it possible to more accurately label and search for content embedded in electronic texts. This paper illustrates how such object-oriented languages can effectively deploy the indexing techniques and systems traditionally used by information professionals."The detection of flaws in a list provides an opportunity to widen the perspective on the list content [1]. An additional opportunity occurs when the list heading has two distinct meanings. The list may then be represented better by a two-dimensional array. The case considered is that of the term function used in a list heading. Split into its most common meanings, objective and means used, it provides a new view on the list content. It produced, for instance, a two-dimensional structure for the main functions of language."External examiners drawn from industry and from other universities have been used in a course in technical writing. The evolution of this scheme is described and other teachers of technical writing are urged to adopt it."This study examines the relationships of extra-role time (ERT) behavior with burnout and occupational commitment among teachers through the lens of conservation of resources (COR) theory. Results reveal that teachers who invest in more ERT are also more likely to experience burnout and decreased commitment to teaching than those who invest less. However, results also indicate that the ethical practice of the employer fulfilling the psychological contract (keeping promises) entered into with the teacher offsets this negative spiral with implications for both teacher well-being and workplace outcomes. © 2011 Association for Business Communication.""Eye tracking enables usability practitioners and researchers to capture and analyze people’s eye movements in terms of fixations, saccades, and scanpaths. Already popular in other research fields—such as human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, and marketing—eye tracking is just beginning to surface as a method for studying human behavior within technical communication. This article introduces technical communicators to the mechanics of eye tracking and to usability-related research in the areas of reading and scanning, and searching. It concludes with suggested areas for future eye-tracking research.""This paper attempts to establish that any medium used to convey information is an interface. That being the case, technical communicators should be able to make good use of human-factors research and techniques that deal with user interfaces.

The literature is pulled together by way of ten propositions, each presented with the supporting evidence. In general, discussions on CMC take longer, produce more ideas, and have greater equality of participation. There is reduced normative pressure and poorer comprehension of the discussion in CMC. Findings regarding quality of performance, uninhibited behavior, choice shift, attitude change, and evaluation of communication partner are not definitive. Factors limiting the internal and external validity of these studies are also discussed. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication."Suggests that information architects should allow users to flexibly navigate through complex information spaces in the service of particular tasks and goals Introduces a faceted classification framework and provides an example."To help students develop teamwork skills, teachers should be aware of the strategies students already employ to assert authority and manage conflict. Researchers studying engineering students have identified two such approaches: transfer-of-knowledge sequences, in which students emulate teacher and pupil roles; and collaborative sequences, in which students use circular talk to reach consensus. As demonstrated in this article, these strategies are also used by students in professional communication courses. The second half of this article provides specific suggestions for designing team assignments, interacting effectively with student teams, and developing evaluations that value the process of teamwork. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Drawing from the author's experience teaching online technical communication courses with an embedded service-learning component, this essay opens the discussion to the potential problems involved in designing online service-learning courses and provides practical approaches to integrating service learning into online coursework. The essay addresses specifically those classrooms where students may be required to develop or find their own service opportunities, whether those opportunities are within their community, on the college or university campus, or in another community. The essay argues by implementing service learning into online classrooms and requiring students to locate their own agencies, students not only build a greater sense of civic engagement because they are working with agencies whose missions they support, but also they develop a greater sense of responsibility for their own education and the coursework they undertake. © The Author(s) 2016.""This study examines interaction between corporate representatives and critical consumers in today's social media environment. Applying a microanalytical form of discourse analysis to a data set of corporate Facebook page discussions, the study contributes to a better understanding of the communicative resources that organizations use as part of their impression management (IM) for upholding their acceptability and promoting their credibility. The study also reveals the complexity of the work of corporate Facebook representatives, who need to align their individual IM with that of the organization while adjusting to the technologically mediated context. © The Author(s) 2013.""Factor analysis and analysis of variance are used to test ex perimentally the most effective content, organization, and pre sentation of given kinds of messages.

With the flourishing of the internet, electronic direct mail (EDM) messages have become an increasingly important and convenient mode of communication in the sales and marketing arena. This paper addresses the impact of new media on the design of such messages. Chi square test results reveal significant differences between the message-design strategy of EDMs and that of their print media counterparts.

Several kinds of activities are Implicated, such as reading with understanding, action planning, carrying out specific actions, and executive control activities. This paper proposes that, by taking into account design factors that affect these activities, technical writers can markedly improve the design of procedural documents. Thus, a model is suggested that combines information on how users deal with procedural documents when faced with new equipment and the mental processes involved in this interaction, together with document design recommendations aimed at enhancing the interactions between users, documents, and equipment.""This study investigates the factors influencing students' intentions to use emergency notification services to receive news about campus emergencies through short-message systems (SMS) and social network sites (SNS). Research questions: (1) What are the critical factors that influence students' intention to use SMS to receive emergency notifications? (2) What are the critical factors that influence students' intention to use SNS to receive emergency notifications? Literature review: By adapting Media Richness theory and prior research on emergency notifications, we propose that perceived media richness, perceived trust in information, perceived risk, perceived benefit, and perceived social influence impact the intention to use SMS and SNS to receive emergency notifications. Methodology: We conducted a quantitative, survey-based study that tested our model in five different scenarios, using logistic regression to test the research hypotheses with 574 students of a large research university in the northeastern US. Results and discussion: Results suggest that students' intention to use SNS is impacted by media richness, perceived benefit, and social influence, while students' intention to use SMS is influenced by trust and perceived benefit. Implications to emergency managers suggest how to more effectively manage and market the service through both channels. The results also suggest using SNS as an additional means of providing emergency notifications at academic institutions. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article summarizes the scholarly discussion about negative messages and reports the results of two pretests and two experiments using negative letters. The results show that buffers did not significantly affect college students' responses to simulated letters refusing credit and denying admission to graduate school and that strong resale was counterproductive. Students responded least favorably to rejection when they were surprised by it and when their other options were limited. On the basis of these experiments and the published literature, the author recommends that negative letters normally begin with the reason for the refusal. If the reason makes the company look good, then it should be spelled out in as much detail as possible. If an alternative or a compromise exists, then the writer should suggest it. Although a positive ending is not necessary, if one is used, then a bland positive is better than a strong one, especially in letters to clients or customers.""In recent years, many businesses have become involved in internationalized projects, yet understanding the dynamics of engineering communication in virtual dispersed teams is limited.Research questions: How do the factors mentioned in the literature function in an international engineering project? Are there factors that enhance or constrain the work in an engineering setting that are not mentioned in previous studies?Literature review: Existing knowledge on the contextual factors that affect virtual international professional communication is mainly built on the study of the communication practices of students or business professionals who are not engineers. Results of that literature have identified factors that enhance communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include cross-cultural training, using appropriate communication technology, face-to-face communication opportunities, respect for partners, regularly scheduled meetings, a common language, a common discipline, and cross-cultural understandings though popular media). There are factors that challenge communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include differing cultural assumptions, differing cultural communication styles, US Government export control regulations, proximity and time issues, and differing levels of perceived power and influence).Methodology: This study involved observing international engineer meetings in the US and the UK and interviewing 19 engineers leading an international design team. The participants worked for the same international company with about half from the US and half in Great Britain.Results and discussion: Many of the factors identified in general professional communication studies held true for this context. But some features were unique to an engineering environment that the literature had not previously mentioned, including iplanning for and working with intercultural dispersed virtual engineering teams and that people need to consider many complexities of culture that affect communication practices. Because this study observed one team in the context of only two cultures, future research may determine whether these factors are more widely found in other teams, workplaces, and cultures. Future research may also determine the relative levels of influence of the contextual factors on international dispersed virtual engineering teams. In addition, the study of engineers learning to communicate in international settings may be illuminating. © 2014 IEEE.""In Singapore in 2000, the government launched a Speak Good English Movement to improve English language skills and to limit the use of Singlish (a local variety of English) by promoting the use of (Standard) English among the general popula tion. This campaign was motivated by govemment perception and media reports of a decline in English language skills. Using a 40-item questionnaire, this study investigated whether faculty at a large Singapore business school shared similar perceptions of inadequate communi cation skills, in this case among undergraduates, and also sought to explain their perceptions. The findings indicate that the faculty perceived undergraduate com munication skills to be in need of improvement, thus lending support to employer and government criticism. An analysis of survey responses revealed some probable underlying causes for faculty perceptions, including an apparent lack of real com mitment to the improvement of such skills. © 2002, Sage Publications.

These changes prompted this descriptive study in which business faculty members' perceptions about the business commumcation curriculum are examined. Faculty perceive their students to have problems with basic writing skills as well as with sophisticated writing concepts and techniques. Faculty seem to agree on the content that should be included in a business communi cation course. As a result, guidelines are recommended for those who revise the business communication course.""The advantages of the captive instructor of in-house communication courses derive from a continuous close relationship with the learners, says Garner, who lists them here and then describes in his own teaching strategies and summarizes his results.""A study of the time taken for each step in the editing and publishing of research reports at one laboratory revealed 16 steps that could benefit from efforts to speed up the publication process.

Using a thematic analysis of 17 videotaped, final presentations from a capstone chemical engineering (CHE) course, it explores the rhetorical strategies, oral styles, and organizational structures that differentiate successful and unsuccessful team presentations. The results suggest that successful presenters used rhetorical strategies, oral styles, and organizational structures that illustrated students' ability to negotiate the real and simulated relational and identity nuances of the design presentation genre-in short, they illustrated students' relational genre knowledge. © 2009 SAGE Publications.""To study the possible impact of feminist theory on technical communication, this article discusses six common characteristics of feminist theory: (a) celebration of difference, (b) impact on social change, (c) acknowledgment of scholars’ backgrounds and values, (d) inclusion of women's experience, (e) study of gaps and silences in traditional scholarship, and (f) new female sources of knowledge. Three debates within feminist theory spring out of these common characteristics: whether to stress similarity or difference between the sexes, whether differences come from biological or social forces, and whether feminist scholars can avoid reinforcing binary opposition. The article then traces the impact of these characteristics of feminist theory and debates within feminist theory on the redefinition of technical communication in terms of the myth of scientific objectivity, the new interest in ethnographic studies of workplace communication, and the recent focus on collaborative writing. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

The author encourages communication specialists to do further theorizing and work on the problems of the structure of argument and the problem of finding a model which will best represent the structure of argument. Discussion is presented of inductive and deductive reasoning in arguments and syllogism. Toulmin's paradigm consists of six elements: claim, datum, warrant, backing, qualifier and rebuttal.""This article establishes traits of adaptable communicators in the 21st century, explains why adaptability should be a goal of technical communication educators, and shows how multimodal pedagogy supports adaptability. Three examples of scalable, multimodal assignments (infographics, research interviews, and software demonstrations) that evidence this philosophy are discussed in detail. Asking students to communicate multimodally drives them to effectively filter information, remix modes, and remake practices that are core characteristics of adaptable communicators. Beyond teaching students how to teach themselves as an essential part of living in an information society, contending with new and unfamiliar tools also prepares students for their roles as empathic mediators in the workplace. © The Author(s) 2015.""Rapidly rising costs for printing and distribution are placing increased pressure on the publication operations of scientific societies to reassess support from traditional revenue sources.

One valuable skill is that of analyzing how a document will be used. Creating easy-to-read texts also requires the twin skills of language control and judicious selection among graphic and typographic options. Evaluating the cost-benefits of alternative presentations requires a fourth skill, sophisticated interpretation of the available research findings (laboratory findings are not suitable for rote application). A fifth set of skills that are useful to the technical writer concerns the management of the production process, where administrative and interpersonal factors must be deftly handled. Whether these diverse skills can be found within one person seems an open question which has important implications for the training of technical authors and the operation of technical writing departments.""The characteristics of three types of display devices, liquid crystals (LCD), light emitting diodes (LED) and plasma matrix displays (PMD) are discussed and compared withthose of the cathode ray tube. With respect to applications both the LED and PMD are said to be superior to the CRT where popularity is a consideration, while the lower power requirements and excellent readability in bright light of LCDs are offset by their slow switching time.""This study examines the influence of epistemology on women's perceptions of the workplace, themselves, and their work, and the relationship of these perceptions to career mentoring. Three epistemological categories, based upon theoretical definitions provided by Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, and Tarule (1986), in Women's Ways of Knowing, are identified and tested for differences in workplace perceptions and mentoring relationships: constructivists, proceduralists, and subjectivists. The sample is drawn from the membership of American Women in Radio and Television (AWRT) (n = 454). The three groups differ significantly in perceptions of self-efficacy, career opportunities, and effective mentoring roles and similarities that exist between mentor and protege.

In the activity, students identify a sample, collect customer tweets, and analyze the language of the tweets in an effort to construct knowledge about an audience’s values, needs, and attitudes. The article first presents an overview of audience analysis frameworks. It then presents a step-by-step tutorial for integrating the activity. The authors also provide business communication instructors with resources for implementing the activity including video lectures, handouts, and instructional guides. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""Business communication evolves and adapts to suit the times, and today’s workplace documents are increasingly multimodal. Therefore, business and professional communication specialists need to adapt to a new media workplace ecology—one that requires proficiencies with technologies such as video production, digital animation, and sound. Business and professional writing teachers, in turn, need to adopt teaching methods that include working with evolving technologies and be willing to teach multimodal skills to students. In this article I offer a case study of a flipped learning pedagogy to teach multimodal skills in the professional writing classroom. © 2016 by the Association for Business Communication Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.""This article argues for a flipped learning approach to business and professional communication composing processes. Flipped learning sequences can scaffold more robust engagement with prewriting activities and support opportunities for in-class collaborative and facilitated drafting exercises. These types of learning experiences offer numerous pedagogical benefits, including more conscious control of messaging strategies and the development of more creative, rhetorically informed communication products. The effectiveness of this approach is explored through a case study of a flipped learning sequence and collaborative drafting workshop designed for an employment communication and résumé-writing assignment. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article examines how Web 2.0 technologies can be used to “flip” the online classroom by creating asynchronous workshops in social environments where immediacy and social presence can be maximized. Using experience teaching several communication and writing classes in Google Apps (Google+, Google Hangouts, Google Drive, etc.), I argue that flipping the classroom online with Web 2.0 technologies can maximize student participation and engagement, while also helping students develop flexible strategies for writing collaboratively and publicly in online spaces. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""Flipping originated in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, where didactic transmission of conceptual knowledge has been the standard pedagogy. Flipping has resulted in additional focus on procedural knowledge within class meetings. This article argues that business and professional writing pedagogy, which already focuses largely on procedural knowledge within class meetings, would benefit from flipping because it could create an additional focus on conceptual knowledge outside of the classroom. The article explains why we need to teach conceptual foundations, why video is a good choice for that teaching, and what challenges we face in creating those instructional videos. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication."Measurements in the freeboard of a pilot scale fluidized bed coal combustor showed a substantial reduction in the levels of NO//x with increasing elevation above the bed. This reduction is described by a model which takes into account the reaction between NO//x and the carbonaceous particles entrained from the bed. The model was used to evaluate the impact of changing bed solid and coal feed size on both NO//x reduction and carbon combustion efficiency in order to guide the selection of conditions which can maximize the reduction of NO//x without incurring a significant penalty in combustion efficiency.The operating performance of a 2. 6 m multiplied by 1. 6 m fluidized bed combustor with a nominal throughput of 2 ton/hr of wastes from a coal preparation plant is described. Results of plant trials are presented to show that combinations of coarse rejects and thickened tailings can be treated without recourse to auxiliary fuel. Calculations are presented which illustrate that with only small additions of coarse rejects the unthickened tailings could also be burned."Fluidization experiments were made with different sized oil shale particles. Minimum fluidization velocities and other fluidization characteristics were determined at room temperature. Steady state combustion experiments were performed under controlled conditions. Thermogravimetric data were used to monitor the amount of organic matter and carbonates, providing the needed information on the degree of combustion and the amount of carbonates decomposed.""This article identifies advantages and disadvantages of using focus groups rather than individual interviews in evaluating texts.  Focus groups tended to identify acceptance problems, while individual interview participants focused on comprehension.""This essay outlines focus groups as a relatively new method of research for the communication and organizational researcher. The needs for this type of research, essential ingredients of a quality focus group session, and the advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed. A theoretical framework is established and specific instances of the application of focus groups in recent organizational research are given. Finally, suggested methods for analyzing focus group data are presented. © 1991, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.""Food fight! In 2002, a battle flared in Orange County, California, over a store seeking the local Hispanic/Latin market. Members of the Anaheim City Council objected to the opening of a new grocery store by the Mexico-based chain Gigante as ""too Spanish."" At issue were Gigante's use of Spanish language signage, Spanish-speaking clerks, and a product mix attentive to Hispanic tastes. Gigante's struggle to be viewed as a legitimate grocery chain competing for American consumers highlights the conflicts faced by growing ethnic populations, as new economic power is hampered by lagging political and communicative power. The path to public legitimacy is fraught with challenges, for organizations and consumers. Market forces exert tremendous influence on the processes of identity construction and acculturation, as California and the nation struggle to come to terms with immigration, economics, and competing notions of identity. This article presents a close analysis of the communicative constructions of acculturation and identity, framed by the rhetoric of legitimation-in-progress, enacted through capitalism, and encapsulated in a food fight in Anaheim yielding crucial information for multicultural businesses looking to expand their U.S. market share. © 2012 Association for Business Communication."Field narratives that (re)classify technical genres as liberating for women risk supporting the notion that feminism is a completed project in technical communication scholarship. This article suggests that technical communicators reexamine the impact of past approaches to critical engagement at the intersections of gender studies and technical communication; cookbooks provide a material example. The authors illustrate how a feminist approach to cookbooks as technical/cultural artifacts can productively revise field narratives in technical communication. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing."In an advanced technical and professional writing course, a pair of in-class exercises integrates the teaching of teamwork with other class topics of project management and observation-based research. The first exercise introduces teamwork in a positive way, by raising awareness of strategies for solving problems successfully. The second exercise follows up on the first, focusing on assessment of problem-solving teamwork. The pair of exercises is memorable and effective, showing students in an engaging, thought-provoking way that they have control and responsibility for the success of their teamwork. The materials for conducting the exercises, provided here, encourage reflection and discussion. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""Foresters are now finding themselves openly involved in public controversy over management of the resources they have been trained to understand and manipulate. They perceive themselves as caught between competing/conflicting interest groups and battered by ill-informed and often biased media. Survey research explored here shows that foresters spend much of their working time writing and communicating orally and that a large part of this communication is for audiences outside their agencies. Traditional forestry curricula have done little to foster an understanding of the rhetorical situations facing foresters outside the academy. The author discusses the discipline-specific communications program in forestry offered at North Carolina University, which works to broaden students' understanding of the contexts in which they will work and sharpen the tools they will need in the public arena.""The experimental paper is conventionally organized into four sections: Introduction, Methods and Materials, Results, and Discussion. Why these particular sections? Why this particular order? The author's answer is that the experimental paper is an instantiation of a myth that induction is philosophically unproblematic, that it can lead unproblematically to reliable knowledge about the natural world. Because induction as a path to reliable knowledge is, in fact, problematic, scientists need to retain this myth to continue to do science undeterred by doubts concerning the value of their task."Some of the results of research into the relationship between grammatical choice and rhetorical function in English for Science and Technology (EST) are described. Some details about procedures used in EST courses for non-native speakers are presented. Changes made in these procedures through application of the results of research are emphasized. Some unsolved problems are referred to."Formalization of cognitive grammar depends in an important way on modeling the process of assessing similarity. This article points out that such formalization is difficult to achieve within the present formulation [1] of the grammar and introduces a modification that will allow modeling the process of similarity. Next, it is suggested that the mechanism of assessing similarity in the modified analogical-operatorial version of cognitive grammar be that of analogical modeling presented in Skousen [2]. Finally, it indicates some consequences of the proposition for the practice of communication. The modification, the analogical-operatorial mode of language use, allows linguistic units, in addition to their function of representing the semantic meaning of these units, to serve as operators differentiating among semantic or other conceptual structures. This introduces inhomogeneity to the content purported with linguistic units and leads to preserving linguistic compositionality understood in a new sense. It also allows one to treat the pragmatic meaning in the same way as the semantic one, and accounts for a compact use of linguistic units. Using linguistic units to differentiate allows one to convey information not contained in the encoded meaning of these structures. This can be utilized to communicate more efficiently but also poses the danger of purporting unwanted meaning.""Research in cognitive psychology, instructional technology, and human factors applies to formatting complex instructions for equipment and procedures. Formatting includes typographic cueing of prose paragraphs and more graphic displays of text in flowcharts and structured writing.

These organizations play a crucial role in education by giving students the opportunity to apply concepts learned in the classroom. Ithas been noted that ℌLearning by doing is one of the best ways to maximize the learning processℍ (Bare & Hoggat, 1986). Through participation in formal student activities, students become more cognizant of their educational environment and the learning opportunities available to them. Activities give more meaning to students’ lives and allow them to identify long range objectives and goals (Morrell & Morrell, 1986). Clubs provide an outlet for people to impact on society and to learn about themselves (Conye, 1983). The purpose of this research was as follows: (1) To determine the need for a Business Communication student association for Business Communication students; (2) To determine the willingness of students to become involved in such an organization; and (3) To determine how to start the organization and keep it running smoothly and successfully. Questionnaires were given to Business Communication majors at The University of Southwestern Louisiana to determine their interest in a Business Communication student organization, their willingness to take part in the activities of the organization, and what they would like to gain as a result of having been in the organization. Sixty-six questionnaires (69 percent) were returned. Interviews were also conducted with the faculty advisors of other student organizations in the College of Business Administration to gain insights into appropriate activities for such organizations, problems faced by student organizations, and ways to motivate students to participate in their organizations. University guidelines for the formation of student organizations were also obtained from appropriate university offices. In addition, secondary research into student organizations was conducted in the university library. Conclusions drawn from the study include the following: 1. Enthusiastic and hard workingmembers, successful recruitment, interesting activities, and motivated members are needed to make a student organization successful. 2. A large majority of the Business Communication students at The University of Southwestern Louisiana have an interest in a Business Communication student organization. 3. A large majority also feel that a Business Communication student organization would be beneficial to developing their careers. 4. Less than half of the respondents would be willing to serve on a committee to plan and organize the club, or to hold office in the club. However, the number of students who expressed a willingness to participate in the formation and running of the club was more than adequate. 5. A Business Communication student organization should be formed on The University of Southwestern Louisiana campus, and other universities should also investigate the feasibility offorming such an organization on their campuses. © 1989, Sage Publications.

One group of construction engineers and another group of design architects and engineers, both working in a bureaucratic setting, relied on disciplinary and institutional conventions while constructing, addressing, and invoking audiences. Incongruities among contextual conventions restricting audience analysis resulted in inappropriate textual features and necessitated conversation during corporate training. This conversation focused on redefining problems of audience analysis and accommodation. The problem solving associated with analyzing situational audiences during the composing process was possible only when writers understood the problem-posing conventions of their discourse communities. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

We will investigate the process whereby decisions are produced, before being announced, by looking at turn design and sequence organization in the interaction, and by considering cultural presuppositions, which are specific patterns of expectations about interlocutors' expectations. In so doing, we will try to combine theories and methodologies deriving from Conversation Analysis and Social Systems Theory. The article deals with interactionally achieved patterns of expectations concerning participants' positioning in decision making and analyzes two different forms of decision making, namely, gatekeeping and coordination of participative decision making. These are analyzed within the framework of organizational meetings in which educational activities for children's camps are planned. The analysis of videotaped and transcribed interactions taking place during these meetings highlights the ways in which different forms of decision making are socially constructed. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study is a comprehensive census of the homepage design practices of Fortune 500 companies, analyzing 46 elements of homepage design.

Flip-chart preparation requires minimal lead time and is inexpensive. Among these tips are the following: Prepare pages in advance with light pencil. Practice printing in block letters. Put a brief title on completed pages and post them on the wall. Use watercolor markers and leave a blank sheet between pages to prevent bleed-through. Use several easels for developing complex concepts."This article examines online help forums as a form of technical communication. The purpose of the article is to explore the similarities between moderators of help forums and technical communicators. The article argues that technical communicators are uniquely suited to step in as “community managers” of companies’ official online help forums.Method: This study reports on qualitative research done with 23 help forum moderators. The researcher used an iterative grounded theory approach to seek out research participants and code the interview data to examine emergent data categories. The research was also supplemented by six months of observation and an extensive memoing process.Results: The interviews with forum moderators show that help forum moderation requires many of the skills technical communicators already possess. Moderators play an important role in the health of online help forums, and they must be able to work with subject-matter experts, edit content, organize material, create content, and shape the overall tone of the forum.Conclusion: Many companies now sponsor official help forums, and these companies need community managers to run these sites. The data reported in this study show that technical communicators possess the skills to succeed in these positions and help develop professional online help forums. In conclusion, technical communicators have a strong case to make that they are well positioned to step in as community managers, especially of professionally sponsored online help forums. © 2014, Technical Communication.

Employing an interdisciplinary approach, this test presents a process-centered approach using genre ecology modeling and narrative maps. This approach can help scholars understand how genre and narrative dialectically promote collaboration and coordination while simultaneously promoting the process of consubstantiality and rhetorical identification in networked organizations. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Multimedia allows a technical communication to be flexible in concept and format; broken into component parts; related to more easily understood phenomena; placed in historical context; paced in consistent, logical ways; and moving in a literal sense. Yet many technical communicators resist the technique because of a lack of familiarity with it. Additional empirical evidence of the effects of multimedia on technical messages is needed. Four paradigms - on content, layered audiences, complexity, and importance - are suggested for further research. Together, these paradigms represent a hypothesis leading toward a general theory on technical communication in multimedia.""This paper gives four principles for preparing multimedia instructional sequences and experimental methods for applying the principles. Multimedia means visual and verbal material (such as a film or a text with illustrations) and actual practice. The instructions focused on are for the assembly of physical objects, but the principles are not restricted to assembly applications. It also describes the empirical experiments on which the principles are based. Principle 1 is a criterion for good terminology for unfamiliar objects, actions, and situations, with methods for deriving such terminology. Principle 2 tells how to overlap visual and spoken elements in time (as in a movie or a lecture with slides) to form good associations. Principle 3 states that division of instructions into conceptual units should agree with people's natural conceptualization. A method is presented for finding the natural conceptualization. Principle 4 treats mixing audiovisual instruction with hands-on practice in learning a procedure.""Along with the verbal message conveyed in the business letter there is often metacommunication, nonverbal and unseen, a phantom intelligence transmitted by the writer to the reader.

It argues that political media can be seen as examples of Appadurai's localities, promoting individual identity through the creation of narratives of the Other, in keeping with Said's study of Orientalism. By comparing the localizing techniques used in response to the unique political situation of the bailout vote, it is possible to determine the extent to which liberal and conservative localities share identity-producing techniques, and also the extent to which each ideological locality maintains an identity distinct from the partisan localities of the two major U.S. political parties. The results indicate that in this instance both localities share localizing techniques, but differ in their relation to their associated political parties, with the conservative locality subsumed into the Republican Party, but the liberal locality clearly distinct from the Democratic Party. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Although much has been written about the use of rhetoric in technical communication, the framing of technical documents often is overlooked. Framing differs from rhetoric chiefly in that it involves the use of content selection and structure to place information in a particular context. In this article, I will analyze the techniques used to frame a technical report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's ""Summary for Policymakers,"" and compare them to the techniques used to frame corporate news releases and newspaper articles written about the report. This framing analysis shows that writers of technical documents, news releases, and news articles frame their documents chiefly by choosing which facts to include or exclude, and by the positioning of information within the document.""A conceptual framework for assessing scientific journal quality, both on intrinsic and on relative scales, is outlined. Several quantitative tools for objective estimation of relative quality are discussed, including volume use, citation analysis, quality sampling, and rejection rate analysis. The identification of factors that contribute to journal quality, and the implications for quality control, are briefly considered.""Word processing is an activity that involves changing the text of ″written″ matter. Changes can range from correcting typos to inserting and moving paragraphs. Today, manufacturers have devised so many word-processing systems for office operations that the communicator is confronted with a bewildering variety of equipment.

The article opens with a brief discussion of CSR and its critical importance to transnationals such as Nike. The opening also includes four research questions guiding this study. The article then discusses why frame analysis offers such a potentially rich approach to analyzing public relations controversies like this one. The Analysis section of the article examines how an anti-Nike coalition initially succeeded in imposing negative frames on two CSR issues and how this framing generated highly negative media coverage. The remainder of this section provides a detailed commentary on eight Web texts from Nikebiz. com and how the framing strategy behind these texts enabled the company ultimately to defend, even to enhance its CSR reputation. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Environmental scientists and science communicators working to educate the public on the science of global climate change often work to present information through an environmentalist perspective. This article uses theories of metaphoric framing to present six guidelines that climate change communicators can use to reframe climate change science in public communication. In particular, the authors argue for environmental scientists to adopt frames that the broader public will find familiar and persuasive. This reframing of environmental science is necessary to counter the framing of skepticism that special interest groups have used to dominate attempts to communicate climate change science to the public. © 2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Corporate social responsibility is a topic that is increasingly incorporated into business school curricula. This article describes a study of undergraduate business majors who wrote about an environmental topic in response to an Analytical Writing Assessment question in the Graduate Management Admission Test™. Of 187 students, only 76 mentioned natural resources in their responses. The study examines this smaller corpus for stance, framing, and argument. The results indicate that the majority of those 76 students supported sustainable practices but were less adept at presenting their perspectives, invoking a personal frame over a professional one. The authors suggest ways to help students develop stronger skills in writing about corporate social responsibility. © The Author(s) 2013.""Having students read selected portions of Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography provides unique and effective material for supplementing instruction in style and control of tone. Franklin's writing exemplifies the major style characteristics taught in technical writing: active voice, conciseness, common words, concrete language, sentences structured by clauses rather than phrases. The work clearly shows that good ″technical″ style is not an isolated type of writing, but a powerful means of controlling tone and meaning. Students can be shown that by skillfully using syntax and diction and by carefully selecting content, Franklin shrewdly and effectively achieved his goal in writing the Autobiography - a precisely drawn image of himself for posterity."Whether engineering students should be taught English and the communication skills in separate classes is a problem that has plagued teachers for many years. The author thinks that no distinction should be made between English for engineers and English for other students."Freelance technical writers perform their work outside their clients' corporate culture, and this occurrence is becoming more and more common. It is important to understand the significance of the separation between technical writers and corporate culture, especially given that some freelance technical writers never meet their clients in person.

This article reviews how a major French scientific monthly has addressed itself to the problem, and how it deals with a lack of specialized manpower in the field.""The use of sports metaphors to convey business lessons both within and outside the classroom is a common phenomenon. The sports metaphor, however, is prone to misuse and can often inadvertently exclude large segments of the student popula tion. To address these issues, we put forth an innovative and novel pedagogical approach that attempts to capitalize better on the shared meanings between athlet ics and certain business practices. Using the sports of tennis and basketball, we demonstrate how sports metaphors can he responsibly used to aid in the under standing of business lessons, such as managerial decision making. © 2003, Sage Publications.

In recent years, the perspective of culture as an ongoing process responding to contextual forces has been widely embraced in the field. Acknowledging the dynamic nature of culture helps communicators make contextual evaluations in intercultural business communication practices. While researchers strive to examine the dynamic nature of culture and contextual factors' influence on culture and communication, little efforts has been made to examine the process of a cultural element's generation, development, and transmission. To understand the notion of culture as a dynamic process for effective intercultural business and technical practices, it is necessary to conceptualize or describe how a cultural element or unit originates and develops along an evolutionary path. In this study, we focus on how the online meme serves as an empirically useful unit of culture, explore an online meme's evolution process when it successfully transfers from an online marketplace to cultural space, and identify the qualities that constitute the success of the online meme. © The Author(s) 2015.""Do university writing experiences prepare students for future job-related writing tasks? If not, how can we create a smoother transition from the academy to the workplace? This article analyzes the differing discourse communities of academic writing and technical communication which may limit the transfer of skills from one arena to the next. The discussion considers the ways process, collaborative learning, writing across the curriculum, and language theories can form the foundation for constructive communication among disciplines. As the focus of academic writing moves from an emphasis on the individual to social context and wider audiences, it bridges the gap between disciplines and can ease the movement from the classroom to “real-world” settings. © 1993 IEEE""In this article, the first to analyze the role of analogy in Edward Thorndike's educational vision, I argue that the feat of Thorndike's analogy-making was his ability to launch an experimental science of child learning without having had access to children. That the origin of American pedagogical science rests on Thorndike's animals stands as a palpable example of the power of analogy to serve a constitutive function in scientific invention. In Thorndike's case, the social consequences were considerable: His juxtaposition of the child and the animal, his fusing of the two in the concept of the animal-child mind, led him to reason that infants, like animals, were incapable of having ideas, and children, though fully capable, still learned best in many cases through the process of rote memorization and drill. © 2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This study documents how the literature on group work supports my goals in the business communication classroom and how my experiment with group works proved to be successful. Students were grouped heterogeneously to expe rience the value of working with others and developing intercultural commu nication skills. Student statements and diaries showed that those who were afraid of being exploited or dominated by others in group work discovered the excitement of collaborative learning while exchanging ideas and helping or teaching each other. It was also observed that cultural and demographic differences tended to be eliminated during the interactions. © 1997, Sage Publications.

German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a stranger to the field, offers such a concept: responsibility. It covers more explanatory ground than the most cited of ethical concepts, deliberation, and most importantly, centers ethics and invention squarely within the technical communicator’s relationship to language. © 2017 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""One way to resolve some of the conflict in English studies and technical communication over their diminishing cultural capital is to recognize the place of instrumental discourse in communication studies. Instrumental discourse is individually verified social agreements to coordinate and control physical actions. One purpose of literary works is to voice new concerns about social inequities. A purpose of rhetoric is to persuade others of the validity of those concerns. Instrumental discourse registers agreements about those concerns and brings them to temporary closure in laws, instructions, contracts, and constitutions. Instrumental discourse is the culmination of a process that often begins with a literary monolog, is continued in many rhetorical dialogs, and ends, for a while, in a chorus of approval. Each phase of this communication process-monolog, dialog, and chorus-has a place in English studies. If more English studies faculty would recognize the need to study the communications that promote dissensus and consensus, then they might contribute more to global discussions about social justice, cooperation, and sustainability, and they might gain more cultural capital and social influence.""Tactical technical communication research suggests its application to social justice. However, beyond a general advocacy of anti-institutional activity, de Certeau’s notion of tactics provides no detailed ethical framework for ethically justifying tactics. In acknowledgement of this gap, this article foregrounds the ethical thought of feminist philosopher Adriana Cavarero, particularly her concept of vulnerability, as a supplement for those employing tactics for social justice causes.

The shift to sophisticated textual expression of accounting occurred as a result of the confluence of the rising English Renaissance trade economy, increasing literacy, and improving typography—all of which made the need for extensive financial records necessary and possible. The shift to a highly sophisticated textual/spatial presentation was nurtured by Ramism, Renaissance Italian art, and the rise of capitalism. Ultimately, this spatial presentation destroyed the oral-aural aspect of accounting. Spatial presentation was essential to the development of accounting techniques for an expanding economy, but spatial, rather than verbal, display led to abstraction in presentation that today makes accounting difficult for the nonaccounting reader to understand and for the expert accountant to verbalize. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Using one case of participatory design in urban planning, they suggest that planners struggled to effectively employ participatory design methodology because they neglected to collect the tacit knowledge generated through their participatory processes. Coupling participatory design with a listening rhetoric, they suggest that participatory processes that include tacit knowledge and representative citizen participation might augment public planning projects that hope for both big data collection and democratic approaches to urban planning. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.""Visual design has played an important role in the historical development of professional communication. The technology of laser printing has reestablished the importance of visual language in functional communication, transforming contemporary document design and redefining its relation to the traditions of handwritten, typewritten, and printed text. During this period of transition, three factors will shape the new visual language: (a) the development of a visual rhetoric that represents design as an integral part of the message rather than merely as external “dress,” (b) the rediscovery of aesthetics as a legitimate factor in text design, and (c) the use of empirical research—particularly context-specific research—to guide the document design process. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The chronological press book of copies of outgoing correspondence and the haphazardly arranged pigeonholes and boxes full of incoming correspondence could not handle the increasing amount of correspondence late in the nineteenth century. A series of changes in methods of producing and reproducing documents led up to the change in methods of storing and gaining access to them. The new vertical filing system affected the format and content of external correspondence and encouraged the evolution of inter- and intradepartmental correspondence. The changes in the communication structure in this period have implications for changes now in progress as office automation advances. © 1982, Sage Publications.

Hermetic texts, written in the early centuries A.D.., were based in experiential/ experimental knowledge of illiterate people and were written as recipes for manipulating nature. Set against the legitimate, text-based academic knowledge of the time, this proto-scientific knowledge was called ""secret"" to give it authority through revelation. In the mid-1500s, Agricola combined the traditions of Hermetic secrets and handbooks to compile mining lore into De Re Metallica, in which he sought to write clearly and simply, illustrate information with graphics, and rationalize the use of occult knowledge based on its utility. This early technical text paved the way for philosophers, such as Francis Bacon, to legitimate scientific knowledge based on experience/ experiments as being more ""beneficial"" for social organization than knowledge based on a priori textual authority and speculation in the then-dominant Scholastic tradition.""This essay explores the varied treatments introductions and conclusions receive in technical writing textbooks from the dual perspective of the students who must incorporate the advice into their work and the professors who must present the material to students. By focusing on specific techniques for generating clear, concise writing, by delineating methods of authorial analysis, and by offering student and professional examples of technical reports, the authors of these textbooks are successful when they tie the structure of introductions and conclusions closely to the context of the actual report. © 1990 IEEE""Work with structured abstracts - which contain sub-headings in a standard order - has suggested that such abstracts contain more information, are of a higher quality, and are easier to search and to read than are traditional abstracts. The aim of this article is to suggest that this work with structured abstracts can be extended to cover scientific articles as a whole. The article outlines a set of sub-headings - drawn from research on academic writing - that can be used to make the presentation of scientific papers easier to read and to write. Twenty published research papers are then analyzed in terms of these sub-headings.

The transfer or conduit model that the field has traditionally used to describe how communication occurs has, of course, determined what the field knows. An open systems model provides a new way of looking at the field, a lens that integrates concepts such as task, organizational structure, control, and technology into the analysis of written business messages. The article explores the influences these subsystems have on written communication and then develops these systems and subsystems into a series of business communication system maps. These maps or models can serve as springboards for additional research of on-the-job writing situations. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article describes the importance of annotation to reading and writing practices and reviews new technologies that complicate the ways annotation can be used to support and enhance traditional reading, writing, and collaboration processes. Important directions for future research are discussed, with emphasis on studying how professionals read and annotate, how readers might use annotations that have been produced by others, and how the interface of an annotation program affects collaboration and communication on revision. In each area, the authors emphasize issues and methods that will be productive for enhancing theories of workplace and classroom communication as well as implications for the optimal design of annotation technologies."Explores technologies and technical writing discussed in this journal over the past 50 years Describes how computer technologies were applied to gain efficiency in production Notes that single sourcing and content management focus on text creation"Presents the results of a qualitative study of the changing practice of technical communicators in North America Finds that the practice of technical communication is becoming more interactive and collaborative, and less solitary and textual.""In this study, I compared initial drafts of job application cover letters by nontraditional students in an introductory professional writing course with those by traditional students to determine if prior workplace experience improves rhetorical adaptability in students' writing. Although one might expect nontraditional students to display more rhetorical adaptability, this study reveals no difference. These results suggest that minor changes in pedagogy may help nontraditional students use their workplace experience to improve workplace-oriented writing in the classroom. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.""In this article, an educational project is described that was formulated with the aim to give master's students in business communication the opportunity to experience how theory could be applied to shape practice. A 4-week project was developed in which students were urged to use communication theory and linguistic theory to manage the communication with respect to a simulated crisis at the university. The students were enrolled in collaborative learning teams. In this article, the architecture of the project is described, and drawing on an analysis of the students' work and their evaluation of the project, its outcomes are discussed. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication."Strategic planning helps information-development organizations demonstrate their value and alignment with corporate objectives.  Use strategic planning to improve your organization and indicate your willingness to make quality and process improvements."Minutes of meetings, also called proceedings, records, and summaries, generally provide permanent documentation of significant statements and occurrences. The preparation of such minutes requires an experienced editor because they are frequently based on transcripts of meetings, and the development of minutes from transcripts demands specialized writing skills. The author draws upon her experience to outline the problems of translating transcripts to minutes and describes an effective approach to the task.""This paper investigates the reasons for the existing university-industry written communication gap and suggests ways for bridging it. Unfortunately, most university programs do not adequately help students with technical communications. Consequently, the new engineer, when hired, will have the burden of overcoming the gap of technical writing, apart from this other important engineering tasks. Therefore, industry and university should cooperate in helping new engineers with this important facet of their careers. A first action could be to supplement the college-level curriculum with courses on technical writing, documentation, editing, and the use of new communication systems based on real industry requirements. These courses that could continue in industry in the form of seminars, help from senior peers, and the publication department, along with personal efforts, would enable young engineers to comprehend the basic principles that help in writing effective reports and proposals in the real engineering world.""Proposes William Riker's heresthetic, or ""structuring the world so you can win,"" as a strategizing method* Suggests that this approach will better position technical communicators to succeed in the global information economy""This article discusses collaborative design in the context of developing a Toolbook hypertext intended to introduce graduate students to the fields of rhetoric and professional communication.

A systematic analysis of collaborative activities using a newly developed continuum shows that the writers' jobs were significantly transformed by the company's transition to a digital concept of writing. In particular, writers focused less on producing text and more on developing, coordinating, and structuring the newly adopted corporate intranet. © 2005 Sage Publications.""This paper reports the effectiveness of contemporary corporate annual report prose communication.

The survey questionnaire contained fourteen questions covering twelve survey topics. This article reports the findings of two survey topics: the components initially reviewed or read to determine whether to read a report in its entirety and the order in which report components are read. The questionnaire was submitted to 2 groups: internal (Langley) and external (non-Langley). Components most commonly used to review reports (combined surveys, descending order): Summary, Conclusion, Abstract, Title Page, Introduction. Order in which components are reviewed in deciding whether to read a report (weighted average ranking, combined surveys): Title Page, Abstract, Summary, Introduction, Conclusion.""Shows how a main document purpose may be decomposed into a hierarchical network containing sub-goals* Analyzes the multiple constraints that may be derived from different components of the functional context""Much business communication is directed to consumers-for example, contracts, warranties, directions, instructions, package labels, and package inserts. Consumers use these communications in different ways, and the usefulness of such documents cannot be evaluated by readability formulas or rating scales. This paper advocates that consumer communications be evaluated as to their usability, tested by consumers in actual use situations. As an illustration, testing of several versions of a consumer loan contract is demonstrated, in comparison to formula and rating scale evaluations. © 1983, Sage Publications.

(2) Explanation should be consciously generated and presented on two levels: general (macro) and specific (micro). Such presentation has at least two advantages: explanation on the general level ties the message to its wider con text or even with the human condition itself; explanation on the specific level connects it with the target's unique situation. © 1997, Sage Publications.

The authors investigate the discursive ways coding is downplayed within game design texts as a means of promoting design as a form of creative expression. This speaks to ongoing tension in the games industry of coding and technology versus art. The authors argue that, in their presentation of game design, leading textbooks attempt to frame the field as one of artistry and technical practice, presenting game design as a type of technical communication. The authors ultimately consider the potential and pitfalls of considering game design as a technical communication field and suggest that this framing presents lens for considering the recently professionalized field. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""The author uses game theoretical models to identify technical communication breakdowns encountered during the notoriously confusing Texas Two-Step voting and caucusing process. Specifically, the author uses narrative theory and game theory to highlight areas where caucus participants needed instructions to better understand the rules of the game and user analysis to better anticipate participants' motives and strategies. As a central tool of analysis, the author uses Nobel Laureate John C. Harsanyi's work on ""incomplete game"" or Bayesian games. The article demonstrates opportunities for technical communication scholars and teachers to use inter-disciplinary approaches to discover layers of technical communication in small group negotiations and to evaluate the layers of instructions and technologies needed to facilitate effective and ethical decision making in political caucusing. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Computer adventure games and operating systems have something in common: each presents to its players or users alien worlds that they can explore. The major difference between games and operating systems is in the way they communicate with people; operating systems tend to communicate poorly, while adventure games communicate so well that players need minimal introductory or reference documentation. What is it about adventure games that fosters ease of use? How might those techniques be applied to the design of operating system interfaces? The author offers answers for both questions.""Interest in gamification in higher education has been growing steadily in the past decade. Using games and game elements has been shown to increase student engagement, motivation, and autonomy. This article draws parallels between game elements, instructional design, and the teaching of business and professional communication. It suggests ways that teachers can incorporate game elements into their courses (or perhaps identifies ways in which readers are already doing so without realizing it). The article concludes with an example of how game elements are used in the design of an introductory business communication course. © 2017 by the Association for Business Communication."Receiving innovative end-user feedback on an information system is essential for acquiring further development ideas. The feedback gathering method should encourage end users to freely bring out new ideas. The method should be repeatable and transferable to allow its use in various contexts. We employ the principles of collaboration engineering using so-called thinkLets as building blocks to construct a feedback gathering process. We apply the principles for receiving new development ideas for a multi-university student information system in Finland. We reflect on the experiences and give insights on applying two alternative processes in a complex organizational context. © 2005 IEEE."This study gauges workers’ degree of openness to significant changes in the organization, style, and design of a written report by analyzing metaphors that emerge from their talk about their report-reading and decision-making tasks. Workers at two work sites—in Maryland and in Washington DC—responded to two typical work reports: one written in the style currently in use and another in a fundamentally different style exhibiting features that make documents easy to read and understand. The dominant metaphor that the Maryland workers used was “the whole-man” approach, which represented the workers’ flexible approach toward work tasks that resulted in their willingness to accept the fundamentally different report. In contrast, Washington DC workers used the metaphors “paint by the numbers” and “stay within the lines” when describing their work. These metaphors suggest the workers’ adherence to organizational routines and uncomfortableness with change that caused them not only to reject the new reports but also to have strong emotional reactions toward them. These results indicate that assessing organizational talk, particularly the metaphors people use, is a useful tool in gauging workers’ perceptions about and degree of openness toward communication change. © The Author(s) 2014.""Although handbooks (those often used as references in business and industry) tend to adhere to traditional usage prescriptions, it is clear that they cannot possibly all display the same degree of prescriptivism. Likewise, people who select handbooks, whether they are writing instructors or professional writers, differ in how much importance they invest in following traditional prescriptions. What is needed, then, is a method to match handbooks to users, enabling writingprofessionals to select a reference that reflects their views on the importance of adhering to traditional rules. Toward this end, this article describes a study of the level of prescriptiveness of 14 handbooks and provides a method based on this study for gauging the prescriptiveness of other handbooks. This study supports W.E. Meyers' (1995) findings in that it suggests prescriptive usage entries are still prevalent in handbooks. However, handbooks do display some variation in their prescriptiveness, and their prescriptiveness can be gauged by analyzing a sample of ten usage items.""A review of communication-productivity research shows a noticeable lack in focus upon a possible connection between “formal communication” and productivity. The authors suggest that: (1) Pure influences of formal communication exist only indirectly through selected intervening variables. (2) Healthy informal channels of communication work in conjunction with carefully structured formal channels to affect employee productivity. (3) It may be necessary in future employee studies to distinguish between the Universe of Managerial Communication, informal communication, and formal communication. (4) For directors of communication who find themselves having to justify formal communication programs, attention to the intervening variables of information dissemination and goal clarifica tion as they affect employee performance may prove useful as evidence of program effectiveness. © 1982, Sage Publications.

In this study, the authors define three collaborative modes: dialogic, asymmetrical, and hierarchical. Dialogic and asymmetrical modes are emancipating and characterized by flexibility, open-ended inquiry, and concern for the growth and development of the individuals involved. Hierarchical modes are oppressive and are characterized by rigidity and suppression of the voices of others in the group. Two collaborative writing groups in a chemical engineering design course exemplify these modes. The first, composed of two women and two men, was primarily dialogic, and the second, composed of two women and three men, exhibited characteristics of all three modes. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

However, this perspective can lead to stereotypes that limit the range of interactional strategies open to individuals. This article profiles two women from student engineering teams who participated in a study on collaboration and the role of gender. The study, which used a qualitative approach to data collection and analysis, showed that men and women alike displayed both gender-linked and non-gender-linked behavior. It also showed that successful collaboration was influenced less by gender and more by such factors as a strong work ethic, team commitment, and effective leadership.""Drawing on recent studies of visual design and current feminist theory, and based on a research project in which males and females were asked to create visual representations of factual information, a feminist theory of design is posited. Three primary positions relevant for technical communicators are argued: 1) social contructionism is a feminist perspective; 2) technical communicators need to eliminate the hierarchy of visuals and text and represent information by balancing both; and 3) technical communicators need to emphasize the rhetorical, contextual situations in which visuals and texts co-mingle. © 1992 IEEE""The literature on gender differences in managerial communications is strongly influenced by folk-linguistics. This study used written managerial communications to test the quality and stylistic differences purported to exist between genders. The gender of the sender and the receiver did not have a significant effect on the style or quality of written communications. Differences in communication styles between men and women may be limited to verbal and nonverbal communication. © 1986, Sage Publications.

Specific issues affecting our profession, our research, and our pedagogical philosophies and assignments are presented. The article addresses the consequences of the feminization of technical communication, the avenues for research on gender differences in communication—specifically those differences that affect technical communicators—and the means for encouraging a more gender-balanced view of business and industry within our technical communication classrooms by giving students a chance to practice writing about gender-related issues. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Parity indices were com puted to relate male/female representation in the reports to male/female re presentation in the labor force. The parity indices were correlated with report readers’ perceptions of corporate climate, measured by a nine-item Likert type scale. Perceptions of corporate climate bore little relationship to male representation in the annual reports. However, as visibility of females in creased, participants tended to rate corporate climate more favorably. © 1988, Sage Publications.

In these textbooks women are portrayed as subservient, emotional, and frivolous. Men, on the other hand, are portrayed as decisive, logical, and strong. These stereotype-based scripts suggest that men are more suited than women for positions of authority within the business world and have played an important role in relegating women to low-level positions. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Through a semiotic analysis, we examine medical illustrations explicitly tied to female bodies—anatomical illustrations of female genitalia, a clitorectomy, and a hymenectomy—to show that the ways in which a body or surgical procedure was visually represented served to create the “other.” We learn, by extension, how social and political ideologies affect the decision-making of modern-day technical communicators. © 1995 IEEE.""The article discusses gender bias in employment interviewing. Candidates for employment are likely to modify expectations and behaviors in order to fit the organization's model and the employment interview is likely to reproduce organizational practices, despite changing societal norms outside the workplace.

It requires that the writer be adept in accurately using the language of his/her discipline and takes care in considering the unique characteristics of the document's audience and how they are likely to interpret the message. When writers fail in these areas, the consequences can be very serious as demonstrated by General Ambrose Burnside's orders for the Battle of Fredericksburg during the Civil War.""In scientific and technical communication, intelligibility is primarily a cultural problem, to which carefully formulated generalization, rather than streams of data, are the ony solution. Preoccupation with simplicity, or clarity, or ″correctness″ is a poor substitute for a careful consideration of what the reader can and cannot be expected to understand. The writer who will overcome his prejudices against generalization in order to convey the concepts which his reader does not share with him should be able to communicate more effectively to this fellow specialists, to specialists in other fields, and to concerned laymen.""In a proposal effort, those who make the bid/no-bid decision need early information about the technical approach to the project they may want to propose. The scientists and engineers who develop this technical approach usually can talk about their plans much sooner than they can write about them. When a team is addressing a request for proposal, one of the earliest events is an oral presentation on the technical approach to the project. The presentation is video- or audio-taped, the tapes are transcribed and edited on a word processor, and the transcripts are developed and revised further by the proposal manager, the authors, and the editors. The strategy not only helps engineers and scientists produce a very quick but respectable first draft for their work on a proposal, but also proves effective for generating other documents and even helps authors and editors interact more cooperatively and constructively.

We developed the construct use richness as a measure of the extent to which users use the media communication capacity after adoption and proposed a conceptual model of the antecedents of use richness. Through a field survey with 272 valid responses and structural equation modeling, we empirically tested our model and found that use richness is positively affected by perceived media richness, perceived usefulness, and perceived social usefulness. © 2010 IEEE.""Employing the feminist interpretive focus group method, findings in this study demonstrate how different generational perspectives of professional women, socialized at different periods of time, intersect in the current workforce to explain conflict around work and life. In particular, the authors found conflict centers around two well-documented discourses thematic in their focus groups, which organize the way people think about work-paying one's dues and face-time. Using interpretive focus groups to draw out the different interpretive frames of the generations, this study deconstructs the interpretations, providing a hopeful place to begin a theoretical and practical conversation that bridges the different perspectives of women across generations as they negotiate work and life. Findings have implications for organizational, work/life, and qualitative communication studies. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article analyzes the Web interfaces of two well-known national civic action groups, both related to genetics research: the Genetic Alliance and the Innocence Project. These two sites are excellent examples of interface design and information retrieval, and they also attempt to translate complex science to the general public, even those traditionally most underrepresented and marginalized by the complexities of science and technology. The Genetic Alliance and Innocence Project provide excellent case studies for technical communication courses about the necessity to marry factual scientific knowledge with cultural and emotional rhetorics while providing an interface for multiple stakeholders in public policy change. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""The study reported on in this article analyzes the U.K. Operating and Financial Review (OFR) as a genre of accounting narrative, employing word frequencies to identify genre rules. Evidence is found of rhetorical ploys within the genre and of differences in word frequencies, suggesting the existence of subgenres, related to the exigencies of the rhetorical situation. The genre employs language biased toward the positive (the ""Pollyanna effect""), despite authoritative guidance that the OFR should be expressed in neutral terms. Evidence of subgenres includes differential propensity to employ positive language and differences in the rhetorical ploys adopted in connection with marketing strategy, corporate recovery, self-reference, comparative analysis, and gearing (leverage). The study also demonstrates the value of a corpus linguistics approach in analyzing accounting narratives. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Carolyn Miller's definition of genre as ""social action"" has become widely accepted in writing studies; this acceptance has prompted troubling questions about the teaching of professional genres. Because current research emphasizes Miller's reconceptualization of ""exigence"" as a socially construed need for particular kinds of writing and talk (155-58), some researchers now suggest that unless a genre's social exigence can be fully replicated in the classroom, the genre cannot be taught effectively. Genres, however, entail several kinds of exigence: social exigence that prompts generic writing; social exigence that is reflected in the generic text; textual exigence that shapes the rhetorical situation; and what I call educational exigence, an exigence that prompts writers to learn explicitly how to compose generic texts. Educational exigence was evident in the writing processes of two technical translators who composed in a variety of genres, both familiar and unfamiliar to them. The translators not only responded to educational exigence but also followed a well-considered strategy for gathering information about generic texts.""Based on a study of nearly 200 international faculty in the field of computer science and computer engineering, roughly 90 written genres in the computing discipline are identified and organized according to five central aims in the profession: generation, procuration, dissemination, evaluation, and regulation. The importance of writing in the field is discussed, and recommendations for further research follow to encourage greater breadth and depth in the identification and study of generic corpora characteristic of specific professional communities. Benefits of such research assist students preparing to enter a profession, working professionals wishing to improve their writing in a profession, and writing specialists who offer training or editorial services for a profession.""Recent years have seen increased attention to the examination of the genres that people use in professional communication. C. Berkenkotter and T.N. Huckin's book ""Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication"" (1995) is an important contribution to this discussion. Their view of genre has important implications for the teaching of professional writing. Their view gives us an insight into the ways in which people both acquire and use genre knowledge as they participate in the knowledge-producing activities of their field or profession. It shows us how important the process of genre acquisition is in the learning of disciplinary genre knowledge. Linguistic knowledge is necessary for effective communication, but it is not sufficient for writers to achieve their goals. Just as important, writers need to understand the underlying views, assumptions and aims of a field. They need control of the rhetoric through which they are expressed. They also need to understand the history, knowledge and expectations of their particular area, and to locate their writing clearly within the context of this work. The notion of genrecan provide students with the tools for both recognizing and adapting to the changing genre landscapes that their professional lives will travel across. While we cannot hope to predict all of our students' possible future genre needs, we can help them ask questions of texts, of contexts, and of themselves, so they can produce and understand the kinds of texts which they need to control in their professional lives.""This article modifies and elaborates the language-based communication zones model. The authors distinguish between potential zones and activated zones, add MegaZone Two and MegaZone Three to the model, define language competency more completely and precisely, and identify three types of genre patterns (i.e., professional genre, commercial genre, and relational genre). Concentrating on the language patterns in the direct channels of language-based communication zones, they focus on determining the language competencies required to communicate directly in different communication situations and about different communication tasks. Professional, commercial, and relational genre patterns in Zone One, MegaZone Two, and MegaZone Three are identified and described. Research-based examples are included to illustrate the genre patterns. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article explores the value of rhetorical genre theory for health care and professional communication researchers. The authors outline the conceptual resources emerging from genre theory, specifically ways to conceptualize social context, professional identity formation, and genres as functioning but hierarchical networks, and discuss the way they have used these resources in two separate but complementary health-care studies: a project that documents the ways regulated and regularized resources of the genre of case presentations shape the professional identity formation of medical students and a project that extends this theoretical work to observe that genres, especially policy genres, function to regularize or control other genres and shape the identity formation of midwives in Ontario, Canada. The authors also observe that the implications of rhetorical genre theory have impelled both of these studies to develop an interdisciplinary trajectory that includes members of health-care communities as participating researchers. © 2005 Sage Publications.""This article examines the characteristics of collaborative work and overlapping activity systems in the popular online game World of Warcraft. Using genre theory and activity theory as frames to work out the genre ecology of gameplay, the article focuses on how players coordinate ad hoc grouping activity across and through genres. It articulates the related development of open systems in online gaming in a discussion of interface modifications (AddOns) and online information databases that players generate, drawing on De Certeau's formulation of strategies and tactics and Warner's discussion of publics and counterpublics. The article concludes by discussing implications of online gaming for an open-systems approach to information design in professional communication and for professional communication in general. © 2009 Sage Publications.""Analytical reports, being one of the most difficult genres to teach in a technical writing course, are best taught through the ""open case"" method. Open cases take advantage of the fact that students are already situated in a workplace environment, the college campus. Engineering students can use the genre to impose order on this chaotic environment, conducting various forms of research on engineering-related campus issues. A process for developing open case assignments is provided.""This article examines the processes involved in the production and pitching of press releases and considers the demands that these make on PR practitioners, particularly newcomers to the industry. The study tracks the course of events as a PR company undertook a promotional brief, using as its central source of data a daily journal written by an intern who was closely involved in the process. Three pivotal cycles of activity, each constructed by means of a cluster of satellite genres and activities, contributed to the overall process: brainstorming, writing the press release itself, and media-pitching. The findings show the ways in which the goals of the PR organization under study were achieved by means of a complex, dynamic, collaboratively constructed, and intertextually linked genre system. It is suggested that becoming a successful PR practitioner involves learning how to manage an interconnected process that is constantly evolving, and how to rework and repackage information for different audiences. © The Author(s) 2014.""This study examines the global-local interplay of genre features in a select sample of nonprofit grant proposals from two particular sites - Nepal and the United States. Critically analyzing the carefully selected samples from both the sites on their own terms first and then in clusters (of Nepalese and American proposals) by exploiting the genre and discourse analysis theories and techniques published in genre, genre analysis, and grant proposal scholarship, this study attempts to examine the genre of nonprofit grant proposal in both comparative and non-comparative terms. While the study acknowledges that each instance of nonprofit grant proposal is unique, complex, and therefore non-generalizable, it does draw some broad generalizations about the similarities and differences in the rhetorical ""moves,"" organization, and/or composition strategies of grant writers from these two different geopolitical locations. The study finds that variations observed across samples and grant writers reflect the unique rhetorical situations of these writers, whereas uniformities have to do with the global circulation of Western genre forms in the rest of the world via global organizations like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund - which are also the major donors in developing countries like Nepal. And finally, the study reaffirms the fact that constraints like funding agencies' guidelines and reviewers' preferences have a considerable influence on genre features and forms. That has been the case with both the Nepalese and American proposals sampled in this study. © 2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article seeks to identify Carver's achievements as a technical communicator through a brief analysis of some of the technical bulletins he wrote while directing the Agricultural Experiment Station at Tuskegee Institute. The author mentions Carver's attention to problem-solving, his historical consciousness, his championing of the potential of his region, and his recognition of the interface of science, technology, and the humanities, and makes the point that these aspects of Carver's technical communication lift his work above the common requirements of good technical writing. In other words, while each of Carver's technical bulletins fulfills its basic communicative task, each also reflects the sense of mission that he felt for his work - a distinct, yet somewhat mystical, belief that what he had to say to the farmers of Macon County - and the world - must be heard and must be understood.""This article describes German correspondence styles in order to assist American managers. In the coming years, more and more American managers will find that they must correspond with their German counterparts either as colleagues within international organizations or as associates representing collaborative and competing businesses.

The assignment has several advantages: it gradually introduces students to the means of shaping material to meet reader needs by allowing the student to deal with only one reader at a time; it allows students to write about material they already know; it shows the instructor how effective his initial audience instruction has been; it gives the instructor the opportunity to show how definition is related to audience analysis; and it provides a means of developing and integrating several other writing projects which use this assignment as a basis."This philosophical article explores individuality and innovation (creating new technology) as they relate to the communication approaches of scientists, engineers, and technologists. I suggest that effective communication between technical and non-technical people is difficult because technical communication lacks humanity, a personal dimension. I also suggest that dimension is lacking because technical people give up their identity to be considered competent and I argue that a different approach to communication education for scientists, engineers, and technologists is required to equip them with requisite communication skills to make their personal contribution to successful innovation. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This paper describes a project incorporating writing-to-learn activities into an introductory finance class. Such activities use writing informally as a vehicle to promote student learning. Examination of the students' brief papers showed that students became less likely to skip theory and go to canned formulas and that they took more responsibil ity for their work. For instructors, the project was beneficial because it enabled them to tailor class presentations more precisely to students' actual comprehension of course material. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Participants can prepare for a seminar by (1) setting objectives for attending, (2) assessing their attitudes and beliefs relevant to the subject, and (3) formulating strategies for listening to and seeking needed information. Testing the effectiveness of seminar attendance requires enacting the objectives and summarizing the information obtained.""Building on student and faculty enthusiasm for Web resources, we addressed four significant questions as we revised a business communications class to incorporate the Internet: • What Web resources should we include? • How do we make sure we select high quality sites and assessment tools? • How do we effectively integrate Web tools with existing pedagogies? • Will students find Web assignments valuable, easy to access, and useful for course assignments? We integrated Web resources with other course pedagogies in the undergraduate business communications class and identified Websites relevant for teaching employment communication, including e-mail etiquette, online resumes, and elec tronic job searches. Student evaluations of our Web-enhanced course indicate that most found the Web-based assessments and tools accessible and valuable in fur thering their self-understanding and in leading them to explore other sites not required for class. We developed guidelines for using the new technology to support teaching and learning strategies. © 2001, Sage Publications.

This article examines characterization in the context of corporate communication, interweaving an interview with veteran executive speechwriter Alan Perlman with accounts from the ancient rhetorical tradition. As the analysis shows, Perlmana's approach to characterization confirms long-standing rhetorical wisdom yet incorporates insights that reflect the contemporary corporate context in which he has worked. The analysis also calls attention to enduring tensions in characterizationa-tensions between imitation and representation, effectiveness and ethics, and dramatic character and trustworthy ethos."Describes attempts to define a controlled French  Argues that this controlled French allows easy translation of technical documentation into Simplified English and improves readability for native French speakers."This article reviews recent research in linguistics and psychology and suggests some ways this research can inform teachers of technical writing. Primarily, it considers investigations of the given/new contract and cohesion. The given/new contract is a tacit agreement between writers and readers that dictates the available means for connecting previously unfamiliar (new) information to known (given) information. It requires writers to insure that readers can infer appropriate connections or to specify these connections by supplying direct antecedents for information assumed as given. In the second case, the connection between an antecedent and its dependent given is cohesive. Violations of the given/new contract decrease the readability of a text. These violations occur when writers place given and new information improperly in related sentences or when they attempt to combine unrelated, frequently undeveloped, ideas in the same paragraph.""Associations between three types of feedback content and three appraisal outcomes were examined for two managerial levels. Results showed that performance improve ment emphasis, corporate goal emphasis, and salary information each played some role in enhancing motivation and appraisal objectivity for both groups. However, sig nificantly higher correlations were found for middle than for upper-level managers on three relationships: Performance improvement emphasis—appraisal objectivity, perfor mance improvement emphasis—personal goal instrumentality, and corporate goal emphasis—personal goal instrumentality. These results seem to be consequences of middle managers'greater needs for clarification of performance goal bases, perfor mance expectations, and reward contingencies. © 1992, Sage Publications.

Benefits include preparing students for the workplace by immersing them in intercultural projects and increasing the complexity of their understanding of the global economy. Challenges can range from technological constraints and scarce resources to geopolitical factors and varying disciplinary norms. However, global partnerships make faculty and students more aware of and engaged in the global business environment as they learn to communicate more effectively across cultures, critique current business practices, and produce new ways of being in global relation to each other. An interinstitutional partnership between a U.S. university and Universidad de la Habana in Cuba forms the centerpiece of discussion. Outcomes of this partnership include coauthoring articles in both countries and languages, the creation of a business communication course for graduate students in Cuba, and the development of classroom activities in which selected U.S. and Cuban undergraduate students exchange business documents. © 2004, Sage Publications.

Research questions: What role do trust and team cohesion play in the relationship between coordination effectiveness and team performance of global virtual teams with two distinct subgroups? Literature review: Prior research suggests that coordination effectiveness on team performance is most strongly impacted by coordination of knowledge. This effectiveness is mediated by trust and team cohesion. However, we have a poor understanding of trust and team cohesion dynamics on intergroup relationships in global virtual teams. Methodology: A survey was conducted with 14 teams with a total of 112 participants in the US and India. The teams were tasked with evaluating customer-relationship-management best practices for a global environment. Results and discussion: We evaluated how the process of effective coordination for teams composed of two colocated subgroups is mediated by individual perceptions of out-group trust and overall team cohesion. Our findings show that individual trust and team cohesion share a reciprocal impact on each other, suggesting that effective coordination in virtual teams can create a positive feedback loop with trust and cohesion, improving overall project performance. Implications for theory and practice include the virtuous cycle that trust and cohesion create in global virtual team coordination and the necessity of establishing appropriate project coordination systems and processes to promote both aspects and, thus, achieve excellent project performance for colocated subgroups. © 2016 IEEE.""This paper analyzes texts published by ExxonMobil on the issue of climate change by employing the related, yet distinct methods that have evolved under the rubric of rhetorical analysis and discourse analysis, as influenced by concepts from Kenneth Burke and Michel Foucault, respectively. My purpose is to compare these two approaches to show their uses and potential value in business communication research. I show how both reveal the socially constructed nature of ""reality"" and the social effects of language, but are nevertheless distinct in their emphases. For the rhetorical critic, the analytic interest is in the purposeful acts of the language user and the ethical effects of language use. Rhetorical criticism thus considers the devices by which texts frame meaning, create understanding, and promote (or fail to promote) identification between rhetor and audience, thus facilitating co-operative action. The Foucauldian approach, by contrast, focuses on the interplay of texts (intertextuality) and discourses (interdiscursivity) in order to illuminate the nature of socio-political struggle and show the relationship between texts and macro-sociological issues. These alternative methodological approaches offer the business communication researcher complementary means by which to illuminate the role of corporate public discourse in maintaining organizational legitimacy and influencing social and institutional stability and change. © 2002 by the Association for Business Communication.""Recounts a technical writing institute presented by a delegation of technical communication faculty to China.

Yet evidence of writing competency is not universally considered for admission to MBA programs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between the Analytical Writing Assessment Section (AWA) of the GMAT exam and a ""critical thinking"" writing assignment that is similar to the AWA. Results indicate that the AWA is significantly correlated with achievement, not only on the writing assignment but also with the final grade in a managerial communication course. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication."Discusses the potential of goal-based scenarios as an approach to designing online learning environments Explores practical applications of goal-based scenarios for online training Presents a procedural approach to designing a goal-based scenario"This paper opens with a summary of minimalist design strategies that aim to optimize user instructions. Next, it discusses three recent research efforts to further improve these strategies. The common focus in these efforts is the attention to people's goal-related management and control of attention, time, and effort. First, a comprehensive framework for designing procedures-the Four Components model-is described. The design principles for the goal component focus on supporting the user's goal orientation and goal setting. Second, two experiments are reported that studied the problem of when it is best to present conceptual information. When instructions employed a learning-by-doing approach, users clearly preferred a work-flow mode of presentation. This mode optimally exploits the user's momentary interest in conceptual information during goal-driven task execution. The third research effort concentrates on user affect in instructions. The main idea is that motivation and emotion play a key role in task appraisals and corresponding actions. After discussing theories and design approaches, an experiment is discussed in which instructions were optimized for affect. Good results for perceived relevance and self-confidence were found in all conditions. Presence of an affect-oriented co-user did not enhance these effects. The paper concludes that the contribution of the efforts extends beyond the minimalist framework from which they originated. © 2007 IEEE.""As we have seen from this illustration of the use of CBO as a consulting technique, CBO is designed to enhance executive awareness of the need for feedback by incorporating feedback as an element of its plan, thus compensating for what Argyris claims is the lack of awareness among executives of the negative impact their behavior has on others. The CBO approach will enable an executive to become less predictable and mechanical in his responses as well as to problem-solve more comprehensively without significantly increasing the amount of time he devotes to decision-making. It is, in other terms, a focused communication approach that integrates what an executive will communicate about a problem into the actual process of decision-making. The intent of CBO is not to reinforce an old leadership style but to permit an executive to break through predictability (which often represents mere circularity in his thinking) so that he can reach innovative and yet more clearly targeted conclusions. CBO can, as well, prevent the problems of “dog eat dog” communication, intergroup rivalries, and communication bypassing in middle management. Working toward negotiated solutions, it requires each party in an interaction to think through a problem in terms of the other party's objectives and the strategies and tactics he must himself use to overcome them. Finally, CBO accounts for what 74 percent of Argyris middle management sample considered its single worst problem: overload.? The ability of CBO to cut through interactions to achieve less protracted and more clearly focused interactions not only increases the productivity of time spent on a problem but eliminates much of the time that is wasted. © 1984, Sage Publications.

The same advice can readily be given to technical writers and editors who may occasionally struggle to adapt the writing of nonnative speaking (NNS) engineers, researchers, and programmers to style book norms. This approach certainly applies to those of us who work with or manage NNS colleagues. Although addressed to language teachers, the author considers how Cook's observations have validity for many workplace interactions in the growing international community.""When the primary aim of global, professional communication expands to include rapport building in addition to information sharing, basic parts of the communication process must be reevaluated. Such an assessment was conducted through a case study of a team that adapted a US training seminar for a Japanese audience. The team's strong emphasis on the communicative aim of relationship building illustrated how traditional conceptions of rhetorical invention, packaging, delivery, and feedback collection might be revised. For practitioners and educators, the findings of this case study prompt a reevaluation of the rhetorical abilities that are required in global professional communication contexts. © 2009 IEEE.""Explains why technical communicators should help translators and offers tips for creating ""translation-friendly"" documentation  Describes a research and design process for creating an online tutorial on writing and designing for translation.""This paper outlines six stages of the position candidate interview process: preparation, the first few minutes, setting the structure, information-gathering, selling the position and company, and the close.

Several suggestions are given for becoming a more effective speaker.""Teaching of writing is the province of the writing teacher-of course. But ABCA President Knapper believes that if colleges and universities are to teach writing effectively, teachers of all subject matters will need to get in on that act.

And this cannot be done without a shared com mitment and a shared responsibility on the part of the entire facutly. © 1978, Sage Publications.

Two hundred fifty-five graduate business students who had taken a core course in managerial communication were surveyed, 86% of whom are employed. The most highly rated course topics were making presentations, writing memos and letters, listening and interpersonal communication, impromptu speaking, and business report formats. The topics rated least important were international business communication, using technology, and managing diversity. The most frequently suggested additional topics were job interviews, team building, writing manuals/policies/procedures, and ethics. © by the Association for Business Communication.""To address graduate writing pedagogy in technical communication, this article reports on a study of 14 award-winning dissertations in the field.

It is important, therefore, that recruitment advertisements attract the attention of potential applicants and encourage them to apply. The purpose of this study was to examine the variables that influence attention to advertisements and the intention to apply for advertised positions among final-year commerce students. A quasi-experiment was conducted to investigate the relative impact of three factors in a recruitment advertisement: the use of the word graduate in the heading, the use of pictures in the advertisement, and the mention of a career path or opportunities for development and promotion. The results highlight the importance of a heading with the word graduate and support a proposed three-step model for designing a recruitment advertisement. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper discusses grammar errors and style weaknesses identified by CRITIQUE, a text processing system developed at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Linguistic criteria for distinguishing between grammar and style are drawn first. These criteria are reflected in the messages issued by CRITIQUE to the user. Then, a computational criterion for distinguishing between grammar and style is discussed. This criterion is reflected in the implementation of the grammar- and style-checking mechanisms. Finally, it is explained how CRITIQUE operates when the criteria are in conflict: the implementation is driven by the computational criterion, while the display to the user remains faithful to the linguistic criteria. © 1988 IEEE""A survey-experiment at the University of Leeds, England, attempted to resolve two questions: (1) Are some grammatical structures more efficient than others in communicating scientific fact? and (2) Do students pursuing different academic disciplines have correspondingly different value systems with regard to technical writing and technical subject matter? The results of the survey, which sampled 300 students, indicated yes to both questions. Particularly ironic was the finding that the third-person passive voice, so commonly the style of twentieth-century technical English, is disadvantageous from a communication standpoint.""In this potentially controversial article, the author expresses grave concerns about Grammatik 5 for Windows, both as a teaching tool and as a subtle means of propagating a political perspective.

These nomograms provide quick and direct determination of readability scores, eliminating numerical calculation. Flesch's and Gunning's methods were chosen because they are the oldest and probably the most popular readability formulas. The nomograms were constructed from the equations Reading Ease (R. E. ) equals 206. 835 - 0. 846wl - 1. 015sl and Fog Index (F. I. ) equals 0. 4 (sl plus lw), where-in a 100-word sample-wl is the number of syllables, sl is the average number of words per sentence, and lw is the number of words having more than two syllables (not counting simple compound words like ″butterfly″ ).

Despite potential benefits, little research has examined the merits of the graphic novel approach. In response, we engage in a two-study approach. Study 1 explores the potential of graphic novels to affect learning outcomes and finds that the graphic novel was related to high levels of learning experiences. Study 2 compares the impact of graphic novels with that of traditional textbooks and finds that verbatim recognition was superior with graphic novel texts.

Comparison of graphics between the two journals shows sharp differences in terms of range of graphics types, visual consistency within and between articles, or use of color. As the articles take into account what is needed by different audiences, the graphics help to build the credibility of the journal. The study also addresses the question of how scientific visuals contribute to the persuasiveness of a writer, looking at how the graphics within an article affect the credibility or ethos of the writer.""Reports on the use of graphics by engineers as a method of stimulating the writing process Shows that graphics have a powerful function in stimulating writing ideas Describes patterns in graphics types based on the genre, and the most common types used.""Training for the Telephone Office Planning and Engineering System (TOPES) is provided in the Bell System by graphics-based programmed instructions.

Each page of the book contains a few terse statements that direct action at the keyboard, cursor, and display screen, and a short description of how TOPES responds. On the lower half of each page is a photographic reproduction of the graphics that should appear on the screen. By following the instructions the user becomes familiar with most TOPES conventions and commands, and creates charts, drawings, and plans that can serve as examples for future work. Although it is typical to provide personalized instruction for operators of complex computer graphics systems, this has been found to be unnecessary for TOPES.""This article examines the development of graphs and charts as managerial tools at the beginning of the twentieth century, using Du Pont as a case study The evolution of graphic business tools was a result of two things. I) business's need for methods of analyzing and communicating data rapidly in the years of business growth and development at the beginning of the century, and 2) a growing general understanding of the capabilities of graphs Du Pont's chart room, developed less than twenty years after graphs were first introduced into the company, succeeded spectacularly in suiting the graphic medium to the company's executive needs as it developed from one organizational structure to another.

Yet constructivist theory implies that usability cannot be located in a single artifact; rather, it must be conceived as a quality of the entire activity in which the artifact is used. This article describes a distributed approach to usability, based on activity theory and genre theory. It then illustrates the approach with a four-decade examination of a traffic accident location and analysis system (ALAS). Using the theoretical framework of genre ecologies, the article demonstrates how usability is distributed across the many official and unofficial (ad hoc) genres employed by ALAS users.""The population of older adults is growing rapidly worldwide, but technical communicators have not accounted for the needs of these audiences, nor drawn from the wide range of research on aging.

Business managers, seeking more efficient and effective methods of managing diverse contributions, have increasingly used information technology to support group work. The same need to improve group communication is relevant to today's classroom, where new technologies can transform the classroom from a traditional instructor-centered environment to a student-centered environment where students actively participate in intellectual discourse. Results from field and laboratory studies about business usage of electronic meeting systems (EMS) can be applied to the classroom setting. We offer an overview of available tools and suggest some classroom activities. EMS-supported courses provide many new opportunities to foster learning. Students participate, participate more equally, and report a highly satisfying experience.""Understanding student perceptions of group work should help educators prepare students to be effective group members in the classroom and at work. This study ascer tained student perceptions of their learning and achievement in group situations. The following correlations were determined: (a) There was a relationship between student grades and perceptions of the writing quality as well as perceptions of the amount learned about group processes; (b) there was no correlation between grades and student opinions of the quantity of work achieved, the type of person who hindered the group the most, and whether the student enjoyed the group work. © 1995, Sage Publications.

This study examines a classroom application of groupware for computer-supported cooperative work, consisting of problem solving, decision making, and development of group reports. Survey results indicate that student groupware users are generally sat isfied with member contributions and group output but are less satisfied with software-supported, decision-making processes. The study suggests that group ware is a powerful communication tool for support of work groups but that it may not, in itself, solve the basic problems of getting people to work together effectively and productively.""In my 1992 College English article ""The Ethic of Expediency: Classical Rhetoric, Technology, and the Holocaust"" [1], I looked at the implications of a Nazi memo whose sole purpose was to improve the efficiency of the gassing vans, in order to begin to try to understand and discuss the negative uses and ethical abuses to which technical communication, and deliberative rhetoric generally, could be taken by the powerful and unscrupulous. In ""Questioning the Motives of Technical Communication and Rhetoric: Steven Katz's 'Ethic of Expediency'"" [2], Patrick Moore accuses me of ignoring alternate translations, citing out of context, and focusing on the negative meaning of words to make my case. The point at issue in these charges, I believe, is whether (and to what degree) Aristotle meant to base deliberative discourse on ""expediency."" I will take each of these charges up one at a time to explore them more thoroughly, discuss their interrelations, and then conclude with a few observations of my own.""Data displayed in a chart rather than a table are easier to understand and trends or patterns are easier to identify.

Each cultural group possesses a deeply embedded “silent lan guage” that requires attention and provides communication challenges. In the busi ness of health care, this silent language can create tremendous challenges for the physician/patient communication process, especially when the physician and patient come from starkly different cultural backgrounds, an increasingly common scenario. Through focus groups with recent Vietnamese immigrants, we identified three salient factors in this silent language: cultural health beliefs, time orientation, and the expected role of family members in the practice of health care.

The runs have been carried out for inlet temperatures of solids of about 693 and 1123 K. Influence of the gas-to-solid heat-capacity-ratio and of the temperature on the efficiencies of heat utilization of solids and gas and on the overall efficiency have been investigated. A model taking into account these phenomena has been derived and tested.An experimental study of heat transfer between a surface and a fluidized bed operating at pressures up to 8. 1 MPa has been performed. The observed rise in heat transfer coefficient with pressure is mainly attributed to a better hydrodynamic situation at the heat transfer surface in the case of small particles and an increase of the convective component of heat transfer in the case of large particles.Measurements are reported for the extent of the splash zone and for corresponding tube heat transfer coefficients in horizontal banks of both bare and finned tubes. The tests were conducted with beds of silica sand (0. 93-mm mean diameter) fluidized with air at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature in a 0. 3 m multiplied by 0. 3 m facility."People use software in service of complex tasks that are distributed over sprawling and idiosyncratically constructed technological and social networks. The aims and means of carrying out those tasks are not only complex but uncertain, which creates problems for providing help if the tasks, starting points, and endpoints cannot be assumed.

The authors propose that students do four things: (a) learn to spot and articulate research problems; (b) find their vocation-The work to which they feel a personal calling-within technical communication; (c) identify the research methods that best suit their personalities; and (d) articulate a research identity and agenda that they can explain at three different levels of abstraction: describing individual projects, naming the coherent themes that connect these projects, and defining themselves concisely as scholars. All these orienting practices involve students in stepping back, looking for larger patterns in their work and in their professional interests, and finding specific language to represent them. © The Author(s) 2017.""Employers' use of behavioral description interviews has increased dramatically within the past decade. Yet the pedagogical literature geared toward helping appli cants respond to these unique interviewing questions has not kept pace. Evidence shows that behavioral description questions require respondents to tell stories and that storytelling is now critical to applicants' success in employment interviews. We present criteria by which to judge the effectiveness of applicants' stories and demonstrate how business communication instructors might use these criteria to help applicants tell better stories. Specifically, the criteria presented in this article are : To what degree is a story internally consistent? To what degree is a story con sistent with facts the listener holds to be true? To what degree is a story relevant to the question asked and the claim being made? To what degree is a story univocal? To what degree does a story provide details that support the claim being made? How does the way a story is told reflect the teller's beliefs and values? © 2003, Sage Publications.

In this article we describe our effort to convert the paper course material to an on-line advisory system, called Ganesh Helper. Through the logging of students' actions and observations it was possible to assess some aspects of the use of Ganesh Helper (searching, browsing, and switching between writing and reading) while the students were writing part of a report. A questionnaire taught us that a majority of the students found the helpviewer easy to use and useful. But in the case of Ganesh Helper most of the students still preferred the textbook to the helpviewer.""My article traces the development, chronicles the impact, and explains the essence of Herbert Spencer's ""The Philosophy of Style"" (1852). Spencer's essay has had a significant influence on stylistics, especially in scientific and technical communication. Although in our generation Spencer's contribution to stylistics is not widely remembered, it ought to be. His single essay on this subject was seminal to modern theories about effective communication, not because it introduced new knowledge but because it was such a rhetorically astute synthesis of stylistic lore, designed to connect traditional rhetorical theory with 19th-century ideas about science, technology, and evolution. It was also influential because it was part of Spencer's grand ""synthetic philosophy,"" a prodigious body of books and essays that made him one of the most prominent thinkers of his time. Spencer's ""Philosophy of Style"" carried the day, and many following decades, with its description of the human mind as a symbol-processing machine, with its description of cognitive and affective dimensions of communication, and with its scientifically considered distillation of the fundamental components of effective style. We should read Spencer's essay and understand its impact not so much because we expect it to teach us new things about good style, but precisely because: 1) it's at the root of some very important concepts now familiar to us; 2) it synthesizes these concepts so impressively; 3) we can use it heuristically as we continue thinking about style; and 4) it provides a compact, accessible touchstone for exploring - with students, clients, and colleagues - the techniques of effective style for scientific and technical communication."Questions the contribution of heuristics to problem detection  Shows that heuristics provide more focus to expert evaluation."To offer additional tools for the assessment of effectiveness and usability in technology-mediated communication based in established heuristics. Method: An interdisciplinary group of researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute selected five disparate examples of technology-mediated communication, formally evaluated each using contemporary heuristics, and then engaged in an iterative design process to arrive at an expanded toolkit for in depth analyses. Results: A set of heuristics and operationalized metrics for the deeper analysis of a broader scope of contemporary technology-mediated communication. Conclusions: The continual evolution of communication, including the emergence of new, interactive media, provides a challenging opportunity to identify effective approaches and techniques. There are benefits to a renewed focus on relationships between people and between people and information, and we offer additional criteria and metrics to supplement established means of heuristic analysis.""The debate as to whether heuristics or prescription provides the best approach to teaching technical writing is still largely unresolved. When heuristics are used as process, as problem-solving devices, and when prescription is used as a product-producing device, a useful synthesis of two approaches occurs. This article presents such a synthesis of heuristics and prescription; it concludes with a short annotated bibliography on heuristics (12 items) and prescription (5 items) and 2 items combining heuristics and prescription which can be used by the technical writing teacher and the technical writer.""Identifies how accident reports often strip victims of their humanity and hide the tragic human consequences of technological failures Reviews a series of accident reports, focusing on their use of illustrations, and proposes techniques to humanize the reports""A recent International Civil Aviation Organization initiative mandates that pilots and air-traffic controllers operating on international routes demonstrate adequate English-language proficiency for successful communication. The Versant Aviation English Test was developed to serve this purpose. It is a fully automated speaking and listening performance test, where administration of the test tasks and scoring of the candidates' responses are computerized. We argue that not only do candidates engage in cognitively and linguistically appropriate interactions, but that computer-generated scores and human ratings are consistent (r = 0.94), enabling valid score-based decisions to be made on the basis of automated language testing. © 2006 IEEE.""This article proposes a more complex consideration of the idea-generation stage of the document design process.

Of the 424 suggestions tutors made, 106 were hints. Using Weizman' s model as a guide, the study describes three types of hints that tutors used: evaluations, general rules, and elisions. It also investigates the benefits that tutors receive from using those types of hints and examines the problems for students that can arise when tutors state their suggestions as hints. Combined with previous research Jindings, the findings of this study suggest that tutors should pair mildly negative evaluations and general rules with direct suggestions, and tutors should avoid strongly negative evaluations, i.e., criticisms. The findings also suggest that tutors can elide suggestions and provide words and phrases for students' documents but that they should only do this occasionally to model effective tone or syntax. © 2005 IEEE.""Hiring a consultant to teach in-house technical writing courses may afford heightened expertise, greater objectivity, lower costs, and more flexibility in scheduling. But it may also result in the hiring of an instructor who is not familiar with the peculiar communication needs and requirements of your organization. Careful and candid preparation of the course in conjunction with the consultant can maximize the benefits and eliminate the drawbacks.""The foundation for Rome's imperial bureaucracy was laid during the first century B.C., when functional and administrative writing played an increasingly dominant role in the Late Republic. During the First and Second Triumvirates, Roman society, once primarily oral, relied more and more on documentation to get its official business done. By the reign of Augustus, the orator had ceded power to the secretary, usually a slave trained as a scribe or librarian. This cultural and political transformation can be traced in the career of Marcus Tullius Tiro (94 B.C. to 4 A.D.), Cicero's confidant and amanuensis. A freedman credited with the invention of Latin shorthand (the notae Tironianae), Tiro transcribed and edited Cicero's speeches, composed, collected, and eventually published his voluminous correspondence, and organized and managed his archives and library. As his former master's fortune sank with the dying Republic, Tiro's began to rise. After Cicero's assassination, he became the orator's literary executor and biographer. His talents were always in demand under the new bureaucratic regime, and he prospered by producing popular grammars and secretarial manuals. He died a wealthy centenarian and a full Roman citizen. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The article discusses the conditions at the turn of the twentieth century that gave rise to the study and teaching of business English in schools.

These studies have focused on practitioners, artifacts, genres, movements, techniques, events, and the profession, as well as relevant methodology and pedagogy. There are still many opportunities for historical research in our discipline, particularly in the areas of chirographic, oral, and nonverbal communication as well as technical communication activities such as illustrating, translating, and editing and the business of technical communication. Researchers now have many online indexes, databases, and archives to assist them in locating and studying primary sources. There is a need, however, for greater coordination among scholars and a better awareness of the areas that have already been studied. Historical studies can serve teachers and practitioners by suggesting ideas, supplying precedents, creating critical distance, and establishing context. © 2007 IEEE.""After reviewing publications on the broader history of technical communication that have appeared over the past decade, this paper suggests that historical studies can easily be pursued in North America owing to the rich source material available here. The discussion identifies recent microfilm or microprint publications of both primary sources and reference guides to them. It then explores three examples of early 19th-century published engineering reports and comments on their historical implications. The paper concludes by arguing that there is a role for history in the teaching and research of technical communication. © 1991 IEEE""Of all the forms of technical and engineering writing, none perhaps is more troublesome to learn than the specification. This ancient form of technical writing is at the very center of understanding technical writing in perspective, in history, and in practice. By tracking the language and history of known specification types, an understanding of craftsmanship emerges that illuminates the uses of all technical writing as well as providing a thread and a set of connections for modern readers. This spectrum of specifications-Type I: Control of Nature, Type II: War and Military Science, and Type III: Commerce-provides practitioners and instructors alike with an enhanced understanding of this significant communication medium.""This article presents a reprint of the article ""HonestCommunication,"" published by the Royal Bank of Canada in their May 1972 newsletter.

' He focuses on computer-assisted writing instruction and suggests a framework for designing computer personalities to match user preferences. 26 refs."In this study, six focus groups comprising technical communicators and technical communication instructors evaluated and discussed two versions of an instructional manual and two versions of a memo. Findings reveal that the practitioners and academics relied on similar metaphors (including the Conduit Metaphor), metonymies, and constructed scenarios. Although their ways of evaluating texts were broadly similar, practitioners exhibited greater awareness of task-related rhetorical variables whereas academics were more likely to be concerned with textual features and general principles that apply to technical writing tasks. Differences between the groups were particularly evident in discussions of the memo. © 2005 Sage Publications.""An author’s violations of ethics can be either intentional or unintentional.

Managers set a bad example for employees with their own writing. Management practices in the review of writing delay the writer in finishing the work but do not add appreciably to its quality."Some management scholars argue that academic literature is becoming less and less relevant to practicing managers. Thomas posits that the same will be true for business communication if scholars do not venture into the field and connect with those who do business communication. As organizations shift from manufacturing to service jobs, expand their operations overseas, manage talent more strategically, and alter traditional bureaucratic structures, business communication is becoming increasingly intercultural, virtual, horizontal, strategic, and change focused. Yet it is not clear that the business communication literature is keeping pace. Examples of Thomas's work in interagency collaboration, electronic mail overload, and strategic communication demonstrate possibilities for gaining access and studying communication dilemmas that face practicing managers. Bridging the academic-practitioner gap is a way to build face validity in the business world as well as help academics to develop better theories about workplace communication. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""While the number of college courses being delivered via the Internet is increasing rapidly, our knowledge of what makes these courses effective learning experiences for students is still limited. Therefore, I conducted a study that examined the effects of technological, pedagogical, and student characteristics on student learn ing in Internet-based MBA courses. Of these characteristics, I found that only those reflecting instructor efforts to create an interactive classroom environment were significantly associated with student learning. Other characteristics such as the perceived ease of use of the course software package, the perceived flexibility of the online classroom environment, and the amount of time students spent logged onto the course Website were not significantly associated with student learning. These findings suggest that while some level of technological sophistication may be important, teaching expertise may be the primary criterion for teaching success in the online classroom environment. Therefore, instructors may need to spend more time developing and cultivating instructional skills such as simultaneously working with several smaller groups of students, developing interesting discussion questions, and fostering intimacy. To support this faculty development, business schools will likely need to make substantial infrastructural investments to ensure that their online course offerings are pedagogically and technologically conducive to student learning. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Learning to write, then, becomes a process of socialization. In order to examine how this learning through socialization occurs, interviews were conducted with co-op engineering students and their supervisors about documents the students had written. In the case studies presented, comparisons are made between the perceptions of supervisors, a student with three-months experience, and a student with twenty-one months experience. The more experienced student more closely matched the supervisor in understanding the document. The less experienced student was nonetheless able to write competently by using a model document and interacting with his supervisor.""Readability equations are widely used to compute how well readers will be able to understand written materials. Those equations were usually developed for nontechnical materials, namely, textbooks for elementary, middle, and high schools. This study examines to what extent computerized readability predictions are consistent for highly technical material - selected Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and International Standards Organization (ISO) Recommended Practices and Standards relating to driver interfaces. Literature review: A review of original sources of readability equations revealed a lack of specific criteria in counting various punctuation and text elements, leading to inconsistent readability scores. Few studies on the reliability of readability equations have identified this problem, and even fewer have systematically investigated the extent of the problem and the reasons why it occurs. Research questions: (1) Do the most commonly used equations give identical readability scores? (2) How do the scores for each readability equation vary with readability tools? (3) If there are differences between readability tools, why do they occur? (4) How does the score vary with the length of passage examined? Method: Passages of varying lengths from 12 selected SAE and ISO Recommended Practices and Standards were examined using five readability equations (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index, Coleman-Liau Index, and Automated Readability Index) implemented five ways (four online readability tools and Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows). In addition, short test passages of text were used to understand how different readability tools counted text elements, such as words and sentences. Results and conclusions: The mean readability scores of the passages from those 12 SAE and ISO Recommended Practices and Standards ranged from the 10th grade reading level to about 15th. The mean grade reading levels computed across the websites were: Flesch-Kincaid 12.8, Gunning Fog 15.1 SMOG 12.6, Coleman-Liau 13.7, and Automated Readability Index 12.3. Readability score estimates became more consistent as the length of the passage examined increased, with no noteworthy improvements beyond 900 words. Among the five readability tools, scores typically differed by two grade levels, but the scores should have been the same. These differences were due to how compound and hyphenated words, slashes, numbers, abbreviations and acronyms, and URLs were counted, as well other punctuation and text elements. These differences occurred because the sources for these equations often did not specify how to score various punctuation and text elements. Of the tools examined, the authors recommend Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows if the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is required. © 1988-2012 IEEE."Discusses the cognitive shortcuts that may hinder technical communicators in empathizing with readers. Explores the issue of judging the severity of problems detected in a document evaluation. Demonstrates how cognitive shortcuts may affect technical communicators' capability to assess the likelihood and impact of reader problems."This study concerns the relationship between agent, author, and matters of fact in the doctrine and practice of classical empiricism. More particularly, it aims to provide a tentative answer to the following questions: how were empirical facts originally considered the principal object of scientific research and communication? What were the images of human conduct and the ethical codes which accompanied the rise of the fact as the prime object of human understanding? What rhetorical sources were originally deployed for the purpose of the communication of scientific factual knowledge? The historical study of empiricism provides a critical perspective on positivism on the one hand, and social constructivism on the other. It yields important insights into the linkage between experience and intentionality and its role in establishing trust in collective processes of learning."Reports on a study of how users visually search informational home pages that contain multiple navigation menus Finds that participants selected links from navigation menus organized by audience over those organized by topic when they identified with intended users of the Web sites and that elements other than navigation menus also influenced search."The authors surveyed accounting department chairpersons in AACSB-accredited universities and the managing partners of the largest accounting firms in the country to determine their perceptions of how new accountants communicate and the perceptions of available instructional methodologies.

Immediacy behaviors represent instructors' attempts to reduce the social distance between themselves and their students. While my study found that immediacy behaviors were positive predictors of student learning and course satisfaction, such other factors as student attitudes toward course soft ware, the length of a course, and prior student and instructor experience with Web-based courses were also significant predictors. These findings suggest that both structural characteristics of MBA programs and instructor behavior merit attention for Web-based courses to successfully deliver graduate management education. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Eighty-six percent of the fifty-nine respondents indicated that they do indeed use the scores to refine their admissions decisions, but only a few schools use the test diagnostically in making such other decisions as placing students in writing development courses, waving communication requirements, or granting assistantships.""Recently graduated engineers are apt to go to work in groups led by more seasoned engineers. When a new engineer gets a reporting assignment from the group leader, she is likely to assume that the group leader is her audience. That is a comfortable assumption, since the group leader speaks her language. But, it is false to assume that the immediate audience is the real audience. The new engineer's report may have to fit, for example, in a report where the aim is not technical analysis but economic justification. Writing for an unaccustomed purpose is a little like learning how to get along in a foreign culture. New engineers take pride in their work, and the familiar technical reporting format (background, problem, method, results, conclusions) lets them explain it in detail. They may feel chagrin when somebody up the line rewrites their results section and relegates the rest to an appendix or the wastebasket. It is wrenching to discover that in the corporate culture, everything but the results is looked on as BS. That is because engineers are logical people. When young, they expect the world to be logical too. And maybe it is, but its logic is not that of the linear mathematical demonstration. Organizations, like Newtonian flywheels, have inertia; the bigger they are, the more they resist changes in speed and direction. A large organization presents the same paradox as a government request for proposals: it says it wants innovative ideas, but then spells out in excruciating detail what it expects you to do.""In recent years New Zealand has seen an increasing awareness of the need for and the benefits of providing readily understandable business and government documents. In this paper I report a psycholinguistic study testing the level of consumer comprehension of bank contracts and the effect of using plain English to rewrite them. The plain versions encouraged subjects to read the documents more carefully than they read the original versions, and the subjects understood the content and implications better when the contracts were written in plain English. The most effective means of enhancing comprehension was that which included both lexical and syntactic manipulation of text. Subjects said that they preferred the plain English versions of the contracts to the traditional versions. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""Nonemployer firms - firms with no employees - present themselves as larger, more stable firms to take on clients projects.

The article then outlines implied mentoring strategies based upon this transfer and lack of cultural knowledge. The article also analyzes the literature on discourse community theory, activity theory, service learning, and internships, each of which also imply potential mentoring practices. These comprehensive best practices are also contextualized through social cognitive, community-cultural, and motivational-attitudinal components that writing mentors should consider when mentoring writing in the workplace. © The Author(s) 2015.""This study investigates how promotional language in corporate press releases is dealt with when the release is reused in different journalistic genres. Using a new coding system, it analyzes 89 press releases and their journalistic transformations. Promotional language is shown to be a regular feature of corporate press releases, especially those presenting new products or services. The first press release corpus consisted of releases issued by companies in the airline industry, and the second corpus contained press releases of various large companies operating in the Netherlands. The press releases in the first corpus were generally used in special interest media such as magazines on air travel; these media largely preserved the promotional tone of the press releases, thus exemplifying the tendency of "" promotionalization."" The press releases in the second corpus were used in economics sections of daily papers; these news reports conformed to a more ""hard news"" register because they did not include most of the promotional elements from press release material. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication."Both science and the public can be harmed by premature or inaccurate publicity.

The author examines the public relations profession from a systems theory perspective and attempts to outline skills necessary for organizational survival in the new information age. Original data was gathered from a sample population of 41 (n = 85 for a 48% response rate) public relations professionals from the membership directory of the Public Relations Society of America. The author concluded from the data that the majority of public relations professionals currently view the Internet as a one-way communication channel. In addition, the data supported the notion that public relations professionals are limited by their lack of understanding of the two-way communication potential of the medium, the speed and power of messages traveling in cyberspace, and the current legal climate as it relates to Internet activity.""The use of emotionally laden words in the scientific literature, especially on controversial topics, tends to undermine objectivity. Readers begin to respond emotionally rather than rationally. To investigate this phenomenon on some systematic basis, the authors reviewed all the articles and letters published in two major medical journals in 1971 on the subject of commonly used pschoactive drugs. Many of these articles contained words used rhetorically rather than scientifically, which undoubtedly altered opinions or reinforced prejudices among many readers, words such as ″alarming,″ ″abuse,″ ″addiction,″ and ″epidemic.″ It is believed that such rhetoric has no place in the scientific literature. It involves value judgments and not scientific evaluation, and as such concerns social and not scientific issues. It is concluded, then, that authors must avoid language that persuades rather than explains. Moreover, editors must accept a special responsibility to prevent semantic abuses from creeping into their journals.""The study of job burnout has focused primarily on workers who hold human-service jobs, such as teachers, nurses, and social workers. Little extant research, however, has explored emotional communication and job burnout among workers from other industries. The present study used the empathic communication model of burnout to explore how interactions with distressed clients affect real estate agents' feelings of burnout and thoughts of quitting. A total of 287 real estate agents and brokers completed an online questionnaire about their empathic responses to client distress, communicative responsiveness, burnout, and thoughts of quitting. Results indicate that the empathic communication model of burnout offers adequate explanation for the relationship between empathy, communication, and burnout for real estate agents. Practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Twelve currently popular technical communication textbooks are analyzed for their treatment and discussions of the types of writing that engineers produce.

This article challenges that practice with experimental evidence showing that using a succinct sentence headline to identify the main assertion of a slide leads to statistically significant increases in audience retention of that assertion. The experimental tests occurred in a large, lecture-based geoscience course that had 200 students per section. For the study, the presenter, over five class periods, used about 100 slides with mostly phrase headlines to communicate the information to two sections of students and then used the same number of slides with succinct sentence headlines to communicate the same information to two additional sections. In the slide transformations, other changes occurred such as typographical changes and conversions of bullet lists to more visual evidence. However, for the 15 slide transformations considered in this study, the principal change was the conversion of a traditional headline to a succinct sentence headline. For example, in one transformation, the phrase headline Placer Deposits in the original slide was changed to Placer deposits arise from the erosion of lode deposits in the transformed slide. When asked to recall the main assertions of slides, the students in the sections taught with the sentence-headline slides had significantly higher recall, even though our control questions revealed that the relative effort put forth by students in the sentence-headline sections was not as high as the effort put forth by those students in the traditional-headline sections. For the 15 questions in the study, the average score for the students viewing the sentence-headline slides was 79% correct, while the average for the students viewing the traditional slides was only 69% correct. A chi-square analysis shows that this difference is statistically significant at the 0.001 significance level. On seven of the 15 questions, the students in the section with the sentence-headline slides achieved statistically significant higher scores (three at the 0.001 significance level, three at the 0.005 significance level, and one at the 0.025 significance level), while on only two questions did this same audience achieve lower test scores that were statistically significant (both at the 0.01 significance level). In this classroom situation, all four sections of students not only viewed the slides during the presentation, but also had access to the slides as notes after the presentation.""The United States Copyright Office issued interim regulations and application forms at the end of 1977 to implement the major revision of the copyright statute adopted by Congress in October 1976. Aspects of the law and the regulations especially relevant to the actual registration of an original work for copyright protection are reviewed briefly, the application form is exhibited (TX for literary works; VA for visual arts is very similar), and instructions for filling out the form are excerpted.""Professional communicators and manazers can soften the tone of bad news messages by avoiding “transitional axes,11 which are words and phrases that sever one section of the message from the next section. These words destroy any potential for goodwill between the sender and receiver of the message. The sender can avoid transitional axes in at least three ways: 1) by using verbally keyed transitions such as repeated words, synonyms, specific naming, abbreviations or generic nouns; 2) by using cognitively keyed transitions that employ word- and thought-association to create implied connections; 3) by using traditional connectors such as conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs. Each of these techniques avoids use of the transitional ax and facilitates the exchange of bad news. © 1991 IEEE""The article presents tips for becoming a good business speech writer, from advice on writing to recommendations on a fee to charge for the service.

This article asserts that print warnings should adhere to the conventions of label warnings and illustrates ways to increase the effectiveness of print warnings. Standardization could benefit mass media print warnings just as it has improved industrial safety warnings. This article suggests standards for mass media print warnings, which are sometimes hard to identify as warning communications. If the standards for industrial hazard label warnings are more broadly applied to mass media print warnings, both consumers and manufacturers will benefit.""When reviewing someone else's document, the reviewer is supposed to help the writer achieve the major objective of the paper, i. e. , to communicate effectively with the reader. This paper provides guidelines that enable a reviewer to make a positive contribution by raising questions that lead the author. Most of the paper is concerned with measuring readability and style with minor emphasis on grammar.""All of the elements of quality contribute separately to the overall merit of an engineering manuscript. Inadequate content cannot masquerade under the cloak of fine writing. Nor can outmoded engineering concepts hide behind a facade of logical structure and orderly presentation of ideas. Literary style must be combined with effective organization, and results need to be fortified with the kind of balanced interpretation that identifies a manuscript of quality.""Every year, a great many foreign experts come to China to present their research achievements and products. Needless to say, all of them hope that their presentations will be successful, but the truth is that some of them fail, because they do not take into account the participants' background and language capability.

The steps are (1) writing input on uniform slips of paper, (2) sorting and classifying, and (3) consolidating the output report. Group size can reach 50 or more, the input is anonymous, and hundreds of single-phrase or single-sentence ideas, methods, answers, etc. can be obtained across a variety of disciplines involved in a problem or need. Skill in leadership, target selection, and slip processing is important. For the U. S. Tactical Air Command (TAC), a 100-page manual was written, covering 172 contractng tasks, in three mornings by using this method. The author spent two follow-up mornings with the editor who saw it through publication. Now the manual is being used by TAC and three other major Air Force commands.

Nine formats are described: narrative, step-by-step list, list with a visual aid, playscript, list of questions, flowchart, narrative flowchart, decision logic table, and decision tree. Second, the procedure must not assume knowledge the user does not have (no step left out). Third, the precedure must be fair to the user (not biased and with an equitable workload distribution).""Q & A sessions are becoming common in this era of sales meetings, stockholders meetings, and trade, civic, and social conferences and conventions.

A positive approach in three stages can increase your chance for success. Preparation: 1. Plan to have an effect; don't just be speech-giving-oriented. 2. Determine the audience's interests, motives, knowledge, attitudes, and values. 3. Be aware of your credibility with the audience. 4. Capture attention with a confident, motivating introduction. 5. Organize your information for understanding. 6. Plant the conclusion to again place your objective before the audience. Presentation: 7. Control stage fright and channel the energy into dynamic speaking. 8. Be physically active and purposeful with gestures; vary speech characteristics; be natural and direct. 9. Sense audience feedback and adjust to it. Preservation: 10. Prepare for questions from the audience.""Writing clearly and persuasively is perceived as a factor in business and social success. But writing well-structured English is not equivalent to communicating; nor is command of a large vocabulary. The key writing talent is constructing paragraphs and organizing them into a rational and persuasive whole. To this end, the following advice is given: thinking through what you want to say and to whom you want to say it can make the writing task easier. Make an outline first; then the parts can be written in any order. To structure a paragraph: Make a point, give a reason, give an example, repeat the point. An insert tells how to calculate the ″fog index″ of your writing, i. e. , the reading grade-level needed to understand it."There seldom is a practice session if one is asked to comment ″live″ on TV.

Although the quality of the report depends on the inspector, the use of standardized forms often limits the value of an inspection by restricting the amount and type of information in the report. Twenty criteria are presented as guidelines for inspection report preparation.""The quality of technical documents often depends on the way in which spatial information is expressed. The coherent processing of installation procedures, route directions, maintenance instructions, and many other technical documents often implies the construction of an almost literal mental space within which instructions have to be executed. Visuals are certainly a powerful tool in expressing instructive space, but text remains indispensable and even dominant. This article focuses on verbal spatial expressions in instructions in which text and visuals are combined. The first part provides the reader with an overview of the problems associated with putting the instructive space into language. In the second part, we report the setup and results of an experiment in which the preference for two basic types of spatial expressions is investigated: user-oriented descriptions (e.g., Pull the handle to the right) versus functional descriptions (e.g., Push the start switch toward the tone button). The results show an overall preference for producing functional descriptions, but also a higher degree of acceptability for user-oriented descriptions if the user-oriented perspective is explicitly expressed in text.""An intensive reading of a research report is a three-step process. The first is an analytic reading, in which the aim is to separate the paper into parts that can be understood. The second is an interpretive reading, in which understanding is derived by building the author's sentences into propositions and arguments. The third reading is critical, in which strengths and weaknesses of the paper are identified. Thinking, more than word-for-word perusal, marks the second and third readings.""The article refers to the Committee Report of the 1983 Teaching Methodology and Concepts Committee, research by John A.

Rather than relying on intuition or personal preference, technical communicators can use a research-driven approach to analyze objectively the extent to which a typeface's personality meshes with the intended tone of a document. This study describes how technical communicators can analyze a typeface's uppercase J and its lowercase a, g, e, and n letterforms - letterforms that are dense with anatomical information -to gauge the extent to which a typeface will contribute a friendly or a professional personality to a document. Technical communicators - both professionals and students - who are armed with this knowledge can move beyond ""safe"" typefaces like Times New Roman and Helvetica, selecting instead typefaces whose anatomical features generate different kinds of personalities. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Graduate interns in technical writing and editing can be a valuable source of professional support for a publications department, especially if their managers keep certain management principles in mind.

Key concepts: Search engines' rankings are shaped by three classes of participants: search engine companies and programmers, search engine optimization practitioners, and search engine users. Key lessons: By applying three key lessons, professional communicators can make it easier for audiences to find their web content through search engines: (1) consider their web content's audiences and website's competitors when analyzing keywords; (2) insert keywords into web text that will appear on search engine results pages, and (3) involve their web content and websites with other web content creators. Implications: Because successful search engine optimization requires considerable time, professional communicators should progressively apply these lessons in the sequence presented in this tutorial and should keep up to date with frequently changing ranking algorithms and with the associated changing practices of search optimization professionals. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article gives practical advice on technical book writing based on the author's experience. Early collection and thorough analysis of resource and bibliographic materials often yield extra useful information. Making the first sentences or paragraphs or pages of each unit comprehensible even to one's ″grandmother″ is a good first step toward making the entire text comprehensible to its intended audience. Publishing survey or review articles, speaking at conferences, and developing annotated bibliographies are ways of rehearsing chapter writing and having something to show at each stage of the work."Writing an effective recommendation requires an understanding of the reader and his specific needs. A 'recommendation outline' is presented here which will meet those needs and also ease the burden of preparing the recommendation itself."The four reasons for writing for publication are to advance professionally, to gain prestige, to obtain financial payment, and to receive psychological compensation. Editors reject manuscripts because they have printed similar articles, because the content of the rejected article has recently been published, or because the content of the article will not hold the reader's interest. To write a publishable article, the writer must consider: the timeliness of the subject, his interest in the manuscript, the wide interest of the readers, the objectivity, the usefulness, and the relevancy of the subject.

Its central theme is that reports contain many unnecessary words which force the reader to separate the important from the unimportant words until he becomes bored. The unnecessary words result from using indirect expressions, circumlocutions, the passive voice, and redundancy. This article gives examples of these unnecessary word generators and suggests how to remove them. It also gives other guidelines to improve writing.""Information and communication technology for development (ICTD) involves using information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve the well-being of people in resource-constrained environments. Because ICTD projects involve crafting technical information and the ICTs that convey it, ICTD involves challenges familiar to technical communicators, such as balancing stakeholder interests and building credibility necessary to influence stakeholders. This article presents how trust and credibility affect ICTD projects, describing implications for development contexts and for distributed work environments. © Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""The Undergraduate Studies Committee of the American Business Communi cation Association for 1972 studied the problem of how undergraduate busi ness communication programs can meet the communication needs of business.

Catalogical writing tends to handle details serially without implying which ones are more important than others. Analytical writing, however, clearly distinguishes among the details. To be aware of the difference is an important step in creating an informative written report. Engineers can apply four tests to their writing to measure how well they are informing. They can (1) count the prepositional phrases and rewrite them into dependent clauses; (2) see how frequently their sentences are cast in subject-verb-object order and rewrite them for variety; (3) identify and replace abstract nouns with concrete nouns; and (4) recognize passive verbs and replace them with more active and more informative ones.""The author discusses that writing, when taken seriously, can interact with and stimulate the writer's thought process. Tools such as the microcomputer are shown to help through reducing the tedious jobs, especially by allowing easier access to and revision of work. Writing by increments is also facilitated. An example of the interaction between writing and creative processes is given.""To help students enter a professional discourse community, teachers must assess how accurately they both understand the community's discourse practices. Our research investigated how job recruiters seeking to fill positions in mechanical engineering or marketing were influenced by the quality of writing in student résumés. The résumés varied in elaboration, sentence style, mechanics, and amount of relevant work experience. The recruiters rated the résumés to indicate their willingness to interview the students. We found that recruiters in the two fields—engineering and marketing—valued quite different writing features. When we subsequently asked students in business writing and technical writing classes to rate the same résumés, we found that they underestimated the importance of various writing features. Generally, however, students ratings resembled those of the recruiters in their respective disciplines. This study documents how students can improve their résumés and provides insight into the variations of discourse practices in professional disciplines. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

The correlational study reported here demonstrates that these same relationships can be observed in the reading of hypertext. In addition, correlations among spatial processing abilities and performance with hypertext support the idea that spatial and relational processing play important roles in reading and using hypertext.""Business communication faculty often assign projects that require students to interview, survey, or observe human subjects. Depending on the nature of the project and the policies at the faculty member's university, such projects may require prior approval by the university's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Therefore, business communication faculty will benefit from an understanding of three areas related to IRB review of class projects involving human subjects research: (1) whether their institution requires such class projects to be reviewed by the university's IRB and, if so, what form the review takes; (2) how they can adapt classroom activities, materials, and assignments so that human subjects research by students complies with IRB policies; and (3) how they can relate IRB policies to issues that students may face in their future professional lives. © 2003, Sage Publications.

We begin with a discussion of how HCD emerged in scholarly work at the edges of our field in places such as design, psychology, art, and engineering. Following this, we consider how an HCD perspective is manifesting itself in academic programs in different institutional contexts. We then discuss how this trend is further illustrated by the transformation of our department at the University of Washington, which shifted from being the Department of Technical Communication to becoming the Department of Human Centered Design and Engineering. Finally, we discuss the work of a group of researchers who contributed articles to this special issue. Each of these articles offers a perspective from someone within our field about how an HCD perspective has influenced their thinking and research. © The Author(s) 2016.""Human-centered design philosophy proposes that end users be at the center of technical system designs. Building on a seminal study by Gould and Lewis, we present findings from two surveys that explored the practice of building interactive systems from the perspective of information and communication technology (ICT) professionals. We generated ICT job descriptions based on a lexicon derived from practitioners' own words. We found that while ""human-centeredness"" has risen among ICT professionals, our respondents varied significantly in how they considered the original three Gould and Lewis principles with respect to their job titles and roles. We thus argue that tools that support clear communication among roles are critical; in this project, we analyzed personas as a common ICT communication tool.While personas were generally perceived positively, persona creators need to consider factors that contribute to buy-in from design teams, including quality research and effective presentation. © The Author(s) 2016.""Large institutions, like hospitals and juvenile mental health facilities, are often places where members from several different professions come to interact and negotiate ideological differences. This study explores the authorial identities of some of these members in the electronic charts of a large juvenile mental health facility. These charts portray their authors' ethos as that which is fluid and variable, craftily moving between the neutral observer status of scientific rhetoric and the expert blame-shifter of social work rhetoric.

In this view, knowledge, reality, and even facts are community generated, “linguistic entities,” and hypertext supports the “social interface” rather than the “deep structure” of thought. This essay Considers some of the premises of Barrett's proposal. A central issue is the rejection of the “authorial imperative” of structured information in favor of a view of writing as an Open-ended ever-changing conversation in which readers and writers collaborate to discover—or generate—reality. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

It begins with a look back at some of the important concepts and theorists writing about hypertext theory from the post-World War II era, to the early years of the World Wide Web 2.0, and the very differing notions of its potential. A significant challenge during this formative period was the fact that limitations in technology and infrastructure placed limitations on the potential envisioned by these scholars. The ways in which we look at early scholarship differ even a decade or more later, in terms of some of the information technologies and tools we use today. In the Web 2.0 era, we see a trend of blending and extension beyond principles found within hypertext theory in the tools we use and user experiences we create with them. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Hypertext, an electronic communication medium in which information is structured and accessed according to the audience’s needs and interests, is increasingly used in business and technical communication. That use may justify curricula expansion in the development of the ability to communicate in hypertext from specialty courses to a variety of business and technical courses, including the foundation course. This article provides a concise overview of hypertext for instructors who may be considering this expansion but who need to become more familiar with the medium. The basic information that is provided includes the definition, uses, and advantages of hypertext. In addition, the terminology, theoretical bases, and essential structure of hypertext are discussed. Of particular concern to business and technical communication instructors who may be considering adding hypertext to their courses are the problems that the medium presents. Discussion includes considerations of linguistic design, computer capabilities, and human performance. Finally, behaviors that business and technical communicators should exhibit to encourage the use of hypertext are presented. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The unit presented introduces students to a heuristic of research and shows students how to apply research techniques. The sequence elucidates the steps and loops through which a researcher passes in moving from initial topic to completed thesis. The article argues that neither research nor written report can work without a (hypo)thesis. Arguing against the currently taught inductionist models of research, it adopts Karl Popper's model of research by conjecture and refutation. The process of conjecture and refutation is just as valid for library-based research as it is for original scientific research. The pedagogical sequence, then, shows students how to develop conjectures and how to use literature to refute or modify them in the development of a final thesis for the research report.""An effective résumé means one that includes two addresses and two phone numbers.

One should not (1) ape pedantic speakers or those who indulge in gobbledygook, (2) be ambiguous, (3) use redundancies, (4) mispronounce words, (5) confuse word meanings, or (6) ignore changes in the English language. To choose exactly the right words to express thoughts, a speaker needs a large vocabulary. The only way to acquire such a vocabulary is to read widely, listen carefully, and practice assiduously each new word one encounters. 5 refs.""Although research has explored employees’ organizational identification, few scholars have investigated liminal workers’ identification. This gap is problematic because nonmembers represent organizations and their attachments may influence their work. To understand this poorly understood phenomenon, we conducted interviews with agency social media writers who were not employed by organizations they represented online. Contrary to practitioners avowing that only internal employees can communicate via social media, we found agency writers adopt multiple identification lenses, which lead to different work practices. These results contribute to organizational, stakeholder, and consumer-company identification research and help social media writers better communicate on behalf of organizations. © 2016 by the Association for Business Communication Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.""Young men have strong desires, and whatever they desire they are prone to do….

The authors use an exordial model that they derived from classical manuals on rhetoric. This model enumerates and groups rhetorical exordial techniques into 3 main functions: attentum, benevolum, and docilem. The study shows that rhetorically complete introductions are rare. Most of the speakers seemed to prefer a content-oriented, direct approach (docilem) in their introductions and seldom used techniques to garner the audience's attention (attentum) or sympathy (benevolum). The article concludes with an evaluation of the exordial model and a discussion of the study's pedagogical implications. © 2008 Sage Publications.""This article presents the results of a study that investigated readers' perceptions of tone formality in online text passages. The study found that readers perceived text passages to be less formal when they contained personal pronouns, active voice verbs, informal punctuation, or verb contractions. The study reveals that professional communicators can impact their readers' perceptions of tone in online passages. This study provides useful guidance for writers who wish to understand the impact of their stylistic decisions on audience perceptions of passage formality.""The author proposes a new writing and teaching tool - a comprehensibility measure called the i/e ratio. To use it, count the intentional (abstract) words in a writing sample, then count the extensional (concrete) words. Divide the total number of intentional words by the total number of extensional words. The result is the i/e ratio for that sample. Because it is drawn from S. I. Hayakawa's studies of semantics, it sheds light on both the readability and the comprehensibility of a writing sample. Writing samples with i/e ratios greater than 1. 0 are judged hard to understand. Rules for classifying and counting intensional and extensional words are given in this article."The company journal the author describes is intended to share new and unpublished R and D work with the scientific and engineering communities and to encourage the free exchange of technical information among workers in the field. He discusses methods of promoting this important two-way flow of its information and gives some insight as to how the authors also derive subtle benefits."If one's ideas register clearly with listeners, the primary goal of speaking has been realized. Guided by selected principles of learning, a speaker can plan the content of the message so that listeners can more completely understand the intended meaning. In this discussion, the providing of idea clarification is correlated with the promoting of learning for listeners. Ten principles of learning are characterized. Random effort by the speaker can be replaced by purposeful, advance design in the speaker's presentation in order to establish clarity for ideas.""This study explores whether companies embracing a corporate social responsibility agenda have a strategic focus on adapting and aligning their value systems to reflect such commitment. The analysis is based on empirical data and a conceptual model juxtaposing corporate values, corporate social responsibility values, and implementation to capture how the different configurations of these aspects may impact the communication carried out by corporations. The findings indicate that the companies in the data sample operate with two markedly different value systems. The coexistence of two value systems is discussed in relation to the reported difficulties that companies experience when facing the new and complex challenge of communicating corporate social responsibility. © The Author(s) 2014.""Improving communication between tax practitioners and IRS agents requires identification of specific barriers that impede effective communication. This study extends prior research on communication barriers to the tax practitioner-IRS agent relationship. Survey responses of 98 experienced national and international tax practitioners revealed that the barriers perceived to be the most serious relate to behavioral and personality concerns, personal conditions, inflexible thinking, physical concerns, technical competence, and closed-minded attitudes. Although these perceptions generally were invariant to gender and age, some differences were observed by the level of work experience of the respondents. The results of this study may be used by the IRS to develop outreach and education programs consistent with Compliance 2000, a philosophy of tax administration that aims to improve communication channels between the practitioner community and IRS agents. In addition, practitioners may use the results to devise ways to deal with communication problems during interactions with the IRS. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Since self-reflection is one of the characteristics of academic maturity, we chose to examine the intellectual foundations of the field for clues to its future directions. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""It is argued that, with today's growing emphasis on audience analysis in technical communication, there needs to be a sharper focus on the informational needs of various audiences; much empirical study is needed to provide a fuller definition and understanding of the nature of these informational needs and how they directly affect the writing done. Effective upward management communication is directly dependent on the quality of communication moving downward in the organization to the staff, and on how the staff is made to understand the decision-making role and informational needs of the management reader. Of all the people involved in technical communications, the manager of the writers may be best equipped to determine the informational needs of readers, especially those of upper management. A brief review of two empirical studies conducted by the author demonstrates the value of such studies and encourages others to undertake similar studies.""Despite the increasing interests raised by incident reporting systems, it is still unclear what dimensions of user experience (UX) and other contextual factors should be taken into account for the various stages of declaring an incident using mobile-phone applications. Research questions: How do citizens perceive and describe urban incidents? What UX dimensions are important for reporting an incident with a mobile-phone application? What other (contextual) factors are important from the users' point of view when declaring incidents? Which of the UX dimensions and contextual factors are important when in the various phases during an incident declaration? Literature review: Overall, there is a lack of empirical research in the domain of incident reporting. In general, the UX dimensions - visual and aesthetic experience, emotion, stimulation, identification, meaning and value, and social relatedness/coexperience - are important when designing interactive systems. It also shows that incidents are related to the citizen's perception of the environment. Methodology: A triangulated method approach combining interviews, a survey of existing systems, and a model-based task analysis were applied. This allows us to present a generic task model for incident reporting with a detailed description of UX dimensions affected in the various subtasks. Results and conclusions: Our findings point out the effect of UX dimensions in the task engaged by users when reporting urban citizens. The overall UX is directly influenced by the perceived level of severity, inconvenience and involvement, the personal context, and the technological mobile context. We have found that while several UX dimensions are highly relevant, they are not equally distributed along the several subtasks that citizens engage when reporting incidents. This study shows that semistructured requirement interviews can provide information about UX dimensions and it highlights the importance of the identification of UX dimensions in early phases of the development process. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has adopted copyright policies and procedures to conform with the requirements of the new U.

Unfortunately, a similar amount of effort has not been expended on determining the economic value of that information to the user. For over a year now, the IEEE has been conducting an experiment aimed both at testing a selective dissemination system and, from the subscriber behavior, determining the price elasticity of material presented via that system. Initial data indicate that early adopters of such a system behave in a fashion analogous to that observed in early adopters of other technological innovations. Based on these early data, the program is being extended in order to determine price elasticity in an equilibrated system.""The year 1984 was the centennial year for the AIEE, which merged with the IRE in 1963 to form the IEEE. During those same hundred years, electrical science and engineering made dramatic advances.

It is used to present a large quantity of complex information in a simple, straightforward manner. Since the decision table requires no special symbols or shapes, it is understood by nonprogrammers and programmers alike. It can thus serve as a common denominator for a project team, a quick-reference card, and a step-by-step procedural guide. The author argues that if time is invested in explaining how to use a decision table then both the writer and the user will profit from a valuable documentation tool.""This study investigates the phenomenon of user-generated content strategy in an open-source, wiki-based content-management system (CMS) for the repair of technological devices (http://ifixit.com). By ""user-generated content strategy,"" we mean processes for developing systems for producing, moderating, and encouraging user-generated content. Research questions: (1) What strategies, or holistic means of organizing content, are used to manage repair manual content via an open-source, wiki-based content-management system that relies on content generated by a wide variety of users? (2) What content rules, or logical premises for how and where content is developed, emerge from a qualitative case study of such a CMS? Literature review: Though a wealth of empirical research has been conducted into user-generated content, few studies have focused on the explicit strategies employed by organizations to develop and encourage such content. At the same time, several recent calls by researchers in both academia and industry have indicated a need for such content models. Some of the challenges these thinkers have noted with creating user-generated content strategies include the difficulty of maintaining a consistent strategy across content generated by users who don't necessarily understand what strategies are in place, as well as maintaining a modicum of quality assurance without squelching user participation. Methodology: We conducted a content audit of iFixit's main educational initiative, the Technical Writing Project (http://edu.ifixit.com) to identify strategies iFixit uses to organize content in this initiative. iFixit is an open-source wiki to help users repair their own devices. We supplemented the audit with interviews with student participants in the project and iFixit technical writing staff to find out what technologies and other affordances affected users of the iFixit Technical Writing Project. Results and conclusions: The main user-generated content strategies used by iFixit include allowing users a wide range of means to participate (such as posting comments or developing their own repair guides), using a content moderation queue (or simple interface for seeing all updates to the wiki), ensuring quality assurance of all repair guide content through redundancy (such as making sure experienced users vetted every published guide), and staging (or arranging information in a linear sequence) information in a multimodal fashion (using multiple modes of communication to reinforce the same information). Such strategies represent a commitment by iFixit to opening up practices that are central to creating content, such as repair documentation, to any interested internet user. Lessons for organizations who wish to encourage user-generated content include developing strategies that protect users from the worst consequences of their actions, that encourage participation, and that allow for experienced users to vet new content. © 2016 IEEE.""Formats to teach procedures were developed to incorporate appropriate learning strategies. The formats contain a preponderance of graphics with supporting text and include a foldout, or paper mock-up, showing the face of the equipment. Exercises are provided for recalling individual steps and for chaining steps. These materials, called learning aids, were developed and field-tested on two pieces of complex equipment: tuning an oscilloscope probe and starting a helicopter engine. Results showed the learning aids reduce errors and produce quicker learning compared with narrative manuals commonly used to teach procedures.""This article examines illustrations in two medical texts written in China's Northern Song dynasty. Compared with medical books produced in previous dynasties, these two texts incorporated more illustrations with enhanced beauty and usability. These visual features, I argue, carried rhetorical attributes that helped these texts negotiate their way into printing, circulation, and becoming canonical in their own genres. At the same time, they also facilitated efficient and accurate reading through reduced visual clutter and enhanced accuracy, and thus appealed to both the elite and the public readership. The article reviews these visual strategies and their implication for technical communication today. © The Author(s) 2016.""Many technical documents present information both graphically and verbally.

Yet recent exit interviews of Clarkson University graduates majoring in Technical Communications revealed that students have a clear hierarchy of worth that places technology at the top because of its supposed objectivity. Further, students opposed technology to creativity, which they took to be the domain of writing. This paper asks several pointed questions aimed at probing how technical communication curricula can show students that creativity and reason may be in harmony, and help them better understand their own talents and skills. © 1988 IEEE""Technical books written for women in the English Renaissance provide a rich source for furthering knowledge of the literacy of women, particularly middle class women—the audience for these books—and the roles these women assumed. These technical books for women show that Renaissance women assumed active roles, were generally as literate as men, and needed books to help them execute major responsibilities in home medical care, home and estate management, animal husbandry, cooking, and gardening. These books also show that women's literacy increased rapidly by the end of the Renaissance and that the increase in the demand for books was most certainly due in part to demands by women for technical and other forms of how-to books. The effectiveness with which Renaissance technical writers adapted content and style for women readers should remind the modern technical writer of the value of gender considerations in designing content and style. © 1992 IEEE""A common challenge facing those who prepare graduate students to teach writing online is the need to help those students connect online writing instruction (OWI) theory with their classroom practice.

To make this argument, the article presents data from a case study of a technical communicator at a software firm, showing how a reminder note he carried to a meeting helped him achieve an important design change. The article unpacks the concept of immutable mobiles from actor network theory to derive a framework that helps us interpret the multiple functions of this note in helping the technical communicator warrant and win a design argument with software developers. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Because of the globalized use of the Internet, companies of most countries rely heavily on websites for the sale of their products and services internationally. However, a company's website, no matter how nicely designed in terms of graphics used and information provided, may still fail to achieve the expected result if it fails to consider the relevant business cultural values and conventions of the target country. This article, in light of American business values and Chinese business values and through case analyses, identifies the possible problems on those websites aiming at international business. Using specific company websites of both the United States and China and through comparison and contrast, the author analyzes problems in aspects of content, graphics, and layout in attempt to improve designers' cultural awareness in these aspects and improve their skills for the localization of their international business websites. ©Author(s) 2015.""This study examined the relationship between computer-user interface (character based or graphical) and the quality of written documents. Students were randomly assigned to one of two business communication labs, Macintosh or IBM. Both groups received identical lectures on business communication principles and practices. T-test analyses of two documents produced during the course compared the groups on four document criteria: content, structure, mechanics, and format. After six weeks of business communication instruction, including three 50-minute class periods of instruction on their respective computers and software, IBM users excelled on the criteria of mechanics (as hypothesized) and format (contrary to the hypothesis). After an additional five weeks of business communication instruction and use of their respective computer systems, the two groups demonstrated no significant differences on any of the criteria. The findings challenge Halio's claims for the superiority of character-based interface. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Research questions: (1) Which journals are better at selecting articles with high scientific impact (measured by average citations per article), and publishing authors with strong reputations (measured by h-indices)? (2) Does the impact of journal articles correlate positively with the reputations of their authors? and (3) Can bibliometric indicators provide a simple way for journal editors to monitor journal performance in a manner complementary to traditional ISI impact factor (IF)? Literature review: This paper reviews literature on citation analysis, a bibliometric method of measuring impact based on the number of times a work is cited, and explains such bibliometric indicators as CPP, Hirsch index, and IF which measure the impact of a journal, and introduces a new indicator called h -spectrum to objectively measure the reputation of a journal's author group. Methodology: This quantitative study performed citation analysis on 250,000 authors in 110 IEEE journals using citation statistics from the Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to construct the h -spectrum indicator. The authors used automated filtering techniques to exclude questionable author data. Results and conclusions: The first phase of analysis indicated significant differences among IEEE publications in journal impact, and found that the h-index and CPP were suitable for evaluating journals except in their most recent five years where annual rankings are proposed instead. The second phase of analysis found that h-spectra distributions of author reputation differ among journals in a single year, and are generally stable for a single journal over five years. Maps were constructed to locate journals graphically based on the complementary indicators of impact and reputation, and to show changes in impact and reputation over time. The maps indicated that journals with high impact tend to have authors with high reputations but the opposite is not necessarily true. Suggestions were made to explain different combinations of high and low impact and reputation for journals. The use of maps complements IF and provides a simple tool to monitor journal reputation at the time of most recent publication. The study is limited by assumptions about the value of citations, the reliability of search engine statistics, and the homogeneity of IEEE journal citation practices, as well as the failure to account for coauthors, article age, and authors who publish multiple times per year in the same journal. Future research could examine non-IEEE journals and normalize subfields within IEEE journals to avoid favoring fields that use more citations. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""The increasing availability of microfilm editions of journals in libraries throughout the world provides publishers with opportunities to reasses the traditional role of the journal in filling a wide spectrum of user needs. Publishers can now select media options which more precisely fit the needs of users and which result in significant cost reduction as well as producing additional revenues. For the American Chemical Society (ACS), the revenues produced are developed from the sale of the microfilm version of its back and current volumes and from a photocopying license fee included in the pricing structure. With microfilm versions of journals becoming more widely available, editors and authors are encouraged to put material into the microfilm edition that might otherwise have been carried in the printed version. Every such transfer of a page is a saving of 60 to 100 per page less any page-charge revenue. It is possible to more sharply reduce the printed pages in a journal by moving toward the digest or short-paper concept. The savings in production costs could affect the whole pattern of pricing and lead to the elimination of page charges and to lower prices for individual users of the short-form or digest journal."Many classes of disadvantaged readers fail to correctly comprehend agentless passive voice sentences. Students in a physics class at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf were given the Test of Syntactic Abilities to ascertain whether they could comprehend the passive voice structures commonly found in technical texts and reports.

The study reported on in this article provides a wider test of crisis history to better assess its role in crisis communication. Results from the present investigation showed that a history of similar crises intensified the reputational threat of a current crisis even when the crisis arose from the victimization of the organization or from an accident, rather than from the organization's intentional acts. The threat to reputation was primarily direct, rather than indirect, through perceived responsibility for the crisis. There was little difference in the perceptions of organizations identified as having had no history of past similar crises versus those for whom no information about past crises was provided. Perception of an organization's responsibility was negatively correlated with the perceived impact on reputation. Implications for the practice of crisis communication and further development of SCCT are discussed. © 2004 by the Association for Business Communication.""Future technology, not too difficult to conceive, could radically change the existing roles of author, editor, publisher, and user of original scientific material. These roles are projected beyond electronic photocomposition and significant effects are visualized in the areas of information handling and quality control. However, economics may determine that scientific publishing will be an auxiliary use of technology installed for functions more measurable than the value of information.""The disciplines of software engineering and technical writing have much in common. Both espouse a structured approach to product development, whether the product is a computer program or a manual describing that program. These disciplinary parallels suggest that technical communicators have more to offer software engineers than their usual writing and editing services. Specifically, this article describes four special services that technical communicators could provide during the first phase of software development, requirements. These services are audience analysis, functional analysis, human factors research, and requirements writing. The goals of these services are to improve the quality of software products and to make the documentation task more efficient.""Word processing is being adopted by an increasing number of companies and government agencies because it offers a method for coping with the increasing costs of administrative services.

Practicing managers’ desire to have this question answered has been the stimulus for much of the diversity-related research currently in print. However, the narrow focus on providing an answer to this particular question appears to have diverted researchers’ attention away from a number of perhaps more fundamental issues. A major issue that has been neglected in previous research studies is the impact that greater increases in work-force diversity might have on communication processes within organizations—specifically, communication processes that are associated with organizational productivity. As a contribution toward helping to fill in this research gap, this article proposes a typology of impacts that greater increases in work-force diversity might have on communication effectiveness in organizations. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Based on our research in nine stores of a major United Kingdom electronics retail chain, no one is listening to staff briefings. These managers recognised the powerful motivational and communication potential of face-to-face oral briefings. But our research showed that the potential impact was dissipated Managers were not trained to give briefings or appraised on their briefings skills. Perhaps in consequence, they prepared themselves indifferently for daily sessions and made little use of techniques known to affect attentiveness and recall In consequence, the daily communication session appeared to have little impact on motivation or behavior. This lack would indicate a major opportunity for communication professionals to help managers communicate more effectively. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""Medical personnel in hospital intensive care units routinely rely on protocols to deliver some types of patient care. These protocol documents are developed by hospital physicians and staff to ensure that standards of care are followed. Thus, the protocol document becomes a de facto standing order, standing in for the physician's judgment in routine situations. This article reports findings from Phase I of an ongoing study exploring how insulin protocols are designed and used in intensive care units to transfer medical research findings into patient care ""best practices."" We developed a taxonomy of document design elements and analyzed 29 insulin protocols to determine their use of these elements. We found that 93% of the protocols used tables to communicate procedures for measuring glucose levels and administering insulin. We further found that the protocols did not adhere well to principles for designing instructions and hypothesized that this finding reflected different purposes for instructions (training) and protocols (standardizing practice).""The narrative concepts of the implied author and implied reader elucidate how business texts represent writers and readers. It is important, though, to distinguish carefully between writers’ implications and readers’ inferences. Instructors should contrast implied versus inferred writers and readers, provide multiple ways to comprehend these concepts, and illustrate them with examples (e.g., those provided in this article from Citigroup, Andersen, and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia). The meaning-as-event analytical method, from reader-response narrative theory, reveals specific language features through which business texts manifest readers and writers. To help writers plan and readers analyze such texts, instructors may use the teaching suggestions, sample assignments, prewriting heuristics, and evaluation criteria provided in this article. © 2004, Sage Publications.

Can Desnoyers' taxonomy facilitate better interdisciplinary communication in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields by helping practitioners choose more efficient data visuals? In addition, would adopting Desnoyers' taxonomy bypass the current discrepancies between academic and journal data visuals? Methods: To test Desnoyers' taxonomy's impact on efficient use of data visuals, I did an exploratory, pretest/posttest survey of 101 STEM students and their choices of data visuals before and after exposure to Desnoyers' taxonomy. Results: Students chose more complex and more efficient data visuals on the posttest, after exposure to Desnoyers' taxonomy. However, level in school did not change the effect of exposure. Conclusion: Students' reported use of data visuals supports prior research about discrepancies between academic and journal data visuals. Additionally, students might benefit from having more exposure and training in efficient data visuals. Further control group studies are needed to show if Desnoyers' taxonomy itself can increase students' comprehension and use of efficient data visuals as compared to pure explanation of data visuals. If the further studies demonstrate that, then researchers and creators in the field of data visualization could confidently adopt Desnoyers' taxonomy as a way to teach and reference data visuals consistently. © 2015, (publisher).All rights reserved.""This study investigates Total Quality Control (TQC), stressing the central role of com munication processes.

The first is the vesting of copyright in the name of the author at the creation of the manuscript or article. The second is the differentiation between the copyright of the collective work of articles and the copyright of the individual article. This report summarizes the implications and impact of these two provisions and others on the policies and procedures of the American Institute of Physics. The key change in procedure after the new copyright law takes effect will be the requirement of authors to transfer their copyright to the publisher at the time of submission of the manuscript. The transfer will be limited by certain rights that will be reserved for the authors in the use of their own articles. This procedure was adopted on April 1, 1977 by the Governing Board of the American Institute of Physics for AIP owned journals. The report also summarizes an important remaining question for primary journal publishers which is the exercise of rights under copyright for abstracts and other items excerpted from journal articles.""This study investigates the link between the linguistic principles of implicature and pragmatics and software documentation. When implicatures are created in conversation or text, the listener or reader is required to fill in missing information not overtly stated. This information is usually filled in on the basis of previous knowledge or context. Pragmatics, the study of language use in context, is concerned with the situational aspects of language use that, among other things, directly affect implicatures required of the reader. I investigate how two manuals for the same software product can be analyzed on the basis of implicature and pragmatics. One is an original copy of the documentation that came with the product, the other an after-market manual. Results show that the aftermarket manual requires far fewer implicatures of the reader and does a better job of providing pragmatically helpful information for the user.""By conducting individual conferences with students of technical writing, instructors may deal with important information which may not surface in a traditional classroom setting. For students, conferences 'break the ice' by letting them know that the instructor is eminently approachable and is available for future discussions.

Study One used imprecise frequency descriptors to describe level of side effect occurrence and then asked consumers to numerically estimate the frequency of side effect occurrence. A comparison of consumers' estimated to actual level of incidence indicated that they are unable to accurately estimate level of side effect occurrence when those levels are described by an imprecise frequency descriptor. Study Two presented consumers with a list of side effects preceded by an imprecise frequency descriptor. Consumers were then asked to estimate the relative likelihood of side effect occurrence. The results indicated that consumers are unable to accurately estimate the relative likelihood of side effect occurrence when a list of side effects are preceded by an imprecise frequency descriptor. The pattern of consumer response across both studies indicates that when imprecise frequency descriptors are used to describe the incidence of side effects within the context of direct to consumer prescription drug advertising, consumers estimate likelihood of side effect occurrence on the basis of an intuitive judgment of the side effect's commonness/severity within the general population. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article offers specific guidelines to effective report writing: (1) It discusses the key issues in which top corporate personnel are most interested and explains how to present these issues in an informative manner; (2) it gives an organizational structure designed to facilitate report writing and to maximize reader interest by grouping ideas and concepts in a logical sequence; and (3) it details basic techniques on how to overcome writer's block, reinforce major points, and use charts, graphs, and illustrations to make a report visually appealing as well as easily readable."An effective organizational structure can enhance two-way information flow as well as facilitate project supervision and control.

Research has illustrated that undergraduate student writing skills have not improved even though most states have begun writing proficiency tests at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. By the time students enroll in college, students are expected to be proficient writers. In some cases, this is true. In far too many cases, students continue to need writing development. In business communication classes, these weaknesses cannot be ignored. This article's purpose is to give guidance to instructors to motivate their students to produce better written products. The difficulty is how to do this most effectively. The authors present some ideas on how to improve student writing through some creative teaching and evaluation strategies.""This study investigates nurses' perceptions of a “Management by Wandering Around” program at a large midwestern hospital.

The technical editor almost always depends on authors for his livelihood, since they submit the original manuscripts and research reports which he turns into the final product. The interaction between writers and editors often leaves both with bad feelings. To help the new technical editor prevent this, eleven guidelines for developing a good style of communication are presented.

The workshop consisted of a four-phase process of iterative questioning: identifying audience, defining project goals, formulating feasible outcomes, and assembling relevant evidence and support. © 2010 IEEE.""Many science students believe that scientific writing is most impressive (and most professionally acceptable) when impersonal, dense, complex, and packed with jargon. In particular, they have the idea that legitimate scientific writing must suppress the subjectivity of the human voice. But science students can mature into excellent writers whose voices are clear, interesting, unburdensome, efficient, and accurate. To do this, they must abandon their ponderous scientific voices and use techniques that produce good style. When I teach for the Science Communication Center at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, I focus on helping students improve their scientific voice. I use workshop-style instruction, review of student writing, tutorial staff, and free online tutorials that I have developed. This article meditates upon the nature of good scientific voice as it analyzes examples of student writing to show improvements made through specific stylistic techniques. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""A nonnative speaker of English makes many mistakes in writing English that are dependent on his/her own language. We are able to devise a robust writer’s aid program if we take this point into consideration. In this paper, we identify the idiosyncratic errors that Japanese-English users make in writing English and show an effective way to improve spelling checkers for use by these writers. © 1990 IEEE""This article emphasizes four syntactic-rhetorical imperatives which make written messages easier to read. 1. Keep subjects and their verbs close together. Since native speakers of English expect verbs to follow subjects closely, any intervening element makes the processing of information difficult. 2. Use appropriate prepositions between nouns to explicitly indicate their semantic relationships. Long nominal phrases are hard to understand because these implicit relationships create ambiguity. 3. Help readers to segment syntactic units correctly. The obstacles to readability in this area are the omission of commas and of the signals of subordination, and the misplacement of modifiers. 4. Match textual sequence with chronological sequence. A bibliography of 10 items is given.""This article reports the results of an experiment that was conducted to determine the impact of media synchronicity theory (MST) training on media-fit behavior, communication quantity, communication quality, and group effectiveness. MST training introduces students to a framework for assessing a media’s capabilities and matching those capabilities to a particular task. From three technical communication courses, 80 participants were randomly divided into two groups and compared using a between-subjects design. The MST training group reported significantly higher levels of media-fit behavior, communication quantity, and the communication-performance qualities of discussion quality, richness, and openness. The article discusses practical ways to implement MST training into technical communication group projects. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.""As virtual teams become more and more important in organizations, understanding how to improve virtual team relational development and meeting outcomes is vital to project success. The objective of this study was to investigate how the dialogue technique that facilitated building of shared understanding in virtual teams can be used to enhance virtual team relational development and decision outcomes in a Chinese cultural context. The results from an experiment demonstrate that the adopted dialogue technique can indeed help team members develop their team relations and enhance their perceived team meeting outcomes. Video-conferencing virtual teams with shared mental models may be engaged as effectively as traditional face-to-face teams. Moreover, this study reveals that the dialogue technique can enhance face-to-face team outcomes. Therefore, the findings of this study have both theoretical and practical implications for helping teams develop shared understanding of effective communication and enhance decision-making outcomes in the Chinese cultural context. © 2009 IEEE.""This article presents a refined iterative development model that may be used to improve the processes related to information development. Specifically, the model is designed to facilitate rapid and incremental delivery and increased quality and efficiency. Method: The refined iterative development model is based on an analysis of models from across a range of industries. The analysis was designed to clearly define what a development model is, the basic phases it contains, and various common uses. The approach to this project was from the perspective of a practicing technical communication professional and project manager. Results: The analysis revealed that development models are visual, conceptual, representational, process-oriented, inventive, and both sequential and iterative. The basic phases common to development models are, generally speaking, Discovery, Planning, Implementation, Review, Refinement, and Release (or Deployment). Common uses include sharing knowledge, facilitating success, enhancing credibility, and demonstrating progress. Conclusion: The analysis and comparison allows for a deeper understanding of what a development model is and how a refined iterative development model can be used to improve processes related to information development. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

The application (DB Cairo) is a passenger information system for public transportation running on mobile phones. Research questions: Is the users' first experience with the application influenced by established communicative patterns, means, and services? Are they used as reference objects? Which attributes of the application are relevant? Is there a leading reference object (prototype)? Do reference objects vary depending on the personal factors age and gender? Literature review: Little is known about user experience in first contact situations regarding passenger information systems. For our investigations, we used a theoretical framework combining Linguistic Evaluation Theory, Prototype Theory, and Linguistic Genre Theory: Evaluations are regarded as an integral part of user experience. Evaluation is conceptualized as an act where a subject evaluates an object with a certain purpose at a certain time by comparing it with other objects. Every object has various attributes - some are relevant for the evaluation, and others are not. Communication quality is seen as a crucial complex attribute for the evaluation of communicative applications. Methodology: We conducted a qualitative study: Data from two user test series (n= 12) with thinking-aloud protocols and retrospective interviews were analyzed with qualitative content analysis procedures. The participants were male and female, age 25-35 or 55-65, mobile-phone users, and multimodal travellers. The tests were conducted in a laboratory with a computer-based mobile-phone emulator. Results and conclusions: Results show that the participants explore the application by comparing its attributes with attributes of reference objects. Reference objects vary depending on attributes of the application. Regarding topic-related attributes, participants rely on established artifacts, which form a topic-related multimedia network. Within this network, the website of German Railways functions as prototype. Age- and gender-specific differences were not detected. The findings indicate that research into user experience and development practice could benefit from reconstructing and analyzing topic-related artifacts. Limitations of the study were a small sample size, the test location, and environment. Future challenges are the investigation of influencing factors and the development of new methods/tools for data collection in field studies. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""The key to good vendor-client relations has three elements: a mutual understanding of the publishing process, a specific proposal, and a binding contract.

This study examines the role of citations both as reward and as rhetoric. The reward system was examined by tracing over time the citation patterns of 13 research articles by two groups of scientists in chaos theory. The rhetorical practices were examined by determining how these articles were cited, by reviewing 609 citations of the 13 research articles. The analysis revealed that scientists consistently used five rhetorical practices: (1) using citations in the introduction, (2) using authors' names in the citation, (3) using the citation in a statement that asserts a high level of certainty, (4) using citations to create a research space, and (5) combining the use of the authors' names with placement in the introduction. These features indicated the articles' centrality in scientific discourse.""Although the passive voice may be overused in legal prose, warnings in legal writing guidebooks against the passive risk undervaluing its many uses.

It examines the effects of the genre shift from original research reports to ceremonial speeches, revealing significant differences from Fahnestock's analysis of the genre shift from forensic research reports to epideictic articles in the popular press, especially a move toward greater candidness about the research process. Epideictic scientific rhetoric, therefore, can be said to celebrate the scientific method in general as much as it does the particular line of research at hand. © 2007 Sage Publications.""In partially distributed teams, where some members are co-located while others are geographically distant, co-located members tend to treat one another as a preferential ""Us' versus treating distant members as the outsiders, ""Them.' Research questions: (1) To what extent is Us-vs.-Them reported as a problem across a wide number of organizational partially distributed teams, and is it significantly related to team effectiveness? (2) What do members see as the greatest challenges to partially distributed teams? and (3) Can partially distributed teams overcome in-group dynamics? If so, how? Literature review: In our literature review, we begin by discussing in-group dynamics to set the theoretical framework for our research. We call these dynamics us versus them (Us-vs.-Them) and show, through empirical studies and organizational studies, what makes partially distributed teams especially susceptible to such dynamics. The major susceptibility factors we find are: limited synchronous availability, conflicting goals and responsibilities, and uneven communication channels. We then review literature that exemplifies conflict in such teams (even if it is not the focus of the study). We attempt to relate the resulting conflict or problem reported to the susceptibility factors identified. Methodology: We use qualitative and quantitative analysis from a survey of 238 professionals, recruited through snowball sampling, reporting on their experiences in partially distributed teams. Snowball sampling limits generalizability of the findings. Results and conclusions: We find that Us-vs.-Them can be traced back to the susceptibility factors that exist in partially distributed teams, particularly an imbalance in communication channels between versus within subgroups. A strong negative correlation between Us-vs.-Them and effectiveness indicates the importance of future research on Us-vs.-Them reduction. A key finding is that some survey respondents report effective outcomes despite Us-vs.-Them; these responders also report different concerns than those who view their teams as ineffective. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""With the widespread use of offset lithographic printing for scientific and technical journals, the publisher often gains a cost advantage by combining type and art copy on the page mechanical or repro proof. The art or illustrative copy takes the form of an intermediate print, whether the original is a line drawing or continuous-tone photograph. The complete page mechanical is then treated by the lithographer as a line shot. An economical method of manufacturing high-quality intermediate prints for both line and continuous-tone original art is explained. Suggestions are offered on how to set up an in-house camera operation with emphasis on equipment and staffing requirements. The economic and schedule advantages of an in-house camera operation are also discussed.""An in-house editorial-tutorial program tailored to the communication needs of researchers (physicians and scientists) derives training exercises from the author's manuscript and implants improved forms directly back into the paper.

The message of reporting clearly defines the problem at hand; however, reporting inadequacies have prevented that message from reaching the public. Reporting in the past has suffered due to strong censorship and ignorance from learning about technical contributions in society. Progress has been made through art and increased faith in scientific discoveries which were monumental enough to have wakened man's mind. Through the institutional changes in our education programs, technical reporting will become adequate and allow mankind to live with a mutual understanding.""As institutions of higher education strive to serve students who are diverse and geographically dispersed, many of them are implementing distance education pro grams using technology-mediated communication. Research reveals that distance education is often as effective as traditional education; however, teachers and stu dents are confronted with a variety of obstacles. Thus educators need to determine the most effective and efficient methods of communicating with distance students. An examination of e-mail messages sent to the instructor of an MBA class by dis tance students reveals that the volume of messages sent depends on students' tech nology proficiency, ability to process and seek out information, topic affinity, and relational needs. Furthermore, the findings reveal that an instructor can decrease the volume of messages received by researching the student population, communi cating proactively, and taking advantage of the messaging system's tools. © 2002, Sage Publications.

The bases for such charges are examined, as well as the percentage of income that they provide for several nonprofit journals. The conclusion reached is that a system of financing that spreads the recovery of costs equitably among various sources is desirable. It provides a nonprofit operation which, by its very nature, cannot build large reserves with the flexibility to shift the proportion contributed by the various sources if income from any particular source declines.""Commercial and nonprofit publishers share certain characteristics: both require sufficient income from all sources to pay the costs of publication and distribution, and both have access to the same sources of supply for composition, paper, printing, binding, etc. Commercial publishers seek a profit above costs to obtain a satisfactory return on investment, whereas nonprofit publishers are basically concerned with recovering costs. Professional society publishers have advantages in regard to government subsidies not available to commercial publishers; a built-in and sometimes guaranteed membership market; access to society resources; and the loyalty of society members as subscribers. Commercial publishers' advantages include the discipline imposed by capital investment risks and profit objectives.""This article examines 3 papers presented before the Cincinnati Academy of Medicine by 19th-century physician Julia W.

As a result of technological and global factors, the complexity of delivering successful e-learning courses and products is an increasing challenge for subject matter experts and instructional designers. Online training courses have become blended learning environments, comprised of synchronous and asynchronous modes of delivery, multiple media forms, and global and localized audiences to meet the demands and flexibility it affords. Successful blended e-learning is more than simply mixing online and live instructional modes; it can also include a combination of multiple media types, technologies, and communication modes. E-learners have become multimodal learners, with the ability to adapt to multiple media forms, environment types, and tools. Key concepts: Understanding the complex interaction of technology use, collaborative knowledge sharing, and media can facilitate more effective communication exchanges between instructor, content, and learner. Some concepts that help describe the complexities of blended e-learning include technological appropriation, technological accommodation, media richness, media synchronicity and naturalness, blended e-learning, and collaborative knowledge sharing. Key lessons: Research trends suggest learners appropriate technology and media forms, and evaluate usefulness based on a range of factors, including richness, experience, perception, and recommendation. Blended learning environments add complexity by mixing spatial (distributed and colocated) and temporal (asynchronous and synchronous) components with increased levels of collaborative knowledge sharing. From these research trends, the following best practices for developing e-learning are recommended: (1) consider media richness factors and user preferences in media and tool selection; (2) encourage personalization to foster trust; (3) facilitate collaborative knowledge sharing both inside and outside the training setting; (4) balance roles as knowledge facilitator, coach, and information manager; and (5) invest additional time in both course and instructor preparation. Implications: Blended e-learning presents a number of challenges for subject matter experts and designers of instructional content. Subject matter experts must consult with instructional designers and consider the different media platforms, environments, and formats that optimize the best pairing of content with delivery mode and media type. Content experts and designers must collaborate on methods of effectively adapting course content to account for perceived richness, user experience, and task complexity. Instructors must also invest additional time in planning and accounting for user preferences and communication practices in online training. © 2012 IEEE.""Problem: E-learning has become a standard in many organizations to train its workforce and build an information network that encourages collaborative knowledge sharing.

That they can effectively increase accessibility among users not necessarily sharing a common language speaks to their potential usefulness in other situations. A homeless shelter in a western North Carolina community received funding to build a new facility. With the clientele's widely diverse communication abilities, including those who are illiterate or have limited reading skills, those who are non-native speakers knowing little to no English, and those who are coming from different cultural contexts, a visual sign system was designed to facilitate navigation for all visitors. Using Peirce's theory of signs, Neurath's ISOTYPE, and the least action principle borrowed from physics as a framework, this case study shows how the signs were designed and usability tested to ensure increased accessibility. © 2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""One step to success in writing for publication which many a writer ignores or treats lightly is a thorough analysis of the articles in the journal in which he or she wishes to publish. Chances of manuscript acceptance rise with an accurate analysis because the author gives the editor more nearly what he needs.

Without proper guidance by skilled English language instructors at the very beginning of their graduate program, these newly arrived students may find themselves at a great disadvantage in the American classroom because they invariably lack the necessary aural comprehension and oral proficiency to take advantage of the learning environment. A pilot program at Tennessee Tech has demonstrated that the international student's ability to process technical and nontechnical English efficiently in oral and aural modes can be significantly improved without requiring the student to take time-consuming intensive English programs on arrival in the U. S. Concentrated aural practice in the areas of listening acuity, inferencing, and problem solving yielded dramatic gains in proficiency over a relatively short period of time. Graduate faculty members have reported vast improvements in student attitude and in course work, as well as greater ease in communicating with these unusually industrious students."This article examines how the levels of student interaction change through the use of small groups and moderators in online writing courses. The study examines three technical and professional online writing courses: one course that employs small groups and group moderators and two courses that have no small groups or moderators.

Methods of individual instruction are explored, including personal assessment of strengths and weaknesses, individualization of course goals, time management, and the reduction of communication anxiety. Methods of group instruction are also detailed, including different types of oral presentations the technologist might be expected to make, building a professional attitude, the professional portfolio, and out-of-class speaking experience. Two premises form the basis for these methods. First, that a strong individual approach will significantly increase competencies in oral communication while reducing anxiety. And second, that emphasizing a professional attitude will encourage the student to work to his capacity in improving his competencies, and will prepare him to be a more effective professional.""A significant problem in technical communication is persuading the user that the information is accurate, valid, and useful. All too often, technical communicators treat users as members of their own culture. When authors do consider cultural issues, they often focus on matters such as vocabulary, visuals, and organization. Other strategies, however, can be useful in gaining acceptance of technical information in cross-cultural situations. For example, the communication theory of compliance-gaining offers suggestions for how the technical communicators can adapt the text to enhance user acceptance when communicating to members of their own culture as well as when communicating across cultures. Communicators can use promises, threats, demonstrate positive and negative outcomes, extend friendliness, etc., to develop the text. In this article, I will explain several compliance-gaining strategies authors can use, identify rhetorical strategies they can combine with compliance-gaining strategies, show how these strategies can be effective in a cross-cultural environment by comparing the strategies in two sample cultures, and analyze a brief sample.""A method is proposed for writing journal papers in increments during the progress of the engineering project in a way that will actually aid the development work. Papers written in this manner are not merely a report of work done in the laboratory; instead, they combine the discipline of formal writing with the discipline of engineering effort. The proposed method applies to any kind of engineering manuscript; theoretical, analytical, experimental, or developmental. Specific guidelines are offered for preparing a manuscript in this way and some unique advantages of the method are shown.""No one doubts that indexes are of value to readers. But they can also be of value to their own authors as editing tools. Because an index provides a microcosm of the main text, errors in that text will often be reflected in the index, and reflected in a way that makes them more visible. As he creates the index, the author can use it to spot errors in the body of the work - errors of terminology, of arrangement, of proportion, and of omission. This technique can be used to supplement the normal editing process."Describes some usability issues resulting from conversion of paper documents to Adobe PDF format Reports that users preferred the full-text search tools but got more accurate results with an electronic back-of-the-book index"Online indexing has great potential as a tool for information retrieval, although current online indexes are not always well used. Research and experience indicate that online indexing can be most effective if it is approached as a combination of traditional indexing and using computer search capabilities. Typical search facilities have great power but tend to rely on complex algorithms or else retrieve more information than users can effectively sort through. Traditional indexing techniques serve as a filter for concepts to limit searches to information that users will actually find valuable. To take full advantage of search facilities, online indexes can be designed with a flat (nonhierarchical) structure in which each index entry is clearly worded and makes use of keywords from the subject matter. Indexers can include additional keywords as synonyms that point to the relevant index entries. When indexers take advantage of these concepts and when index users clearly understand what to expect from online indexes, then the indexes become an extremely powerful retrieval medium.""In submitting articles to some journals and bulletins, authors are responsible for indexing their own works. Indexing consists of identifying concepts and translating those concepts into indexing terms appropriate to the discipline and to indexing constraints. The constraints help an author/indexer decide how to determine the number and specificity of terms. In some systems indexing vocabulary is controlled by a thesaurus, which helps in selecting terms and considering alternatives. Authors as indexers shoould pursue the goal of all indexing - to match indexing assignments to the terms most likely to be chosen by prospective readers.""This paper discusses the classic strategy of using buffer sentences to soften bad-news and sales messages.

Although critical topes such as conflict, coordination, and trust are being addressed, research on creativity in virtual teams has been quite limited. Given that creative solutions to complex problems create and sustain a firm's competitive advantage, an investigation of creativity in virtual teams is warranted. The goal of the current study is to explore the influences on creativity in asynchronous virtual teams. Predicated upon grounded theory, this exploration is accomplished through an in-depth qualitative analysis of the team communication transcripts of ten virtual teams. Teams were composed of graduate students who interacted solely via an asynchronous computer conferencing system to develop the high-level requirements and design for a new innovative product. Significant inhibitors to the creative performance of virtual teams included dominance, domain knowledge, downward norm setting, lack of shared understanding, time pressure, and technical difficulties. Significant enhancers to creativity included stimulating colleagues, the existence of a variety of social influences, a collaborative team climate, and both the surfacing and reduction of equivocality. © 2005 IEEE.""Interviews with 14 technical communicators reveal that skills in rhetorical invention help them creatively address communication problems they define creativity in relation to four interrelated exigencies of invention: thinking like a user, reinvigorating dry content, inventing visual ideas, and alternating between heuristic and algorithmic processes they recognize intrinsic factors such as curiosity and sympathy as motivations for their creativity, while being conscious of the external factors (people, money, and time) that may restrain creativity. © 2015 © 2015 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Large amounts of data have been collected in dee- tronic databases by government agencies, universities, and private organizations.

Initially, internationalization concentrated on the outer layers of culture, such as avoiding specific colors and inappropriate icons, as well as incorporating local currency and time standards. While internationalizing these features contributes to an effective online environment across culture, they represent the initial stages of internationalization and localization requirements. Fortunately, current international information architecture research provides useful guidelines and heuristics for localizing online information. This article explores the claim that current internationalization and localization efforts presume particular cultural values and that an effective online environment for international audiences requires structural or architectural reconsideration. Using a Japanese deliverable as a model, this examination maps cultural dimensions to different elements of information architecture. The result of this examination provides suggestions for future internationalization and localization projects.""Examines how the screen size, text-based design, and cumbersome interfaces of PDAs affect information search and retrieval Charts a framework for understanding differences between handheld and desktop Web environments, and identifies issues for research"Briefly outlines the evolution of Information design in Europe and speculates on reasons for the differences in approach to information design in Europe and North America. Maintains that quality of communication is key to both approaches."The new advances in electronic publishing systems and technology offer opportunities to dramatically cut the time and cost of producing documentation. These innovations ultimately increase the amount of information available. Yet this fact only underscores the critical need for new ways to make that end product information (documentation) more usable, accessible, and effective. The technology must be combined with the tools of information design. Using techniques based on current cognitive research, information design structures and predigests the content to increase end user comprehension, productivity, and effectiveness.""Reports a discussion of the Advisory Council for Information Development Management  Comments on the expectation of greater productivity, the need for better quality and usability, and the need for innovative leadership and effective organization.""The dissemination of scientific information in society involves interfaces among a number of publics, a wide variety of formal and informal channels, and human factors such as the reading habits of users. While librarians, scholars, journal editors, and publishers have conducted their own studies, there is a need for examining the entire process of information dissemination from a ″systemic″ framework. Such a framework focuses on the efficiency of the total system as a criterion to generate attractive policy alternatives, i. e. , by trying to minimize the total of all costs incurred at each stage of the author-publisher-library-user chain. This brings an increased emphasis on the interfaces between the various participants in the information dissemination system, analyses of which serve to clarify decisions regarding synoptic publications, interlibrary loans, etc.""The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) is the major source for information on government research and development and analyses. NTIS ships 11,500 information products each day, supplying, therefore, close to 4 million documents and microforms annually. Of this total, about 1,500,000 microforms (mostly fiche, 4 multiplied by 6 inches) were sent out in 1974, much of it through the Selected Research in Microfiche (SRIM), an automatic biweekly system in which microfiche are distributed to users in an extremely flexible system.

The system employs 24 multiplied by fiche, although older parts of the collection may be 20 multiplied by .""Professional communication scholars have critiqued the idea that visual styles derived from cognitive theories of human perception can be universally understood by all people and thus effective in all rhetorical situations. Cognitive heuristics, or mental shortcuts that influence how individuals make decisions, provide a framework for reconciling the perceptual features of visualizations with the cultural and contextual features of particular rhetorical situations. This article analyzes information graphics using the heuristics of representativeness, availability, and affect, applying this analysis to a techne of visual design that accounts for both intuitive and contextual reasoning. © The Author(s) 2015""Much of the empirical research on the effectiveness of different instructional designs has focused on declarative tasks, where a learner acquires knowledge about a certain topic. It is unclear to what extent findings for learning declarative tasks (which are not consistent on all aspects) carry over to learning procedural tasks, where a learner acquires a certain skill. In this paper, we describe an experiment studying a specific kind of procedural instructions, namely exercises for the prevention of repetitive strain injury (RSI), taking information modality (text versus picture versus film clip) and difficulty degree of the exercises (easy versus difficult) into account. In the experiment, participants had to learn RSI exercises and were asked to execute them. The results showed that an instruction in a picture lead to the shortest learning times followed by an instruction in a film clip. An instruction in text led to the longest learning times. For the amount of practicing the exercises during the learning phase, it was found that the participants in the film clip condition hardly engaged in practicing the exercises during the learning phase. The participants in the picture condition engaged in a moderate amount of practicing of the exercises during the learning phase. The participants in the text condition engaged in the most practicing during the learning phase. The results concerning the execution times showed that an instruction in a picture led to the lowest execution times followed by an instruction in a film clip. The instruction in text led to longest execution times. Finally, for the amount of correctly executed exercises, it was found that learning from a film clip led to the highest learning performance, both for easy and for difficult exercises. Learning from an instruction in text led to a fairly good learning performance, both for easy and difficult exercises. Learning from a picture led to a good learning performance for the easy exercises, but the performance dropped for the difficult exercises. © 2008 IEEE.""The article discusses the development of systems of information retrieval as it relates to communication research.

Past literature suggests that the physical accessibility of a knowledge source, the information quality of the source, and relational concerns influence such a choice. This study extends past literature by suggesting that formal structural factors are also important. Particularly, job interdependence, competition, and supervisory relationships are hypothesized to affect information-sourcing frequency. Our social-network analysis of an information systems project team indicates that formal structural factors are important to the development of informal networks and the perception of the information quality of a source. They have direct and indirect impacts on sourcing behavior. Implications for information systems project management are discussed. © 2010 IEEE.""By carefully applying the principle of information structuring, writers can explain difficult concepts to nonspecialist readers. Information structuring refers to the way pieces of information are related to allow readers to gain a clear understanding of the new knowledge that the writer is trying to explain. This structure allows writers to explain new ideas and concepts by comparing them to knowledge that readers already understand. To illustrate this principle the paper discusses the use of analogy in technical explanation and the use of repetition to emphasize key concepts.""Work activities that are mediated by information rely on the production of discourse-based objects of work. Designs, evaluations, and conditions are all objects that originate and materialize in discourse. They are created and maintained through the coordinated efforts of human and non-human agents. Genres help foster such coordination from the top down, by providing guidance to create and recreate discourse objects of recurring social value. From where, however, does coordination emerge in more ad hoc discursive activities, where the work objects are novel, unknown, or unstable? In these situations, coordination emerges from simple discursive operations, reliably mediated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) that appear to act as discursive agents. This article theorizes the discursive agency of ICTs, explores the discursive operations they mediate, and the coordination that emerges. The article also offers and models a study methodology for the empirical observation of such interactions.""This is a selective, annotated bibliography of 86 references on technological innovations that have had or are expected to have an impact on libraries. It generally covers references appearing in the late 1970s through 1980.

While a few might argue that we are in danger of being swallowed up by large, institutional realignments, it seems more likely that the future workplace (as characterized by Senge, among others) will put communication, culture, and collaboration at the center of work. However, in order for the profession to exploit these opportunities, we must understand the impact of integrated information technology (IT) on organizations. I summarize the interaction of corporate culture, leadership/management, human resources, and advanced networking and web-based applications (more commonly called an Intranet) for the successful integration of new IT products into an established and well-defined organization. Background research for this paper was conducted as part of an Army Summer Faculty Research and Engineering grant.""Adopting the supply chain paradigm, we define customer service as a multifunctional sequence of process activities supported by an intricate tapestry of information technology (IT) and non-IT resources that enable the coordination and communication necessary to create value for the customer. The resource-based view (RBV) serves as our theoretical lens for assessing the strategic contributions of IT in the customer-service process of third-party logistics firms. Our findings support the RBV assertion of significant direct and indirect impacts but suggest that the challenges of fully integrating IT resources as process components go beyond merely leveraging complementarity, as emphasized by RBV. © 2006 IEEE.""The newest development in office automation is the information-processing system. Its capabilities include not only word processing but also decision-support and administrative-support functions. While the article makes brief mention of some new system capabilities that would be of only passing interest to the average technical communicator, it concentrates on those new capabilities that would be of interest to technical communicators who are either using such systems to write or edit technical material themselves or who are in charge of acquiring and making effective use of such systems within technically oriented organizations.""In an industrial society, the library is associated with modern economic, political, and social metanarratives. With the rise of digital technology, public libraries are threatened with the possibility of becoming obsolete and irrelevant. Spaces and interfaces intersect with modern and postmodern narratives as the library vies to establish its identity as a legitimizer and purveyor of knowledge in the information age. Through architecture, the library comes to speak the language of hybridity to reassert its relevance and reposition itself.""The author argues that all too often teachers of technical writing spend too much time pressuring their students to write simply and without jargon, and that as a result they often get writing that is bad because it is skeletal and undeveloped writing lacking in continuity and narrative functions. The technical writer is often overjoyed to submit outline-writing because it requires small effort, not realizing that it shifts the burden of interpretation to the reader. The author recommends a number of cures for the skeletal technical paper.""The editor of Science magazine describes how a special Energy Issue which was aimed at informing the intellectual community on the many aspects of the energy crisis, was conceived, planned, and published with a very tight production schedule.""Partially distributed teams (PDTs) are virtual teams that consist of at least two distinct geographically dispersed subgroups that communicate mainly through information and communication technology (ICT). As such teams become increasingly prevalent, it is important to understand how to manage them to maximize team effectiveness. The perceptions of effectiveness of PDTs may be significantly decreased when they are characterized by ingroup dynamics, consisting of preferential attitudes and actions toward collocated members, with accompanying conflict and lack of trust in regard to the distant subteam(s). Research questions: Do ingroup dynamics negatively impact perceptions of effectiveness in PDTs and, if so, how strongly? What factors can lessen ingroup dynamics - specifically, can training or reliable ICT support decrease ingroup dynamics? Does organizational context affect these relationships? Does whether or not the PDT is international affect these relationships? Does the number of subgroups in a PDT affect these relationships? Literature review: Social identity theory suggests how ingroup dynamics may emerge and create fault lines between subteams in a PDT. Effectiveness is defined in terms of process performance, which refers to how well the teamwork process has been undertaken. Prior research suggests that ICT reliability and training for work in distributed teams may decrease ingroup dynamics and improve effectiveness. International members, the specific organizational context, and the number of subteams per team might moderate these relationships. Methodology: An online survey of professionals with experience in PDTs was conducted, with two subsamples - one from a single large telecommunications company and one from a mix of organizations. Partial least squares regression was used to build and test a model of the relationships among the variables measured. Results: Ingroup dynamics have a strong negative relationship with perceived effectiveness. Overall, technology reliability and training significantly reduce ingroup dynamics. In the telecommunications company, training increased ingroup dynamics; thus, training may not always be beneficial, depending on organizational culture and the modes and types of training provided by a specific organization. Neither international membership on the team nor the number of subgroups per team was a significant multigroup moderator on any path in our model. Conclusions: These results help to extend social identity theory into this domain as they elucidate specifically that ICT reliability and training promote effectiveness of PDTs and that ingroup dynamics affect the perceptions of effectiveness in such teams. The results give managers guidance on what issues of PDTs to focus on to promote the effectiveness of PDTs. © 2016 IEEE.""As is true for engineering communication programs nationwide, at MIT curricular and pedagogical reforms have been driven by changes in the kinds of problems that engineers solve and the associated skill sets that engineers must now have in communication and teamwork. This article presents three case studies from communication-intensive classes at MIT that intend to help students develop the advanced communication skills required of professional engineers today. Highlighting classes in biological engineering, aeronautics/astronautics engineering, and biomedical engineering, we explore the following questions: What does it mean for educational practice if professional communication competencies and tasks are the goals? How can students and technical faculty best create the conditions for students to learn to be skilled team members? How can engineering students move from mere display of data to making skilled visual arguments based on those data? The importance of helping students meet the target competencies of professional practice, of teaching effective teamwork and collaboration, and of teaching students to understand and argue with visual data are recognized as widespread needs, and these case studies attest to the possibilities and challenges in meeting those needs. © 2008 IEEE.""We can improve the validity and reliability of business communication research by using both quantitative and qualitative methods and studying both real life and simulations. Studies should build on both American research on strategy and innovation and European research on psycholinguistics and perception. Studies of culture need to consider not only national culture but also corporate and professional culture; studies need to investigate new media. Quantitative simulated repeated multiple-case research might increase reliability. Studying real-life events increases ecological validity. Studying psychology, language, and the right culture provides content validity. These principles are illustrated with research about intercultural negotiations. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""The innovation literature suggests a number of proactive roles (e.g., idea generator, idea champion, and orchestrator) that organizational members can play in the development and implementation of innovations. This study examines self-report data gathered at two points in time from organizational members (N = 90) within the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS), a geographically-dispersed federal government health information and education network that is piloting innovative intervention strategies to disseminate cancer information to the public. Unexpectedly, results indicate that those who have the power to champion innovation are also capable of challenging it, suggesting the existence of a new innovation role held by organizational members who object to innovation adoption or innovation: the devil's advocate. The discussion explores implications for research and practice that challenge traditional notions about roles that people play in the innovation process. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""A global economy requires business organizations to cultivate their international holdings by respecting the national differences of their host countries and coordinating efforts for rapid innovation. In this essay we first review relevant literature in the areas of communication and innovation and explore how efforts toward innovative practices are directly related to globalism and business strategy.

However, the use of IM as a communication tool to support task completion is not well understood. This article reports on an exploratory mixed methods study investigating the use of IM as a communication tool to support task completion and multitasking in information technology organizations. The main purpose was to investigate IM use to support two types of tasks: collaboration and conflict tasks. We used a mixed methods approach incorporating quantitative and qualitative data from interviews and survey instruments. Results from the quantitative analysis suggest a significantly greater use of IM for collaboration tasks than for cognitive conflict tasks. The qualitative data helped in identifying specific tasks in the information technology corporate environment whose completion is supported by IM use. Those tasks were mapped into an existing task framework and analyzed using qualitative methods. Results from the qualitative analysis were used to complement and support the quantitative findings. A secondary goal of this article was to explore the use of IM to support multitasking. Descriptive results on use of IM to multitask are presented. The article concludes with a discussion of the main implications of this study for communication managers. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article examines the development and implementation of a strategic cultural change program from a case study perspective. Initially, the article describes how the program was developed, including an explanation as to how a communication component was integrated into the program from inception. This integration helped reduce the anxiety that change programs traditionally initiate. Additionally, the article examines preliminary findings captured during the program’s implementation. These findings provide generalized insights about ways communication, strategy, and cultural change programs interact. As such, the findings provide real-world support that communication facilitates organizational change. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""Our study focuses on how students collaborate online to produce specific written genres, using particular collaborative technologies to work together productively, and how instructor feedback and student perspectives on collaborative work influence those activities in online classrooms. Research questions: When composing using collaborative web-based writing applications, do students focus primarily on the interface or the text space? What kinds of expectations about collaborative writing do students bring to the interface and text space? To what extent can we characterize students' acknowledgement of a third space, what we have identified as 'communicative interaction?' Literature review: Workplace collaboration is important because organizations increasingly demand effective collaborators, team members, and team leaders, and technologies for sharing, cobuilding, and feedback are readily available to support these activities. Student preparation for workplace collaboration is important because students struggle when they are asked to write together, particularly when the collaborative process involves new technologies, and yet knowledge of collaborative writing strategies and experience with collaborative technologies, such as Google Docs, are the very competencies that organizations expect of them. Methodology: Thirteen groups of 3 to 4 technical writing students and science communication students enrolled in online professional writing courses at a major research university wrote feature specifications and reports on the globalization of the sciences, respectively, using Google Docs within Google Drive. Sixteen of 37 students responded to a set of questions asking them to reflect on their experiences working collaboratively, learning new genres, using the collaborative environment, and revising with instructor feedback. Results and conclusions: We found that students struggled most with adapting their already established collaborative strategies grounded in face-to-face learning situations to an online learning environment, where they felt their means of communication and expression were limited. The results suggest that effective collaborative experiences, properly executed, represent a repertoire of competencies that go well beyond only technical considerations, such as being able to effectively assign roles, set milestones, and navigate the numerous tasks and processes of writing as a team. The small number of students and the single instructor with her own particular feedback style limit the study. Future research includes looking at how different feedback styles influence student collaborative writing. © 1988-2012 IEEE."This article summarizes a dissertation study designed to determine the effectiveness of instructional interventions that focus on proofreading and editing skills of first-year college students enrolled in business communication courses. The study used a pretest-posttest quasiexperimental control group design and collected data from 56 participants based on the results of the Grammar and Mechanics Diagnostic Assessment for two experimental groups and a control group. The results of the project were compiled and analyzed using descriptive statistics and a repeated measures analysis of variance. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication."The instructional product review procedure is discussed from a generic and systematic viewpoint. As conceived, the process is composed of the phases of planning, implementation, and analysis with each converging on a series of generic concerns. Planning pivots upon getting a sample of the product, stating the claims to be associated with the product, and defining the administrative and technical aspects of implementation. Implementation highlights the monitoring and expediting function of the developer as the reviewer responds to the product. Analysis addresses the wrap-up issues of an editorial proofing of the reviewer's comments, a debriefing of the reviewer, and data processing. To elucidate matters, sample materials are furnished which could be used to review a module or instructional package.""This study aims to assess the quantity and quality of Spanish translations in user manuals for electronic products written in the United States within the last five years. While we cannot reasonably offer culturally appropriate translations for every language and cultural group represented in the United States, recent immigration patterns from Mexico strongly suggest a growing need for accurate translation into Spanish. First, I discuss why we need culturally-appropriate Spanish translations in user manuals for electronic products, how cultural differences can affect perceptions of technical communication in other cultures, and the role that the technical communicator can play in making translations more culturally appropriate. Next, I discuss my assessment of 60 user manuals for electronic products. The findings of this study indicate that much more work needs to be done in the area of localization and translation to make the Spanish language versions of the manuals usable for a Mexican or Mexican-American audience.""In many business communication courses students must write a business report. This study compared what business communication instructors believe their students learn and what writing skills they improve by completing the assignment with what students believe they learn and what writing skills they believe are improved. Data were gathered from members of the Association for Business Communication and from students who have completed a business report. Instructors see greater improvement in student writing skills than do students. To close this gap, faculty should offer more explicit explanations of the assignment and of the con cepts to be learned and the skills to be improved. They should also explain the cri teria for evaluation and help students assess their writing skills and set personal goals for improvement. Questionnaires are provided so instructors can compare their own perceptions with those of their students as well as with the instructors and students from this study. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Communication plays an important role in the instructor-student relationship, and students judge instructors' ability to teach communication based on their ability to practice what they teach. The authors' empirical study shows that students have higher expectations of their business communication instructors than they do of their other business instructors when it comes to their communication behaviors in and out of the classroom. The authors infer from the data that sensitivity to these expectations can improve student learning and instructor evaluations. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""Results in past studies comparing teaching time and effort in online and face-to-face (FTF) teaching environments have been inconsistent. This research study compares the instructional time and effort it took the authors to teach the same course online and FTF in their respective universities. The authors hypothesize that it takes more time to teach online courses. The results of the two-semester study show that both authors spent more time per student, approximately 20% more, in the online courses. In the total time spent per student online compared to the total time spent per student FTF, the paired-samples t-test showed a statistically significant difference (t(3) = 6.163, p = 0.009). The authors speculate a number of factors contributed to this difference and the perception that teaching in an online environment takes more time and effort than teaching in a FTF environment. © 2009 IEEE.""This article describes a team teaching technique used in executive programs at the University of Southern California.

The purpose of this study was to better measure peer influence in these online communities. Research questions: 1. How can peer influence in online communities be measured in a way that comprehensively incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network? 2. Is the method proposed in this study superior to other existing methods? Literature review: Previous literature on measuring online user influence can be classified into two streams: 1. Those that focus on the intrinsic characteristics of social media players to measure peer influence; 2. Those that address social network structure. Relevant computing algorithms include Topic-Based PageRank, Quality-Structure index, and so on. Although the first stream considers a focal peer's intrinsic characteristics, it overlooks the interpeer attraction in terms of similarity and discrepant knowledge among peers. The second stream mostly stresses the structures of social networks to measure network-wide peer influence but underestimates the effect of interpeer attraction that may leverage every diffusion step of peer influence through the network. To fill this research gap, this study proposes a new method of measuring network user influence that incorporates peers' intrinsic factors, interpeer influence factors as homophily effect, and network structure. Homophily refers to the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar with respect to certain attributes. Methodology: From the communication sender-receiver perspective, we developed a computable method that incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network to measure the social network user influence. Two empirical studies were subsequently conducted in a social network service-based online community and an online professional logistics community to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and conclusions: The empirical results show that our proposed method provides higher prediction accuracy of user influence rank in an online community than the other existing methods. These findings lay a foundation for future theoretical exploration and provide a useful tool for targeting influential users in online communities such as blogs, bulletin board systems, and forums. © 2017 IEEE.""Students in engineering courses can learn technical writing skills without having to spend large amounts of valuable class time.

Technical communication teachers can fill this gap by addressing intercultural issues in the service class. This proposal faces challenges: the lack of class time, teacher training, textbooks, and teaching methods. To address these challenges, this tutorial uses various materials and genre-based instruction to integrate intercultural communication into the service class. This approach helps to raise students' intercultural awareness and sensitivity as they learn engineering communication genres. This tutorial may be used in service classes for other majors. © 2010 IEEE.""This article addresses the advantages of using a business structure in the classroom, the purpose of discussing ethics in the classroom, a design of a classroom business, the methodology needed to implement the activity, an assessment of outcomes, and the results of the exercise. © 1997, Sage Publications.

(2) Is an authentic informative video project in introductory technical writing service courses an effective learning assignment from the students' perspectives?Situating the case: Video has been discussed in technical communication literature since the 1970s and our discussion of video parallels technology development making video production and viewing possible for mainstream consumers. Recently, a revitalization of interest in video (particularly since 2012) reflects widespread adoption of smart phones with video recording capabilities, preinstalled and relatively simple video production applications on computers, video-sharing websites (YouTube), and high-speed internet connections enabling rapid video downloads by viewers. Yet, low-cost and easy-to-use communication technologies are often associated with the idiosyncratic application of design features and often do not transfer into effective communication. We often claim that technical communication programs are well situated to take a 'leadership role' in mastering a new communication technology but our instruction of video has not kept pace with the rapidly evolving technology nor is it necessarily consistent with our own research findings.How this case was studied: In this experience report, I took a teacher-researcher role and triangulated my personal observations with a student-perception questionnaire and other student reflections on the assignment. About the case: The informative video project was used in a junior-level, introductory technical communication service course. The informative video assignment was an experiential learning assignment in which students worked in small teams to develop ""real-world"" communications for a peer audience. The learning objectives emphasized in the project include genre analysis, audience analysis, scriptwriting, visual-verbal communication, video production and technology, and project management and teamwork.Results: The logistics and considerations for developing informative videos in technical communication courses are discussed and student feedback reveals that this assignment was particularly useful for teaching audience analysis, technology skills, verbal-visual synergy of communication channels, and teamwork.Conclusions: Informative videos are a challenging project but offer a unique opportunity to examine audience analysis and teach verbal-visual parallelism.

The single computer tape produced by this processing is used for the photocomposition of the elements involved for the primary journals, as well as for AIP's secondary services including the volume indexes to the primary journals themselves. The reasons for this change in procedure, and its technical and economic aspects are discussed. Possible future developments in the system, which would rely on much greater use of computer processing, and the economic benefits resulting therefrom are explained. Finally, the effects of AIP's secondary-information capabilities on the dissemination of primary information in traditional formats, as well as possible alternative formats, are discussed.""Based on a client project assigned to students in two undergraduate business classes, this article argues that social media learning is best done in a context that mixes social media with more traditional kinds of media. Ideally, this approach will involve teams of students who are working on different aspects of a larger client project. This integrated setup has several benefits: It enhances the students' understanding of social media within a real context, it complements more traditional communication methods, and it reveals the communicative aspects of key business functions. © 2011 Association for Business Communication.""This article offers an example case of technical communicators integrating the social bookmarking site Delicious into existing work environments. Using activity theory to present conceptual foundations and concrete steps for integrating the functionalities of social media, the article builds on research within technical communication that argues for professional communicators to participate more fully in the design of communication systems and software. By examining the use of add-ons and tools created for Delicious, and the customized use of Rich Site Syndication (RSS) feeds that the site publishes, the author argues for addressing the context-sensitive needs of project teams by integrating the functionality of social media applications generally and repurposing their user-generated data. © 2009 Sage Publications.""Previous research has suggested the need for developing technical communication education in Chinese universities. Following this suggestion, this article examines the possibility of integrating technical communication into China's English major curriculum. Based on findings from two universities, the article discusses the design of China's English major curriculum and Chinese teacher and student perspectives on technical communication. The author suggests that China's English for Specific Purposes (ESP) education provides a promising home for integrating technical communication and that this integration can enhance China's current ESP education. The author presents three integration models and discusses questions for future research. ©2011 SAGE Publications.""Workforce communication skills are essential to engineers' job success, but research shows that engineering graduates do not have the level of oral and written communication skills that jobs require. At Georgia Institute of Technology, the results of interviews with engineers, supervisors, and senior executives have been used to integrate workforce communication skills into Industrial Engineering Senior Design. The process used to collect the data is described along with the resulting educational approach. The incorporation of the identified workforce communication skills into the capstone course is then detailed. Preliminary feedback is reported and extensions to other engineering disciplines are discussed. © 2005 IEEE."An integrated approach to teaching rsum construction in the business communication classroom focuses on simultaneously (a) emphasizing writing-related proficiencies and (b) encouraging ethical and moral orientations to this task. This article provides a rsum construction exemplar that operationalizes these two pedagogical goals. The techniques and exercises used in the exemplar are presented as a way to make ethics education accessible for both business communication instructors and students. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication."In October 1994 a mathematics professor informed the Intel Corporation that its Pentium chip had a flaw which caused mathematical errors. Intel's response to the professor and its customers created a backlash of anger and a public relations crisis. By analyzing Intel's actions using the work of two relevant ethical philosophies, this article shows that some of the company's errors in public relations were also ethical errors. However, it also points out that Intel has made improvements which will help it avoid future problems and which could set an ethical precedent for the semiconductor industry.""Do programs in technical communication thrive when administered in English departments or in other configurations of administrative units? This article examines the variations in professional, technical, and scientific communication programs at four universities across the north central U.S. The first three programs have histories that led them to be housed at increasing distances from their universities' English departments. The fourth is a nascent program emerging in its university's English department. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""To assume their roles in corporate culture, business- and technical-communication students must understand the spoken and unspoken discourses of corporate protocol and be aware of the intricacies of these discourses. Students must be knowledgeable about the correct corporate protocol for verbal as well as for nonverbal communication. Teachers can incorporate exercises into business- and technical-communication courses to increase students' awareness of and competence in navigating institutional politics. Learning how to interact successfully will enable students as new employees not only to survive institutional politics but to advance in their professions. © 1990, Sage Publications.

The most distinctive quality of these new technologies is that they are interactive in nature, in that they allow the participants in a communication process to have control over, and exchange roles in, their mutual discourse. Interactive communication technologies usually spread among the members of a system rather slowly until a critical mass of adopters is reached, as the case of Internet illustrates. After the critical mass occurred, the rate of adoption of Internet took off suddenly. Interactive communication provides a relatively high degree of flexibility, which in turn allows the user to have a high degree of control over the technology and the communication that takes place via the new interactive technologies. © 1995, Sage Publications.

According to these authors, FOMM can and should become the standard format for the documentation of future systems, with resulting benefits for all concerned - buyers, contractors, and users. Unlike conventional manuals, which rely on text, a functionally oriented manual is a graphic, visual presentation. Its troubleshooting procedures can be expressed in a flowchart format, allowing adaptability to computer storage and usage. FOMMs provide a natural link with developing technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote diagnostics. Instead of using traditional technical manuals, such an expert system might use computer-based FOMM documentation and remote interactive terminals. For example, a problem could be solved on site by a military technician armed with a remote terminal.""Corporate websites have been the subject of several research endeavors, and most of the research has focused on usability and interactivity. Since the emergence of the term Web 2.0 , more websites have added social features to their base functionality, and this new type of interactivity has yet to be investigated. This study explores the research evolution in this field. Research questions: How has research on interactivity in corporate websites evolved? How can prior research be categorized? In each category, which of the research challenges has little or no research support? Literature review: Our approach to the topic is guided by four major streams of research - (1) the diffusion of innovations theory; (2) the technology, organization, and environment framework; (3) the institutional theory; and (4) the model from Iacovou et, al. The analysis of the evolution of corporate websites showed three common types of corporate websites classified by their purpose and interaction intensity. Corporate websites hereby often benefit from the inclusion of design principles and patterns induced by the term Web 2.0. While examining the characteristics of corporate websites, usability and interactivity were found to be most important with reference to positive user response. Therefore, we clarified the concept of web-based interaction and reviewed the research on consumer response. Methodology: To gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of research on the interactivity in corporate websites, our study conducted a systematic and exhaustive literature review in which we identified and categorized several research issues. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 166 articles and classified relevant contributions by research issue and category. Results and conclusion: Among the identified research issues concerning interactivity that facilitates communication of the organization, only relationship management emerged as a dominant issue. Research issues concerning interactivity that facilitates e-commerce could be found most and they tend to focus on two main areas: decision support systems and recommendation agents on sales-oriented e-commerce websites and loyalty, satisfaction, and trust as key variables. Research issues concerning interactivity for interpersonal communication mainly focus on the user's individual motivation and successive behavior, and contain many different references to computer-mediated interaction and online communities. Research issues in the field of designing for interactivity discuss interface design questions and focus on numerous website characteristics and their impact. Given those issues, we make suggestions for future research that would explore the organizational behavior related to innovation diffusion on corporate websites. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Given the expanding globalized workforce, business educators continue to seek new ways to prepare students for intercultural encounters. Although immersion in other cultures is the optimal strategy, this method is not always feasible. As such, educators seek other mechanisms to simulate intercultural experiences. This study examines emotional intelligence as a predictor of intercultural communication apprehension among university students (N = 425). Results indicate that three of the emotional intelligence subscales predict intercultural communication apprehension: emotionality, sociability, and self-control. These results support the premise that emotional intelligence manages and/or reduces intercultural communication apprehension and therefore should be integrated in business curriculum. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study examines the nature, manifestations and causes of communication problems in international outsourcing engagements. Specifically, it explores a case of business process outsourcing (BPO), which is the transfer of a number of business processes, such as payroll, supply chain management, and customer relations to an external supplier. In this case, a company based in the US outsourced its business processes to a company in India. Research questions: (1) If widespread proficiency in English is the reason for India's predominant position in outsourcing, then why do we hear about communication problems? (2) What are the causes of such problems? (3) In what forms and situations do they manifest? (4) How could technical communication offer solutions to ameliorate or minimize some of these communication problems? Situating the case: Similar cases studied include previous studies of call centers in the Philippines and outsourcing relationships in software companies have identified challenges in those relationships to problems of intercultural communications, such as language use and differences in culture. Three areas of inquiry informed this study. Intercultural communication theories provide frameworks and touch points for assessing the role of culture in communication. Previous studies of outsourcing and offshoring provided definitions of the broad range of arrangements that comprise outsourcing. Although these studies all concluded that communication is a crucial factor in the success of outsourced projects, they offered few details of communication problems, their causes, manifestations, and possible solutions. Accounts of India represent India as a rapidly-growing, dynamic economy with certain typical communication problems. Methodology: The study was designed as a mixed-methods, single-case study with a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data were gathered through surveys that helped develop a picture of patterns in areas such as communication problems, preferred methods of communication, and patterns of escalation while qualitative data from 45 personal interviews and one group interview provided insights into the nature and resolution of communication dissonances. About the case: The case studied ABC Corporation, a captive Indian company that performed BPO for a major American corporation. Communication problems that arise in the outsourcing relationship include differences in corporate culture and differences in linguistic and rhetorical choices. Issues causing these problems include differences in education and training. Conclusions: Ongoing training in cross-cultural communication is needed at all stages of the outsourcing cycle, with an emphasis on communication skills in the early stages of the process, especially the hiring stage. Technical communication can offer solutions to these problems because our field can help structure suitable training applying theories such as Cross' Theory of centripetal and centrifugal forces, which provide frameworks for assessing and addressing communication problems. © 2012 IEEE.""The field of technical communication has made notable progress in researching and teaching intercultural issues. Not enough discussion, however, is available on assessing students' intercultural competence. This article attempts to start this discussion and invite further research.

This article was written by a Chi nese professor of business communication who benefited from a business internship in San Francisco and an American professor of finance who wit nessed cultural differences in business during a recent exchange visit in Shanghai. The article highlights several cultural differences that promote understanding and reduce the difficulties of dealing with these disparate cul tures. The Chinese point of view of these cultural differences makes this article uniquely valuable. © 1997, Sage Publications.

In this article, it is argued that the local organizational context has to be taken into account. By linking Bourdieu's theories on the social organization of differences to recent theories of organizational communication, the focus of the article is directed at describing the impact of informal and power-related aspects in intercultural communication. The usefulness of a theory on intercultural organizational communication is illustrated by the results of an ethnographic field study on Danish expatriates in a Saudi subsidiary. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Engineering students frequently complain that technical communication courses are not relevant to their major area of study.

In the functional specialization explanation, individuals are said to focus on the mix of internal and/or external communication dictated by their formal positions. The communication stars explanation suggests that individuals maintain similar levels of communication in both networks. The cyclical model posits a more dynamic pattern that shifts back and forth between internal and external communication, depending on the consequences of their prior communication behavior. The new organizational form examined for three years was the Cancer Information Service, a geographically dispersed federal government health information program. Our results indicated that there was a lagged effect for the communication stars explanation. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""There is an ongoing debate as to whether cultural differences necessitate adaptation of advertisements to local circumstances in international business communication. In particular, value appeals are thought to be culturally sensitive because cultures differ with respect to which values are considered important, and it is thought that appealing to important values is more persuasive than appealing to ones less important. This article reports on an experiment in which the persuasiveness of an appeal to security was compared to that of an appeal to adventure. The relative persuasiveness of these appeals was studied in countries (i.e., Belgium, France and Spain) that are characterized as high uncertainty avoidance cultures, and a country characterized as a low uncertainty avoidance culture: The Netherlands. Results showed that the two value appeals proved equally persuasive for all countries.""As an increasing number of American businesses become international or global organizations, there is a greater need for employees representing these businesses to be more global in their awareness and understanding of different cultures. As a complete understanding of all aspects of all cultures is probably impossible, training in specific aspects of ""target cultures"" is common and an appropriate and intelligent approach. In understanding these target cultures, however, we suggest that issues related to gender have not been adequately emphasized by programs designed to prepare business representatives for international business. A multi-cultural approach implies that we are simultaneously members of many different cultures - some more dominant than others at times. One of these simultaneous cultural influences is gender. And the influences of gender on intercultural communication are important. We suggest that as a result of the importance cultures place on gender and appropriate gender roles, issues surrounding gender roles have an influence in many international business transactions and require a more careful examination. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""One hundred major corporations, selected through a systematic random sampling technique, were surveyed to identify current practices in international business correspondence. A questionnaire was constructed to determine the foreign countries with which American companies correspond, the languages used in international business letters, the techniques used in translating foreign languages, the differences in letter formats and writing styles, and the communication skills needed by business people who correspond with foreign companies. In addition, samples offoreign business letters received and sent by these firms were analyzed to verify questionnaire responses and to determine technical differences between foreign correspondence received and sent. Sixty-six percent of the questionnaires were returned. Sixty-eight letters were analyzed. Information elicited from the questionnaires was grouped into the following three categories: language, writing style, and skills needed by foreign correspondents. Letter samples were examined for format, writing style, and technical differences. Curricular implications were identified from the analysis of the questionnaire data. © 1984, Sage Publications.

Businesses that trade in the global market have a legal and ethical duty to make their products reasonably safe, and technical communicators who write the documentation for those products have a legal and ethical duty to protect international consumers by writing adequate instructions. Writing documentation for products that will be distributed internationally requires not only the ability to communicate clearly, but also awareness of the relevant product liability laws, the cultural variables, and the expectations of international audiences. This article first argues that devoting company resources to produce adequate instructions for international users is both practical and ethical, then provides a brief overview of the consumer protection measures that the top U.S. trade partners have implemented, and finally presents guidelines for developing adequate instructions for international audiences.""The purpose of this article is to examine pertinent issues regarding the need for a fair use structure in international intellectual property agreements. Method: The issues in this article were examined using a scholarly methodology based on legal research and applied analysis and application to the technical communication field. Results: The findings are that fair use cannot be employed in international intellectual property treaty development because, to operate, it must retain its necessary connection to the U.S. Constitution's goals and policy. Conclusion: International intellectual property law treaty development should incorporate humanistic guidelines that accommodate fair use goals based on universal rights.""The advantages of a one-time printing of military technical manuals that can be used without change by common language military allies is self-evident. The author describes efforts that have been made in this direction by the ABCA nations. In the process the time-honored method of structuring manuals to follow a rigid maintenance philosophy had to yield a more flexible approach. Under this approach, each nation or military service is free to set its own maintenance philosophy independently of the pertinent manual. An interesting potential for eliminating further minor differences in the varied requirements of the military services is thereby suggested.""Standards provide a substantive, internationally supported framework through which information can be managed, developed, reviewed, tested, maintained in a content-management system, and published in a variety of forms. Research question: Why are standards and standards development important for information development and management? Key concepts: (1) The International Organization for Standardization defines a standard as ""a document that provides requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose."" (2) Several types of standards exist, such as unit standards (which describe measures), private standards reached by consensus and that most participants in an industry agree to, and public, de jure, or legally mandated standards. Standards exist for authoring and publishing tools. (3) Using a standard managed and controlled by a standards organization means gaining the insights of experienced individuals working through an internationally recognized body. 4) Standards are developed by consensus under the auspices of a major organization, such as IEEE, ISO, or OASIS. (5) Major standards affecting information development include technical standards for authoring and publishing, including portable document format, eXtensible markup language, Hypertext Markup Language, and content standards, such as Darwin information typing architecture (DITA), DocBook, and S1000D. Key lessons: (1) Use standards to manage content development. (2) Use standards to acquire services to support the development of content. (3) Use standards to review and test information. (4) Use standards to manage agile information development. (5) Use standards to manage the development of documentation through the software-development life cycle. (6) Use standards to select and implement a content-management system. (7) Hire information developers who understand the importance of using standards. Implications to practice: Standards provide a means for information developers to ensure that they are managing and developing content effectively. Implementing standards in an organization helps to ensure that technology choices made today will not restrict future technology developments. © 2016 IEEE.""The ability to use desktop scanners to convert images into digital data for manipulation, enhancement, and eventual incorporation into a publication raises many legal and ethical issues. Furthermore, desktop publishing capabilities now make it possible for anyone to use technology that was available, until recently, only to large publishers. Potential legal problems involve copyright infringement and libel, both of which are familiar concerns to technical writers, although we tend to associate them with text rather than graphic images. Ethical issues raised by the available technology include concerns about enhanced advertisements. To maintain public confidence in digitally processed images, technical communicators in academia must provide guidelines for their students, both U.S. and international, who will encounter many of these legal and ethical issues in the workplace. © 1992 IEEE""Information security and privacy on the internet are critical issues in our society. In this research, we examine factors that influence internet users' private-information-sharing behavior. Based on a survey of 285 preteens and early teens, who are among the most vulnerable groups on the web, this study provides a research framework that explains an internet user's information privacy protection behavior. According to our study results, internet users' information privacy behaviors are affected by two significant factors: (1) users' perceived importance of information privacy and (2) information privacy self-efficacy. The study also found that users believe in the value of online information privacy and that information privacy protection behavior varies by gender. Our findings indicate that educational opportunities regarding internet privacy and computer security as well as concerns from other reference groups (e.g., peer, teacher, and parents) play an important role in positively affecting the internet users' protective behavior regarding online privacy. © 2009 IEEE.""The Internet has brought about changes in the job search and application process. For this article, recruiters at several large commercial banks in the US were inter viewed on the usage of Internet recruiting tools. The interviews identified a number of trends that are fairly uniform across these banks, including the following: 1. Recruiters are using the Internet at an increasing rate. 2. While job site services are popular, most recruiters we interviewed preferred using the corporate Website. 3. The percentage of Internet-recruited applicants actually hired varies widely and is still a small percentage of the whole. 4.

By analyzing authentic verbal communication between middle managers and employees, this article will draw five conclusions about how interpretational work support organizational goals and values: 1. Middle managers and employees collaborate in interpreting tasks in relation to organizational context; 2. This interpretative work is based on language acquisition: learning the vocabulary of the organization; 3. The managers articulate the process, explicitly defining reality and influencing language use; 4. Employees show expectation of having their experiences interpreted by managers; 5. Employees may challenge managers with competing interpretations. This article will contribute to the study of leadership communication by combining organization communication theory and conversation analytic methodology. The article shows important ways in which middle managers ""do leadership"": by contextualizing employee actions and bringing employee perceptions in accordance with executive-level perceptions of organizational practices.""This article discusses a theoretical framework for situating interpretations of textual data collected during research. Based on the reader response theory of Louise Rosenblatt, this framework consists of a continuum representing the range of interpretative assumptions - stances - researchers can bring to their reading of textual data. The continuum is bounded by the two most extreme stances defined by Rosenblatt as efferent, roughly comparable to the stereotypical scientific interpretative tradition, and aesthetic, roughly comparable to the stereotypical humanities interpretative tradition. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article argues that in spite of some attempts to expand the diversity of approaches in Technical Communication, the field remains rooted in an expedient, managerial, techno-rational discourse, where discourse is understood as the values that guide research, practice, and teaching. The article draws on approaches from Communication Studies, specifically discursive analysis and metaphor analysis, to ground this claim and to demonstrate what possible alternative discourses might be possible. The article then argues that moving toward an ""interpretive"" discourse will expand the values of Technical Communication, but in a way that both retains existing assumptions but also includes a new focus on the ""complete person."" Interpretive discourse is theorized using Habermas' communicative rationality and User Experience Design and the article concludes with some implications about moving Technical Communication toward discursive diversity. Ultimately, the goal of the article is to encourage researchers, teachers, and professionals to embrace this discursive diversity that complicates our historical means-ends rationality.""Carolyn Miller's ""A Humanistic Rationale for Technical Writing"" serves as an example of text that has influenced the knowledge-making activities within technical communication. The 68 references, or intertextual connections, to ""Humanistic Rationale"" between 1979 and 1995 demonstrate its influence and show the evolution of technical communication and the issues important to technical communication professionals. The authors respond to questions of the purpose of technical communication, the influence of the canons of rhetoric, the importance of audience, and the impact of social constructionism on technical communication. This analysis of the academic prose surrounding ""Humanistic Rationale"" reveals part of the discipline's discussions and the ""communal rationality"" (617) that shapes the activities of its members.""The authors review the management recruiters training program currently being used by the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation.

Successful interviewing often is, however, the technical writer's key to writing good technical prose. Whether the writer is seeking the theory behind an engineering design or preparing an annual report, the techniques that a writer uses for successful interviewing will be the same. Further, by developing good interviewing skills, a writer will improve his or her organization and writing techniques. Yet the most important aspect of good interviewing is obtaining accurate information. If technical writers want to be considered professionals in their field, they must become expert interviewers as well as good technical translators.""An expert system is an application of artificial intelligence which requires the transfer of knowledge from human to machine. The acquisition of this knowledge from experienced practitioners (domain experts) is typically inefficient. Problems associated with the subjective reporting of knowledge must be overcome. To do this, a structured rather than unstructured interviewing approach can be used by knowledge engineers. Open, closed, and probing questions as well as direction responses should be used, together with a general-to-specific technique. The goal of the knowledge acquisition interview is to obtain complete, accurate, and reliable knowledge for the expert system.""At the urging of managers from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center on the night before the fatal launch of the Challenger, the managers at Thiokol reconsidered their judgment not to launch the next day. Although there were no new data, and although their engineers still objected, the Thiokol managers took off their “engineering hats” and put on their “management hats” and decided to launch anyway. The urging of Marshall management and pressure from other sources intimidated Thiokol management and at least one Marshall engineer to do what their superiors wanted them to do. Four conditions created the intimidation: (a) a fear of retaliation, (b) a lack of justice, (c) Marshall's tradition of discouraging the reporting of bad news, and (d) an objectionable act, that is, overruling the engineers on a life or death technical decision. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Its 18 chapters cover nearly all the major technological subjects of its time, such as growing grains, weaving clothes, making sugar and salt, and building ships. The book accommodates various audiences' information needs by combining equipment and material descriptions, process explanations, and task instructions. To help audiences understand his descriptions and to follow his instructions more effectively, the author integrates 100 full-page detailed drawings. Another mechanism that the author uses to help his audiences complete the described tasks is using names (nouns) instead of action-oriented phrases for most of the chapter titles. Song's book embodies several important features in modern technical communication, especially in China's modern technical communication. The book should help international technical communicators understand China's modern technical communication from the perspectives of audience's awareness, organization of information, and use of visuals.""A significant problem for practitioners of technical communication is to gain the skills to compete in a global, multicultural work environment. Instructors of technical communication can provide future practitioners with the tools to compete and excel in this global environment by introducing heuristics of cultural dimensions into the service-level classroom. By practicing how to use these heuristics in ""real-world"" contexts, instructors can prepare students to function as both information architects and symbolic-analytic operators within this global work environment. In this article, I first examine common cultural heuristics as they pertain to business communication. Next, I articulate how technical communicators can benefit from incorporating these heuristics into the classroom. Finally, I offer a pedagogical approach to introducing heuristics of cultural dimensions into the service-level technical communication classroom.""In response to current federal mandates requiring selected businesses and government agencies to use plain language (PL) when reporting information to the public, this article advocates the introduction of PL principles into current business communication curricula. Despite recent PL mandates and advances, many current business textbooks and curricula omit PL principles. Students must become familiar with PL principles in their business communication courses in order to apply PL effectively in the workplace. To accomplish this goal, the author focuses on defining PL, outlining the history and recent developments of PL, and listing the resources and exercises instructors can use to incorporate PL principles into business communication courses. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""While business writing textbooks generally do an adequatejob of helping instructors introduce real-life challenges into the classroom, there are at least two that they tend to slight or overlook. One is an encounter with a hostile, closed-minded audience, and the other is an extended conflict.

These restrictions also affect the reading and understanding of technical documentation. In a three-phase program, we investigated the documentation-related problems of seniors and developed solutions. Phase I: We read and discussed a chapter of a handbook for a mobile phone with older adults to find out where the problems were. Phase II: We reformulated and redesigned that chapter with another group of seniors. Phase III: We tested the final version against the original with yet another set of our target population. Briefly, the three phases of the test revealed that on the somatic level, seniors need an appropriate font size. On the cognitive level, they need clearly structured information and less computer terminology. Most likely all audiences would benefit from these changes.""Holography is a three-dimensional imaging technique which has been successfully applied as a research tool, an artistic medium, and a means of communication. Because of its innate visual appeal, the hologram shows great promise as a graphic medium in printed material and as a visual aid. This article briefly describes what holograms are and how they are made, and discusses the numerous ways this imaging technique is being applied. Most holograms are made with a single laser and have a monochromatic image. Color holographic images have been produced, however, with the use of multiple laser sources of the primary colors. Although the most striking imaging properties of the hologram have been illustrated by recording three-dimensional objects, it is also possible to achieve some rather interesting effects by holographing two-dimensional film transparencies. For example, the individual frames of a motion picture film can be holographed sequentially on film to produce a stereoscopic moving holographic image.""Interactive videodisc systems consist of videodisc players, television monitors, and computers. With this communication medium, you can show users information they might not otherwise see and let users go through information on their own rate. Users learn better from interactive videodisc because the medium communicates through several senses. Effective videodisc presentations interact frequently with users and can be viewed in either computer displays or video.""This article presents a brief introduction to the Copyright Law (PL 94-553) that includes the background to and history of the legislation, a precis of significant changes, a glossary of terms as defined in copyright law and a table of contents to the legislation accumulated from official but uncopyrighted sources.""This special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication focuses on developing new case studies for use in technical and professional communication courses. The term ""case study"" used here refers to descriptions of real world events that illustrate particular communication problems through collections of primary documents and secondary materials. While case study pedagogy provides students with many benefits, such as concrete applications of technical communication theory, there are distinct challenges that may prevent instructors from developing case studies, such as collecting primary documents as they become available in the media The case studies treated in the special issue focus on the following events: the crash of Air Midwest Flight 5481, the accounting scandals of the Enron corporation, the communication crisis at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the leaking of nuclear material at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant, the Texas A&M bonfire collapse, and airline press releases in the wake of the attack on the World Trade Center. © 2004 IEEE.""Discusses the benefits of qualitative research and shows how it can reveal the impact and value of the technical communication profession  Shows how the articles in this issue provide insights into the challenges, opportunities, and innovations that characterize contemporary technical communication practice.""Corporations are changing; they are reinventing, rethinking, transforming, and reengineering themselves. And with change comes chaos, uncertainty, and renewal. For everyone involved, change represents either a threat to security or an opportunity to move forward. What are the forces at work in changing corporations? In the author's own research on corporate culture and on the forces affecting corporate communication, marketing, and advertising, five general categories of forces have emerged: a new sophistication in customers or audience; new media and technologies or communication tools; a more complex ethical environment; stronger economic factors; and new strategic alliances.""There is a rising interest within the world community in what is occurring in professional communication in Russia, and in the social and market opportunities that will appear there in the future. We live in a world in which the pace of change is more rapid than at any time in our history. The most important aspect of this change is the fact that we are making a transition to a democratic society at the same time as we are in the process of establishing the principles of a market economy. Russia is a country with enormous reserves of raw materials, vast territories, and rich intellectual resources. And now, as Russia is experiencing a painful transition to a market economy, the nation's economic potential becomes more and more dependent on the sophistication of its infrastructure. That is the reason why the information technologies and professional communication have become key factors of social progress. The Russian centers of research and industry are widely dispersed geographically, in such cities as Vladivostok, Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Ekaterinburg, Saint Petersburg and Moscow. The last three or four years have seen a sharp increase in the demands for business information, electronic mail and communications for far-flung business and financial operations.""Word processing provides a mechanism to prepare material that would otherwise by typewritten. The preparation is simpler and quicker, and the output is neat, clean, and usually mistake-free. The biggest advantage of word processing is the ability to make changes with great ease and to enter the changes before the copy is actually printed. Word processing allows titles and other material to be centered by a simple directive from the user, instead of by tedious character counting. Similarly, word processors allow easy indentation and justification, printing the document when directed with two even vertical margins instead of just one. Some word processors also title and paginate every page. The most important aspect of word processing is that information entered on the keyboard need not be printed immediately. Instead it is saved and can be further processed before the printing is actually done. The article continues with an elementary explanation of the hardware components of a word-processing system and how to use them."Technical communication research has suffered from the lack of a widely accepted framework for establishing a body of knowledge drawn from research. This Introduction suggests that the methods of social science research - specifically the research methods used in communication science - offer a solid methodological foundation that future researchers may employ to advance the field of professional technical communication."To improve the structure of complex information when it is to be presented electronically, technical communicators may turn to ideas taken from object-oriented programming to clarify and revive the structure of the material in existing documents before mounting them on-line. When an organization starts moving information onto the Web, technical communicators may go through a phase transition: as the publishing system becomes much more complex, it exhibits emergent behaviors, and it demands new attitudes, concepts, and work from the technical communicator.""With the widespread popularity of distance learning, there is a need to investigate elements of online courses that continue to pose significant challenges for educators. One of the challenges relates to creating and managing group projects. This study investigated business students’ perceptions of group work in online classes. The constructs of learning and social interaction, process satisfaction, product satisfaction, and use of technology in the virtual learning environment were investigated. The use of social media networks by group participants was also examined. Recommendations are provided for business educators looking to develop or enhance teamwork in virtual learning environments. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article examines structural and format changes in annual reports of U.K. listed companies from 1965 to 2004 with a particular focus on graph use. The article compares a new sample of 2004 annual reports with preexisting samples by Lee and by Beattie and Jones. Lee's identified trends continue. There has been a sharp increase in page length, voluntary information, and narrative information, particularly among large listed companies. A detailed analysis of voluntary disclosure indicates changes in the incidence and pattern of generic sections. Graph usage is now universal. However, key financial graph use has slightly declined, replaced by graphs depicting other operating issues. Impression management through selectivity, graphical measurement distortion, and manipulation of the length of time series graphed are common. Overall, annual reports continue to exhibit many features of public relations documents rather than financially driven, statutory documents, and the analysis of graph usage suggests a need for policy guidelines to protect users. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""The faxes sent and received during one week by a small Finnish company involved in international operations were analyzed to determine whether or not the business fax contains distinct features that warrant classifying it as a genre. Using a framework of critical discourse analysis, the study looked at a total of 69 faxes. The results suggest that the business fax is a distinct, dynamic genre that is constituted by and constitutive of the social practices within which it is situated. Five specific subgenres of the business fax - identified as specific information, specific requests, ""for your information,"" first contact, and order - were also found. Some implications of English being used as the common language for faxes are also considered. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""This two-part study with working adults examines which communication behaviors occur at work and how these communication behaviors are evaluated. Through an analysis of organizational communication publications (articles, organizational case studies, textbooks), the authors identified 343 communication behaviors; sorting analysis reduced this list to 163 verbal communication behaviors used in the workplace. In Study 1, using an online survey, 126 working adults identified which of these communication behaviors had been heard or observed the previous day in the workplace. Forty-four communication behaviors were identified by 50% or more of the participants, indicating their frequent use in the workplace. In Study 2, 331 working adults evaluated their effectiveness on the 44 verbal communication behaviors. Factor analysis reduced that list to 36 verbal workplace communication behaviors composed of four factors: information sharing, relational maintenance, expressing negative emotion, and organizing communication behaviors. The Workplace Communication Behavior Inventory is presented. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Current approaches to employment interviewing have yet to achieve their full potential in matching people with jobs and promoting positive, long-term employer/employee relations. Although untrained and trained interviewers have sought to discover the true personalities, motives, and values of applicants, some interviewing methods used in pursuit of this goal may invite applicant performances of limited relevance and uncertain meaning. Interviewers can dramatically improve the value of the interview by helping interviewees give their best performances of job-relevant interpersonal and technical skills, practicing conscious transparency, and making the interview a mutually controlled dialogue more typical of those on the job. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""Integrating and using technology in the technical communication classroom is an ongoing interest and challenge for the field. Previous work tends to focus on best practices and other types of generalized advice, all of which are invaluable to teachers. But this article encourages teachers to also pay attention to sociotechnical forces and dynamics in local settings. It explains how a cartography of affect can be useful in demonstrating how technologies become imbued with meaning and significance in particular pedagog-ical contexts. The authors illustrate the value of this mapping practice through a case study of iPad integration and use in a technical communication service course and its teacher-training course. They also provide examples of heuristic questions that can guide critical cartography projects in local settings. © The Author(s) 2013.""The author of this article ques tions many of the accepted “principles” derived from ex perimental studies in the field of communications research.

Our research site was a multinational financial services call center that we came to know through grounded study techniques, including analyses of 289 stressful calls. Examining calls as communication genre revealed that agents and customers have conflicting organizational, service, and efficiency needs that undermine communication. But three types of empathic expression can mitigate these conflicts in some interactions. Affective expressions, such as ""I'm sorry,"" were less effectual, but attentive and cognitive responses could engender highly positive responses although customers' need for them varied tremendously. Thus, customer service agents must use both diagnostic and enactment skills to perform empathic communication effectively, a coupling that we call empathywork. © The Author(s) 2012.""Gamification is a concept that originates from the digital media domain. It includes a process of enhancing a service using game design elements in nongame contexts. Although much research exists on gamification, very few studies focus on the application of gamification in the enterprise. Research questions: (1) How do managers currently use and experience gamification as a communication medium? (2) Why is it that few instances of gamification exist in enterprise management? (3) Is gamification's own branding somehow cannibalizing itself in enterprise applications? Literature review: We reviewed gamification literature in the workplace and looked at the applicability of game design elements within the enterprise culture. Enterprise gamification is still considered uncharted territory, and more research on gamification in the enterprise is needed. But existing research studies support our claims that there is high potential for enterprise gamification that needs to be explored. Methodology: Observations were made during fieldwork with an exploratory interview research approach. These observations were put to test via an online psychological single-blind controlled quantitative experiment conducted with 198 survey respondents to investigate the effect of branding on gamification and its perception in the enterprise context. Results and conclusions: The results show that using the ""gamification"" brand clearly drives lower rates of perceived acceptance of the concept, whereas using an ""unbranded"" version of the same gamification concepts results in comparatively higher rates of perceived acceptance and a general willingness to adopt within the enterprise context. The results also confirm that ""interest"" and ""branding"" are interrelated, and that gamification faces higher rates of resistance, lower rates of adoption, and lower success rates in the enterprise compared to other fields. Thus, enterprise gamification may not be correctly branded, and our research recommends the use of a set of procedural, prepackaged best practices, in the form of an implementation framework, to guarantee optimal design and implementation. © 2017 IEEE.""This article explores the purposes, character, and efficacy of ""about us"" information that technical communication contractors, consultants, and companies post on their business Web sites. Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 independent technical communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services, and interviewed a subset of survey respondents. Results: Overall, participants perceived their Web site's information about both their business and themselves to be somewhat useful in marketing their services, though they were also divided about which of these two types was the more useful. Regardless of whether their business comprised just themselves or a larger corporation with associates, some participants foregrounded their business's identity to build credibility whereas others foregrounded their own and their associates' personal identities to build rapport. Conclusion: ""About us"" information about a business and about its people can be usefully conceived as two distinct types of information, each deployed selectively to serve distinct purposes. Among the factors that may influence whether and how a technical communication business would foreground a corporate face or a personal face are not necessarily its corresponding corporate or personal status but instead the business's industry, its location internationally, its size, and the qualifications and gender of its people.""We propose a conceptual as well as practical distinction, possible in voice mail systems, between the traditional telephone genre of voice answering and a new genre of telephone communication of voice messaging. This distinction should be reflected in comments provided by respondents who report that they use voice mail more for messaging than for answering, and by those who send more voice messages than do others. Semantic network analysis identified different clusters of concepts found in responses to open-ended questions on a survey completed by these kinds of users. For example, all users had common word clusters concerning the ability to overcome temporal constraints and leave messages through voice mail. However, responses of “senders” and “messagers” included word clusters such as “group distribution” and greater concern with issues such as critical mass and problems of traditional telephone usage (such as busy signals), while responses of low senders and answerers included clusters indicating concern about the impersonal nature of voice mail. We discuss implications both for this method of analysis as well as for implementation and management of voice mail systems. © 1993, Sage Publications.

For this purpose, worked examples from systems engineering and technical writing are considered. It is shown that a correctly done technical writing can meet the strict definition of an engineering discipline.""In a national survey, 500 technical communicators and 500 technical communication teachers were asked to assess the ethics of seven document design cases. According to the 455 respondents, manipulating typography and leading to fit more or less information on a page and using persuasive coloring or spacing are ethical practices, while the manipulation of pictorial illustrations and the distortion of graphics are unethical. Opinion on using typography to decrease readability is divided. In five of the seven cases, women are consistently more lenient or men consistently more strict in their evaluations of ethics. Respondents offered nine different types of explanations for their answers: common practices, specifications, reader's responsibility, writer's responsibility, writer's intentions, consequences, judgments, principles, and insufficient information. The explanation most often given was consequences, indicating a ""goal-based"" philosophy of ethics.""Unjustified type carries an unjustified reputation with some people: it is seen as nothing better than mere typewritten copy; really professional work should be ″blocked out″ , justified. The author argues that such a view is the product of closed minds, and shows that there are significant advantages to leaving the right edge ragged. Examples are given of the same paragraph: (1) set in traditional justified (blocked-out) style; (2) set to the same column width, but unjustified and without end-of-line hyphens, resulting in one additional line of type; (3) set in a column one-half -pica wider, set ″tight-ragged″ , with hyphenation reduced but not completely eliminated, with word spacing that is even; the number of lines is the same as the original justified version. Examples (1) through (3) are set ″flush left″ , as is normally the case. Example (4) is set ″flush right, ragged left″ , the reverse of (2); reduced legibility results because a vertical reference line on the left is missing, requiring the eye to search for the beginning of each new line. Example (5) is set ″ragged right and left″ (centered); again legibility is reduced because the vertical reference line on the left is missing. The author recommends the setting of Example (3) for legibility and economy in number of lines.

Examples are given of how recent computer technology has been applied to keep ISI services cost-effective as well as to improve their quality.""This paper surveys studies of the process model for understanding writing, focusing in particular on problem-solving strategies in the writing process. It then presents a case study of the use of issue trees—a hierarchal network of goals not unlike the decision trees used in management science and artificial intelligence—to guide the writing process of the second author as he wrote a technical report. A good issue tree shows the relationships between various pieces of information: Which information is central and which is supportive or incidental. Issue trees ofter engineers a visual view of their writing plan. By building a hierarchal issue tree to illustrate the logical links of the proposed writing task, the engineer can put an overlay of “technology” on the task of writing-an overlay that may “trick” the unwilling writer into writing, and writing well. © 1994 IEEE.""This study explores the use of issues advertising as a form of organizational crisis communication. Specifically, the study analyzes Northwest Airline's (NWA) use of image restoration strategies in the issues advertisements it placed related to the 1998 pilots' strike. We conclude that issues advertising enabled NWA to be proactive in their attempt to reduce culpability for the strike. The evidence also suggests that NWA was able to retain passenger volume but failed to maintain investor confidence. NWA's persuasiveness was limited by the decision to offer only pseudo-corrective action, an inappropriate attempt at separation from its pilots and a failure to account for the relationship history with employees. The study concludes that issues advertising campaigns can incorporate image restoration strategies, serve as part of an organization's crisis management plan, and provide essential information to internal and external stakeholders. © 2002, Sage Publications.

The survey is mostly from the perspective of a designer or project planner concerned with issues in both software development and document development.""This article explores three ways to design US empirical methods to be more valid and ethical in cross-cultural studies. First, intercultural researchers need to distinguish broad rhetorical and cultural patterns from regional, organizational, and personal patterns, a process that requires balancing the fact of difference with the need for generalization. Second, US researchers need to distinguish not only the differences in rhetorical patterns in a form of communication but also in the ways that form is used rhetorically. Third, researchers need to construct researcher-participant relationships that are sensitive to the values of organizational relationships in both cultures.""When speakers must convey precise technical material or keep within a specified time limit, they may need to read their speeches. Unfortunately, those who read speeches often read them badly. Oral presenters can, however, read their speeches effectively by following a few simple steps in writing the material and preparing the manuscript and by observing some principles of good oral delivery. This paper offers practical suggestions to those who want to read their speeches and, except for typesize and spacing, provides an example of a speech written for reading aloud.""Much of America was stunned into mourning on February 1, 2003 as the space shuttle Columbia was reported to have broken up over Texas. The ensuing investigation revealed that debris at liftoff was the cause of the crash, but the official report suggested that NASA's organizational communication was just as much to blame. This article uses transactive memory theory to argue that there were significant gaps in the knowledge network of NASA organizational members, and those gaps impeded information flow regarding potential disaster. E-mails to and from NASA employees were examined (the ""To"" and ""From"" fields) to map a network of communication related to Columbia's damage and risk. Although NASA personnel were connected with each other in this incident-based network, the right information did not get to the people who needed it. The article concludes with extensions of theory and practical implications for organizations, including NASA.""This article investigates whether CEOs actually demonstrate the communication strengths and weaknesses they think they have. Videotaped interviews with CEOs in the initial stage of executive coaching were analyzed to identify categories of communication strength and weakness: delivery, content, audience, and character. Next, the interviews and transcriptions were coded to track use of rhetorical formats, delivery stress, disfluencies, and timing. Speakers who identified themselves as having both delivery and content strengths or weaknesses differed significantly from the other CEOs. This has important implications for the study of impromptu communication, executive coaching, and business communication. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""The podcast is a unique configuration of IText precisely because it foregrounds sound in the current cultural moment of secondary orality. This return to an oral-aural tradition offers several unique benefits. Podcasts adapt well to today's unstructured work spaces. Moreover, podcasts blur boundaries between virtual and face-to-face communication and virtual and physical spaces. Finally, podcasts are fragmented, reflecting the fluidity of previous ITexts; yet, unlike ITexts, podcasts mostly exist as complete, scripted texts. This article raises questions concerning what the podcast contributes to overall knowledge of how texts are mediated through evolving information technologies. © The Author(s) 2011.""Most people who use information technology (IT) every day use IT in text-centered interactions. In e-mail, we compose and read texts. On the Web, we read (and often compose) texts. And when we create and refer to the appointments and notes in our personal digital assistants, we use texts. Texts are deeply embedded in cultural, cognitive, and material arrangements that go back thousands of years. Information technologies with texts at their core are, by contrast, a relatively recent development. To participate with other information researchers in shaping the evolution of these ITexts, researchers and scholars must build on a knowledge base and articulate issues, a task undertaken in this article. The authors begin by reviewing the existing foundations for a research program in IText and then scope out issues for research over the next five to seven years. They direct particular attention to the evolving character of ITexts and to their impact on society. By undertaking this research, the authors urge the continuing evolution of technologies of text."Issues surrounding the ethics and social responsibility of public relations are addressed here through a discussion of J. Grunig's distinction between asymmetrical and symmetrical organizational communication. His development of a research tradition for public relations is examined with particular attention given to conceptualizing organizations as political systems and exploring the contrasting presuppositions of asymmetrical and symmetrical models of communication. Symmetrical presuppositions are presented as an ethical and effective framework for public relations theory. © 1989 IEEE"It is not too much to say that English dominates the global business world as a lingua franca. No one could deny or disagree with the statement of Michael Skapinker in the Financial Times: ""Never in recorded history has a language been as widely spoken as English is today. The reason why millions are learning it is simple: It is the language of international business and therefore the key to prosperity. It is not just that Microsoft, Google, and Vodafone conduct their business in English; it is the language in which Chinese speak to Brazilians and Germans to Indonesians."" Against the backdrop of a widespread use of English, international managers seem to believe that ""English ability equals global business communication ability""-as if greater fluency in the English language automatically leads to enhanced abilities in global communication. Even though Business English as a Lingua Franca dominates international business, I believe that English ability alone cannot be considered equivalent to global communication ability. What is also essential to effective communication is consideration for others and understanding of different perspectives.

Maintaining that a direct, surface-level comparison can be misleading, the authors first review the characteristics of the Japanese language, the traditional format and style of Japanese letters, and the status of letter writing in Japanese business circles. Then they discuss, with some examples, typical Japanese ways of thinking and feeling behind the letters they write, whether in Japanese or in English. This may serve as a hint for cross-cultural understanding, especially about the often ambiguous communications of the Japanese. © 1982, Sage Publications.

The study presented here examines the effect of inductive versus deductive organizational patterns on Japanese readers so as to identify what pattern may best suit them. The study assessed Japanese readers' comprehension of and preference for expository text that contains a thesis and is organized either inductively or deductively. The results reveal that readers recall more information from inductively organized text. Preference results were less clear. The implications for native English speaking document designers are discussed at length.""A job seeker who tailors each resume and application letter to capture the interest of a particular employer is far more likely to elicit a response than a job seeker who simply sends copies of a standard resume and letter to every employer. In a highly competitive job market, careful orchestration of the whole employment-seeking process is essential, from resume preparation to personal presentation during an interview. This article examines the major factors one has to consider today when applying for a job. It emphasizes the written aspects, since applicants initially are judged almost entirely on the written documentation they provide. It also includes comments on presenting a confident, informative image during a job interview.""The four steps of job instruction training are prepare, present, try out, and follow up. Preparation by the supervisor or instructor is for motivation of the employee or trainee. This involes empathy, assurance that nothing will be expected that can't be learned with reasonable effort, and encouragement of questions. Presentation on how a task is accomplished includes telling, showing, demonstrating, and explaining the sequence and steps so the trainee understands the job. Trying out provide learning by doing with reinforcement or correction by immediate and precise feedback. Following up gets the trainee flying solo through frequent examination of progress at first, gradually tapering off. An important aspect of job training is to convey a sincere desire not to judge but to help the trainee succeed.""Factual information about the communication activity of employees in various job levels in a firm can provide a partial data base for decisions about employee selection, promotion, and participation in educational programs. This paper discusses the communication activities of technical/engineering employees in eight different job levels in an architect/engineering firm.""The affective responses of readers to job-refusal letters using direct and indirect approaches were investigated. Subjects were requested to rate organizational plan on 19 dependent measures. Results indicated that the direct job-refusal letter was preferred. It was viewed as more efficient, valuable and straightforward than the indirect approach. These findings are in conflict with current literature favoring the indirect approach for conveying negative information. © 1996 By the Association for Business Communication.""During the 1980s, studies about stress in academia and business indicated that jobrelated stress is a serious problem. The purpose of this exploratory, correlational study was to examine the nature and extent of job-related stress among collegiate business-and professional-writing faculty members in the United States. The stress scale developed by the author was consistent with the framework on stress and burnout suggested by Pines and Aronson. Results indicate that job-related stress is associated with faculty members’ rank, type of institution, and sex. Job-related stress tends to increase with greater expectations of publication and service, the total number of courses taught, and the number of writing courses taught. Job-related stress tends to decrease with increased maturity—age, years of teaching, years postdegree, and years teaching business and professional writing. Analysis of two open-ended questions indicates that paper grading is a significant stressor. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Although The Nurnberg Funnel is a stimulating and valuable book, Carroll fails to make a compelling case for minimalism as a broadly applicable alternative to the contemporary multi-component documentation set. © 1990 IEEE""With the rise of science, 18th-century logic and rhetoric began to make use of inductive patterns of discourse. In logic, William Duncan discussed two methods of organizing extended discourse, the methods of analysis and synthesis. Analysis represents the movement of thought as the thinker or writer works through a problem to discover its solution. This method is actually an early form of what is now known as problem solving that Joseph Priestley, a rhetorician as well as a scientist, introduced into rhetoric. He uses analysis in his scientific writing, especially in his Experiments on Different Kinds of Air, in the form of a five-stage mental operation or heuristic that records the progress of his thoughts as he experimented on air to isolate and identify oxygen.""In 1929 there was almost no scientific periodical publishing in Canada. The National Research Council of Canada, in response to the scientific community, undertook to publish the Canadian Journal of Research. In 1935 this became two publications, each with two sections. In 1944 six separate sectional publications were in being, and in 1950 these became six individual journals. Since then five new journals have been added to meet Canadian needs.""U. S. publishers of 2500 scholarly and research journals were surveyed on behalf of the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works by the Indiana University Graduate Library School. Questionnaires elicited information on attitudes toward photocopying and various methods for accomplishing photocopying not exempted by the Copyright Law of 1976 from copyright-owner authorization. The response rate was approximately 38 percent of the 2552 journals surveyed; 89 percent of those responding were copyrighted journals, whereas Copyright Office records indicate that only 60 percent of the nonresponding journals are being registered for copyright. Results are discussed as a function of journal and publisher characteristics.""The quality of philosophy journals varies widely; hence, a basic problem is quality control. The minimum standards instituted by the Association of Philosophy Journal Editors to protect authors from unjust treatment by editors are presented. The lack of existing standards concerning the use of referees, blind refereeing, and sharing referees' comments with authors is also treated. The efforts of some journals to provide their referees with written statements of the standards that an article must meet to be published are viewed as encouraging. Although the general lack of standards is certainly a problem, the organizational controls required to establish and enforce uniform standards across a discipline might limit creativity and individual freedom to the point of being morally unacceptable.""Key aspects of the Copyright Law of 1976 of particular interest to journal authors, publishers, and users are briefly outlined and commented upon: initial ownership of copyright; subject matter of copyright; journals and contributions; works of the U.

These journals, focusing on the interpersonal relationships within each group and the team interaction itself, facilitate team efficiency, foster the growth of individual communication skills, and permit the instructor to monitor the groups' progress. The journals also provide technical students with an opportunity to use nontransactional writing in a meaningful way. This article gives the rationale for using the journals, describes the assignment (including the ethics of guiding such writing), and examines journal entries to illuminate the expressive/exploratory discourse students produce. This article shows how their writing can assist their development as professional communicators while facilitating their project groups.""One of the most difficult tasks for any professional communicator is identifying and negotiating the political shoals in an organization. In his essay ""What is universal pragmatics?"" Habermas (1979) describes a broad, universal concept of pragmatics (the study of language use in a specific situation), one that is useful for analyzing how power affects organizational communication. By exploiting the sociological aspect of Habermas' universal pragmatics, communicators can use his theory to understand how power affects communication in the workplace. I briefly describe Habermas' theory, modify his theory to relate more specifically to communication in an organization, and provide a brief example illustrating the theory's usefulness.""The author suggests that the purpose of minutes is to inform those at the meeting and others, of what took place at past proceedings, and of the further action particular members agreed to take. Minutes must be in the style of a written communication and not of the spoken communication of the meeting; must be a record of facts and not a factual record; they must also be short, expressing concisely only that information which the readership requires.""The transition from typing pool to word-processing pool in a major corporate division creates a more efficient and cost-saving operation. With it, however, comes the requirement that the word-processing group leader know the capability of the equipment as well as, or even better than, the operators. Here is a list of reasons why the group leader needs a workstation to meet that requirement: Knowing system capability; Mastering terminology; Controlling and documenting procedures; Creating standard formats; Reviewing documents; Helping with math and scientific notation; Controlling work flow; Managing files; Keeping management data; Providing a backup workstation. Other advantages of the leader's having a workstation could be listed as well: Ability to answer questions of operators and authors about equipment capability; Ease of illustrating a procedure, rather than trying to explain it with words only; Ability to finalize operating procedures before publishing them in a procedure manual; Availability of a workstation for electronic mail; Instant recall of a calendar and a meeting schedule.""The Westinghouse R&D Center issues a monthly Technical Bulleting to keep the Corporation's 10,000 engineers - scattered in 80 operating divisions - aware of the work being done by the Center. The proprietary bulletin is composed of abstracts of the technical publications emanating from the Center during the past month, a brief article about some new cabability or outstanding research project of the Center, and a biographical note on one of the technical managers. A simple means is also provided for the reader to obtain a copy of any report abstracted.""One course can serve well as a whetstone to sharpen a student's communication skills which have become dulled over years of carelessness and thoughtlessness: letter writing. It teaches the student audience analysis - to understand and respect the reader's needs in every writing situation and to use the necessary tact and diplomacy in all responses. After completing such a course, the student can translate the resharpened writing skills and audience analysis to all writing requirements.""Is the current style guide helping our business? Does it give us an edge over our competitors in reaching out to people? Company executives ask these questions before allocating budgets and resources for the documentation team. A style guide is a rule-driven document that sets the parameters for consistency and acceptability of all written materials produced by an organization. But, is that the sole function of a style guide? This paper lays out key fundamentals of how to make an effective style guide and explores its benefits. The article also illustrates the process of developing a style guide in detail while satisfying the needs of the organization. Method: To understand the best practices in the industry, a comparative analysis of five style guides of global software companies was done. Further, an online survey was administered to the technical writing community to collect more information. To get first-hand feedback from professionals, seven technical writers were interviewed and discussions in online technical writing forums were facilitated. Result: In addition to generating document consistency, 82% of the survey participants concurred that an effective style guide helps in creating a distinct brand image. Word usage, new terminology, document formatting and meeting needs of global audience are important topics that need constant attention during designing a style guide. Conclusion: A style guide will have a successful impact when it is supported by management, incorporates broader inputs from all its beneficiaries, is integrated into the day-to-day operations, and is updated periodically © 2015, (publisher).All rights reserved.""The role of Business Communication in collegiate schools of business has been questioned since the reports of 1959.

The author's procedure, in the nine steps described here, provides students with an understanding of classification as an analytical and generative tool. Its usefulness in analysis is discovered through a structural study of Lewis Mumford's ″Machines, Utilities, and 'The Machine'″ ; an awareness of Mumford's classificatory structure helps students understand his essay. Students see for themselves, by organizing facts into paragraphs, the generative power of contextual editing applied to classification; the same kind of structuring Mumford uses can be used in their own writing. This generative application simulates the research-to-writing process and dramatically increases the coherence and clarity of much student writing."Provides a descriptive account of one organization's process for the continual development of its technical support knowledge base  Lists the critical skills and competencies that the organization's knowledge workers report using."Maintains that we must redefine knowledge management, our profession, and ourselves to lead knowledge management efforts  Argues that we should define ourselves not by the products we produce but by the core competencies with which we produce them.""Described is the beginning step in a systematic document development process for new drug teams as they work collaboratively to produce the necessary approval documentation.

Various data collection methods were used to examine the skills and rhetorical knowledge students learned in a technical communication course and to determine whether or not students relied on that knowledge as they completed writing assignments in an engineering course. Also examined was the effect of workplace experiences on shaping students' rhetorical knowledge. This study indicated that students did appear to transfer rhetorical strategies between different contexts, and those strategies were learned in the workplace as well as the classroom. © 2004 IEEE.""Knowledge transfer among geographically separated members is recognized as a critical ingredient for collaborative accomplishment of work in virtual teams. However, due to the ""localness"" of knowledge, such transfer of knowledge is believed to be inherently problematic; thus, it is important to develop a solid understanding of the factors that enable knowledge transfer in such contexts. Drawing on existing literature on knowledge management and virtual teamwork, we identify four Cs (communication, capability, credibility, and culture) associated with individuals who transfer significant amounts of knowledge to remote members. Next, we test the four Cs in the context of US-Norwegian virtual teams engaged in systems development. The volume of communication, the credibility of the communicator, and the nature of cultural values held (i.e., collectivism) by the communicator were found to significantly predict the extent of knowledge transferred; although, contrary to expectations, capability was not found to have a significant influence. A number of implications for virtual team participants and professional communicators are articulated. Avenues for future research are also suggested. © 2005 IEEE.""Supplying service data to foreign nationals is a problem for many multinational firms like Eastman Kodak. Faced with the constant delays and costs and errors inherent in large-scale translation efforts, the company took a new tack: it developed its own universal language for its service publications. This language is called Kodak International Service Language (KISL). KISL is a limited-use language, based on English, designed strictly to communicate service information. This restricted application makes it possible to keep KISL simple and limit the vocabulary and grammar to service matters only. Because it is used only as a written language, KISL is easy to learn: the user does not need to learn pronunciation. Not only is it easily understood by the reader, but it also provides a standardized, meaningful framework for those who write service manuals. The language employs a vocabulary of fewer than 1000 words, and there can be only one meaning for each word. Word definitions leave no freedom for colloquialisms or ambiguous meanings. Actually, the KISL vocabulary consists of two parts: a core vocabulary of about 350 words that are common to all types of Kodak equipment, and seven special lists that relate to individual machines or groups of machines. Whenever numbers are used, they are presented numerically instead of as words.""This case study examines international business letters of complaint written in English by U.S. managers whose first language (L1) is English and by Korean managers for whom English is a second language (L2). Important differences exist in rhetorical choices between the two groups. The U.S. writers used a direct organizational pattern and tended to state the main idea or problem first before sharing explanatory details that clearly related to the stated problem. By contrast, the standard Korean pattern was indirect and tended to delay the reader's discovery of the main point. The U.S. managers implied that a problem existed but requested action explicitly. The Korean managers were not uniform in their strategy for making complaints implicit and action requests explicit. These findings suggest that Li writers must be sensitive to L2 features that can present obstacles to efficient communication in international business. Someone accustomed only to the U.S. pattern might find the L2 patterns of organization and style in the Korean letters vague, emotional, and accusatory. U.S. managers who can recognize the L2 rhetorical patterns identified in this study will be more likely to accept their Korean counterparts' rhetorical choices. Equally important, Korean business people should know that these patterns in L2 letters of complaint may not be tolerated by Americans who lack this understanding. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""To communicate ecological information for watershed management, an inter-disciplinary program in northern Michigan used a variety of mutually reinforcing techniques including a series of Lakeland Reports - short, self-contained brochures with a blend of hard information (factual data) and soft (general principles); local data, illustrations, action implications, and quizzes were used to stimulate involvement. A survey of recipients found that the series had captured reader interest; a large majority judged it useful to themselves and even more rated it useful to public officials. Many of the reports could be adapted for environmental communication in other inland lake regions by retaining soft information and substituting local illustration and hard data.""Standard approaches to ethics in business writing courses do not adequately stress the inescapable power of language to perpetrate certain values.

Findings showed that the usage errors least distracting to both audiences were lexical elements such as use of “disinterested” for “uninterested,” the verb “prioritize,” and “data” as a singular, as well as the use of an adverbial phrase to complete a linking verb. The most distracting errors were primarily sentence-structure errors such as run ons, fragments, danglers, and faulty parallel structure. The findings are useful in two ways: They describe the reactions of educated users to language elements that may be in process of change; and they offer instructors more in formation to use as a basis for emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain usage elements in an already crowded communication course. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Although this would seem to facilitate communication, this article argues that the choice of language(s) used is a delicate issue, highlighting the complexities of any split into native/nonnative speakers, and thus requiring considerable people management skills. This article discusses research from the Helsinki School of Economics on language and communication in multinational corporations based in non-English speaking countries. It suggests a reconceptualization of English lingua franca as business English lingua franca (BELF), and argues that BELF is a mostly oral language through which power is wielded in multinationals, and perceptions of self and others created. Moreover, it is not a cultureless language, but rather creates new operational cultures. Language choice thus has implications for management, HR, and employee satisfaction. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""Many writers in the robotics field personify robots. By ″humanizing″ these computer-controlled machines, they attempt to make a difficult and potent technology understandable to potential users in labor and management. However, the comparison of robots to humans has often made the technology fearful to would-be users. By judiciously using personification and by becoming aware of the awesome power of language, robotics experts can disseminate their research more effectively to nontechnical audiences.""This historical case study identifies language components managers may use to articulate shifts in their strategy. The authors analyzed the language revisions and substitutions Dana Corporation's upper management made to their highly significant strategic statement, The Philosophy and Policies of Dana (PPD). A large global vehicle parts supplier, Dana experienced tremendous growth and standing until the late 1990s, when a downturn in the industry necessitated dramatic facility closings and workforce reductions. The authors compared the 1987 and 2004 versions of management's PPD using two frameworks from strategy to guide textual analyses: Campbell's Ashridge Mission Model and Eccles and Nohria's Strategic Triadic, coupled with historical company research and conversations with company officials. Dana's example suggests language options-thematic devices, modifiers, verbs, and sentence subjects-that managers should consider when formulating messages about the strategic changes they envision. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article focuses on the degree of alignment among multinational company (MNC) strategic orientation, human resource management (HRM) practices, and language policies. On the one hand, the authors propose that the coherent, tight alignment among the HRM practices, language policies, and MNC strategic orientation, in terms of ethnocentricity, polycentricity, or geocentricity, is beneficial. On the other hand, they use international business research on language in MNCs to illustrate that what is good in theory is often more difficult in practice. For example, HRM practices and language policies in foreign subsidiaries may not be tightly aligned with the corporate-level activities, and some hybridization tends to occur, for example, because of contextual reasons in host countries. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Web Localization means the process of making all kinds of information on a Web site culturally, linguistically, graphically, and technologically customized to the needs of the users of the target country. Web site localization is an important means by which an industry or organization wins an international market for its products or services since the Internet has billions of users and has the world wide access. However, language problems are still an obstacle to successful Web localization or online writings for cross-cultural audiences, which result in failing to achieve the communication purpose of the organization or company that has the problems on its Web site. This article mainly focuses on the language problems in online writing or localizing a Web linguistically for cross-cultural audiences from semantic, syntactical, textual, and rhetorical perspectives and makes some suggestions for solving the problems.""Horizontal communication between subsidiaries of the same multinational corpo ration (MNC) is a Problem faced by staff as the demands for communicating across borders are pushed downwards in the organizational hierarchy. Although the choice of English as the common corporate language alleviates some of the hor izontal communication problems, it does not solve them all-particularly not when many subsidiaries are located in non-English speaking countries. In that situation, horizontal communication between subsidiaries can be a significant casualty. In a study of communication within a Finland-based MNC, Kone Elevators, interviews with staff globally revealed problems not only for non-native speakers, but also for native speakers of English. Illustrative interview data suggests that cor porate training schemes should focus on the broad spectrum of international com munication rather than on increasing a systematic knowledge of any one language. © 2002, Sage Publications.

Boards may consist of members from diverse backgrounds whose only common tie is board membership, making them particularly susceptible to misunderstandings and miscommunication. This project examines a school board's discussion of a communication policy as a way of understanding the communication problems that the board had recently experienced. A relationally responsive social constructionist perspective is applied to analyze board members' talk during a meeting and how meanings of communication and the communication problem are discursively negotiated in the interactions of board members. The analysis describes differing contexts of accountability to which board members orient in their organizational communication practices; these contexts consist of the organizational and the political. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper presents a model of language-based communication zones in international business communication. The model builds on Du-Babcock and Babcock's (1996) descriptions of expatriate-local personnel communication patterns by reconfiguring and adding new zones, which vary according to the language proficiency matches of the interactants. The eight new communication zones represented here can contribute to a more comprehensive framework that represents the dynamic, bi-directional, multiply influenced, and transformational translation process integral to international business communication. Previous research has operated on the assumption that all participants within an international business communication setting function as fully proficient users of all languages being spoken, with no accounting for communication difficulties based on varying levels of language proficiency. This study asserts that there is, in fact, a language-competency variable that greatly impacts communication and communication dynamics within the eight identified language-based communication zones. Research-based incidents from four countries illustrate likely communication patterns in the language-based communication zones. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""The author talks about the need for increased credibility for the ""Journal of Business Communication.""

Reading researchers use such formulas to equalize the reading difficulty of texts used in experiments. Results of an informal Internet survey indicate that some professional writers and editors use readability formulas that are integrated into word-processing software. This article proposes that readability formulas fail to predict text difficulty. The results of an experiment demonstrate that ""text difficulty"" is a perception of the reader and therefore cannot be objectively calculated by counting syllables, word length, sentence length, and other text characteristics. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Lawyers are expected to communicate in their own special jargon, legalese, for three reasons: (1) They don’t realize that many terms are nothing more than useless legal jargon, or (2) they enjoy a special comaraderie because only they can interpret legalese, or (3) they create a constant need for their own services by making it impossible for a layperson to handle even the simplest legal matter.

In this study, self and other assessments of leader performance were compared. Data were collected for 32 organizational teams and analyzed by means of t-tests and qualitative methods. Results indicate that self-assessments of leader performance were more favorable than were assessments by team members for 12 of 13 measured dimensions of leader behavior. Leaders and members agreed, for the most part, on leader strengths and weaknesses; there was less agreement, however, on the effect of specific leader behaviors on team performance. Implications for leadership assessment and development are discussed. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Findings indicate that the quality of LMX strongly influences subordinates' communication satisfaction in interpersonal (personal feedback and supervisory communication), group (co-worker communication and organizational integration in the workgroup), and organizational contexts (corporate communication, communication climate, and organizational media quality). Further, subordinates' LMXs with their superiors are tightly coupled with larger group and organizational contexts with respect to communication satisfaction. However, the strength of coupling decreases as the “sphere of influence” becomes more distanced and less direct. © 2002, Sage Publications.

Recent Research calls for leaders to develop higher quality relations with their members, which in turn will increase communication satisfaction. Scholars have also suggested additional research that focuses on interaction between leaders and members to better understand how leaders can and should manage such relationships. However, there is considerable evidence that leaders and members do not agree about the qualify of their relationship. In this article, we address how leaders can build better relations with their members. Specifically, we explain how leaders might improve the qualify of their relationship with members by focusing on interpersonal communication strategy. First, we focus on a competing values framework to clearly establish the importance of relationship building in effective management. Second, we define communication strategies for building better leader-member relationships by borrowing concepts from rapport management in sociolinguistics. Finally, we demonstrate how our model of leadership communication (based on a synthesis of competing values and rapport management theory) explains the quality of leader-member exchanges. © 2003 by the Association for Business Communication.""In summary, leadership communication has been a course which has been well received at Western Michigan University. Students have been very responsive to the design and content of the course. Both the theoretical and pragmatic value of the information is recognized.

Seen through the dual lens of systemic functional linguistics and critical discourse analysis, these events provide a perspective on the role of discourse in institutional settings. The events particularly illustrate the ways in which a leader's discursive choices demonstrate conflicts between management styles: the command-and-control style of the old capitalism and that of the new capitalism, which defines the leader as a coach, mentor, facilitator, and motivator rather than as a commander. Unpacking leadership discourse can shed some light on how concealed messages contribute to the success or failure of discursive events, specifically at a time of organizational transformation when such discursive events are particularly important.""Global virtual teams provide numerous benefits for corporations employing virtual organizational forms and for individual teams and team members. However, virtual collaboration also presents some well-recognized challenges. A growing body of research has examined the process of virtual teaming and the challenges inherent in that process.

Working in multicultural work groups is a new workplace reality that has created a greater need to understand how to lead these groups to maximize the quality and effectiveness of multicultural group work. Cultural differences exist regarding the importance and value of leadership. Still, much remains to be understood as to the way in which culture influences leadership and organizational processes. To what extent do cultural forces influence the expectations that individuals have for leaders and their behavior, for instance? What principles of leadership and organizational processes transcend cultures? This article is primarily directed to an American audience and uses a discursive leadership approach to provide a better understanding of how different leadership styles affect group member interaction in multicultural groups involving participants from American and East Asian cultures. Our results demonstrate that differing discursive leadership styles can affect the participation and contribution of members and may affect their feelings of inclusion and satisfaction within the group. Our results also provide evidence that particular styles of and approaches to leadership may not be as successful with all cultural groups. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article argues that leadership and rhetoric are intimately connected; therefore, rhetoric should include the explicit examination of all aspects of leadership (that is, including but not limited to rhetorical criticism of the speeches and writings of leaders), both as an area of research and an area of pedagogy. This is particularly important when helping students become active members of the citizenry is seen a central goal of what teachers are doing in the English or Communication class. The interconnections between leadership and the concept of the polis, the active assembly of citizens empowered to discuss and make public policy, is useful here, even though the polis may no longer exist in its original form. In particular, leadership through identification with the polis appears to be an approach with great potential.""This study examines the relationship between leader behaviors and engineering team performance. Data were collected for 18 engineering teams (9 research, 9 non-research) from manufacturing and aerospace organizations located in Rocky Mountain, Midwest, and East Coast regions of the United States. Results indicate that both team members and leaders believed that providing autonomy and initiating structure were important leader behaviors; however, neither of these behaviors was significantly correlated with team performance as evaluated by managers external to the team. Members also believed that leaders should exhibit personal commitment to the team goal and show consideration for team members. Specific leader behaviors were significantly correlated with team performance only for those teams with a research purpose. For such teams, public relations activities performed by leaders were important. © 1993 IEEE""The technology of movable type in early modern Europe created new communication challenges (e.g., typographical errors) for book producers. These challenges were greater with books written in learned or foreign languages or about scientific or technical subjects. Printers experimented with different strategies to ensure correctness, but the best solution came from delegating jobs to specialists. Freelance scholars were employed by authors, printers, and booksellers to correct books before publication, and some of these learned correctors were early versions of technical editors. Their history may offer insight into current communication concerns, such as the role of learned correctors in our present technological age. © 2006 Sage Publications."Concludes that technical support is an Important audience for customer documentation and a source of knowledge and Proposes that technical communicators produce documentation that meets the needs of technical support and taps into that knowledge"To prepare students for careers postgraduation, many academic programs have added components, such as service-learning projects (civic oriented, real-audience tasks) and client projects (real-audience corporate or nonprofit tasks), which aim to acclimate students to the expectations of 'real world' clients while they are still in the relatively 'safe' domain of the classroom. The two studies reported in this paper examine whether participating in client projects as part of regular technical communication classes aids students in internships and later on the job. Research questions: Overall question: How does legitimate peripheral participation in client projects give students opportunities for learning beyond the end of the client project? Literature review: Service-learning and client projects are intended to benefit students by offering real-world audiences and complex experiences with professional practitioners. Client projects help students face these challenges when moving from school to work, such as acculturating into the organization or completing tasks designed for purposes other than the learner's development. Methodology: To evaluate experiences on a particular client project, study one surveyed six students with open-ended questions about their experiences on it. To explore how the client project prepared them for internships, study two used semistructured interviews with interns and supervisors, observations of interns at work, and documents that interns created. Results and conclusions: Through recursive analysis, client projects emerged as being important in students' internship experiences. Students participate in client projects in ways that support their learning and development as members of a community of practice in internships and on the job. This learning is gradual and varied. One particular finding for teachers is that rather than shield students from client interactions, it may be helpful to promote frequent, structured interactions with clients to better prepare students for the workplace. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""To prepare students for careers postgraduation, many academic programs have added components, such as service-learning projects (civic oriented, real-audience tasks) and client projects (real-audience corporate or nonprofit tasks), which aim to acclimate students to the expectations of “real world” clients while they are still in the relatively “safe” domain of the classroom.

The operational information was presented in either text, pictures, or animation and presented either with or without spatial information (in pictures). Subjects were asked to perform thirteen tasks, using these six versions of the instructions and to do the same tasks again, using the same version of the instructions, one week later. The results show that only presenting the operational information via text is the most efficient. Subjects using instructions in animation needed significantly more time than those using the text or picture versions. Adding spatial information (in pictures) was counterproductive: without this information subjects performed better in all versions. Performing the same tasks with identical instructions one week later produced the same results, but the differences were much smaller. Therefore, it has been concluded that text remains the most efficient medium as long as users have to apply the instructions immediately. If the time needed to read/see the instructions is deducted, animation turns out to be the most efficient medium. It is therefore concluded that animation could be the best medium for learning how to operate a device.""This article encourages regional conference organizers to include businesspractices panels-in keeping with the call of theABC Committee on BusinessPractices-by describing the Business Practices Panel of the 1996 ABC Western Regional Conference.

Research questions: (1) Which rhetorical moves are found in the Summary sections of LinkedIn profiles? (2) Do the Summary sections display similar patterns of textual organization? (3) What strategies do the writers of the Summary sections deploy to achieve these rhetorical moves? Literature review: This paper has a genre analytic theoretical orientation of approach, whose underlying assumption is that genres sharing the same purposes and context of use are likely to have similar organizational patterns and to deploy similar strategies to achieve these purposes. Previous research on LinkedIn has focused on characteristics of the service and its impact on interactions, but not as a medium used in the classroom. A much deeper literature exists on job application letters, which concludes that a job application uses similar rhetorical moves, or discoursal units that perform distinct communicative functions, to a sales promotion letter. The moves include: introducing candidature, establishing credentials, essential detailing of candidature, indicating value of candidature, offering incentives, enclosing documents, using pressure tactics, soliciting response, and ending politely. Methodology: It is a study that analyzed the rhetorical structure of LinkedIn Summaries of 50 professional résumé writers in the US from a genre analytic perspective. Results and conclusions: The LinkedIn Summary shares many moves in common with the job application letter. Moves that were found in all or nearly all of the texts were establishing credentials, identifying target market and detailing service; an additional move, not seen in job application letters, was also identified - that of personal branding. However, a rigid organizational structure was not seen. The results and the methodology used to obtain them will be of use to students and others wishing to use LinkedIn to promote themselves to potential employers. The study is limited to one particular professional group in one region, but there is ample scope for further research looking at LinkedIn profiles in other professions and other parts of the world. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article examines the oral communication training that took place in Eloqi, a virtual language-learning community. Eloqi (a pseudonym) was a for-profit start-up that built and operated a proprietary Web-based, voice-enabled platform connecting English-language learners in China with trainers in the United States. While it existed, Eloqi’s unique platform was used to deliver short, one-on-one lessons designed to improve students’ oral English communication skills. Using the ethnography of communication and speech codes theory, a theoretical–methodological approach, the author presents an analysis of the speech code, or code of communicative conduct, employed at Eloqi. This code of English logic, which Eloqi’s community members associated with native English speech, comprised six locally defined rules for oral English speech; namely, speech had to be organized, succinct, spontaneously composed rather than rehearsed, original and honest, proactively improved, and positive. This article discusses the significance of this code, particularly as it pertains to cultural communication, and concludes with some implications for researchers and practitioners in business and technical communication. © The Author(s) 2016.""Investigated whether and how ""cultural standards"" influence the use of typical daily products by German and Chinese users  Used focus groups, usability tests, and a questionnaire to determine methods of obtaining product information.""Intercultural communication competence is the ability to encode and decode meanings in matches that correspond to the meanings held in the other communicator's repository. A review of intercultural training literature shows little attention has been given to how to acquire this competence for business purposes. This paper proposes a model for learning and training. The model has five levels: (a) acknowledging diversity, (b) organizing information according to stereotypes, (c) posing questions to challenge the stereotypes, (d) analyzing communication episodes, and (e) generating “other culture” messages. The key to understanding other cultures is asking questions in an ongoing challenge to previously held signs. Five categories for inquiry are (a) Thinking and Knowing, (b) Doing and Achieving, (c) the Self, (d) Social Organization, and (e) the Universe. © 1992, Sage Publications.

Where the original article dealt with how to set up and organize the collaboration, this tutorial delves into the pedagogical challenges and the process dynamics involved in such an exchange, including mediation, power, and teamwork issues. © 2010 IEEE.""New forms of computer-mediated, online learning can benefit from new forms of assessment that fit the medium and the pedagogical style of the online environment. This paper investigates students' learning styles and learning strategies in taking online collaborative exams. Applying constructivist and collaborative learning theories, the collaborative examination features students' active participation in various phases of the exam process through small group activities online. Students' learning strategies, including deep learning and collaborative learning, are investigated using a 1×3 field quasi-experiment to compare the team-based collaborative online exam with the traditional in-class exam and with the participatory exam, where students participate in the online exam processes individually. Data analysis using results from 485 students indicates that collaborative examinations significantly reduced surface learning in exam study, enhanced interactions and the sense of an online learning community, and increased perceived learning. The results also suggest learning predispositions were significantly correlated with exam study strategies, and provide indications of their effects on learning strategies. © 2008 IEEE.""This article examines communication management issues of emergency aid following natural disasters. Ten aid workers involved in the 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake relief were interviewed and surveyed while they were still ""in the field"" to determine their understanding of the role of communication in the relief effort. The analysis was framed using the three-stage process (pre-disaster, response, post-disaster). Analysis of their responses showed that there are still chronic problems in each of the stages. The importance of enhancing communication elements in the pre-disaster phase was a strong finding. In the response stage, the differential role of various media, including old technologies in poor regions, emerged as an issue. Organizational factors such as high staff turnover were also seen as negatively affecting communication efficacy. An important finding about the post-disaster stage is the importance of debriefing. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""In the fall 1982 semester, engineering report writing was integrated into the structure of a junior-level electrical engineering course at Howard University. The required homework consisted of engineering reports instead of the traditional textbook problem sets. A follow-up analysis of grades on examinations, on reports, and in later courses showed that 1) student understanding of engineering subject matter was not compromised by the course structure; 2) writing skills improved over the course of the semester; and 3) the correlation of student writing skills to problem solving skills was approximately 0. 5.""Instruction in the technical and scientific disciplines often provides students with the technical skills necessary to succeed in industry. However, these disciplines also focus on socializing students into professional identities. This study examines one exemplar discipline, mechanical engineering, to see how classroom discourse and practice construct professional identities for students (as future engineers) and their customers. Results suggest that although students' conceptions of the customer provided glimpses of professional identity, design processes in these classrooms were ultimately driven and shaped by academic communicative practices, audiences, and goals. Given this, instructional interventions are provided to integrate professionalization processes within classrooms where situated learning is apparent.""The author compares his experience learning to bunt a baseball to the teaching of business writing. The author explains that business communication students need to be led through the writing process as his coach led him through learning to bunt. Emphasizing the recursive nature of writing, the author advises that teachers show, rather than tell their students, how they go about the writing process. Several examples of how the author works with students are presented, and Peter Elbow's four-step writing approach is discussed. Discussion of process and product, feedback and practice are also provided.""Within work sites that engage in knowledge work, newcomers have particular difficulty acquiring knowledge because knowledge keeps changing. Newcomers have to assimilate currently accepted knowledge while remaining open to learning and even generating new knowledge. Such acquisition and generation of communal knowledge are examples of distributed cognition. In workplaces engaging in knowledge work (where knowledge is the primary product), distributed cognition aims at a less stable goal than the one that Hutchins describes for ship navigation. A study of six summer interns in an engineering development center shows that, for them and their more experienced colleagues, learning did not precede activity but rather was the means by which they remained attuned to activity and able to function. Cognition was distributed not only among people but also among people and their tools. Communication tools were particularly important because communication was the means by which the system functioned as a unified whole.""Teaching technical writing without formal training can be daunting. However, there are many resources available that can provide background and materials for teaching. My approach involved reading textbooks and articles not only on approaches to technical writing but also on what students can expect once they complete their education and are hired. Journals both in the field and in similar fields, working as a technical editor or writer, and attending conferences and talking with both other academics and those in the field offer help. This article, therefore, describes my approach from the day I was hired to teach two technical writing courses to my retirement 37 years later. © The Author(s) 2015.""Drawing primarily on theories of situated learning, this study compares novices learning written genres in two different institutional settings within similar disciplines: university students in public administration courses and graduate student interns placed in government agencies. Observational and textual analyses of novices learning to write the genres necessary for these settings point to differences in writing goals, guide-learner roles, text evaluations, and learning sites. The results show that when students move from the university to the workplace, they not only have to learn new genres but they need to learn new ways to learn these new genres.""This study investigated the impact of weblog use on individual learning in the context of university senior-level business education. As an emergent form of personal communication, weblogs enable people to publish their thoughts as webpages, and to share information and knowledge. Recognizing the potential impact of weblogs on knowledge expression and sharing, this research sought to empirically examine whether the continuous use of weblogs as online learning logs would affect student learning performance. The assumption was that effective use of weblogs promoted the constructivist models of learning by supporting both cognitive and social knowledge construction, and by reinforcing individual accountability in learning. Results from an Information Systems undergraduate course with 31 participants indicated that the performance of students' weblogs was a significant predictor of the learning outcome (while traditional coursework was not). Moreover, individuals' cognitive construction effort to build their own mental models and social construction effort to further enrich/expand knowledge resources appeared to be two key aspects of the constructivist learning with weblogs. Our results imply the potential benefit of using weblogs as a knowledge construction tool and a social learning medium. © 2007 IEEE.""This article reports the results of a survey of thirty-one colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States and Canada to identify common writing, speaking, and reading tasks performed by veterinary medical students and practicing veterinarians. From the twenty-seven colleges that responded (87% response rate), we learned that writing, speaking, and reading tasks are assigned in almost every veterinary medical course and that the communication tasks assigned in veterinary medical courses accord well with the communication tasks expected to be performed by practicing veterinarians. Along with these learning-to-communicate tasks, veterinary medical students are also assigned communicating-to-learn tasks. Unlike many of the writing-to-learn tasks associated with writing-across-the-curriculum programs, communicating-to-learn tasks in veterinary medical courses seem concerned with teaching students to think like veterinary medical practitioners. The emphasis on communication in veterinary medical curricula is probably due to some extent to the emphasis on problem-based learning, a curricular innovation popular in veterinary medical education. Problem-based learning requires that instruction be designed around cases or problems to be solved rather than topics or information to be covered. This merging of research and practice in the education of veterinary medical students may offer lessons for the education of professional practitioners in technical communication. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""In the increasingly competitive global economy, corporations throughout the world must take advantage of all the marketing and communication tools available to them, including blogging. Blogs allow corporations to connect with their stakeholders in a more personal way and, thus, strengthen their image, brand, and customer loyalty. Instant feedback is available through comments posted on the corporate blog, saving organizations large sums of money otherwise spent on market research. However, entering the blogosphere poses a number of risks for a corporation, such as potential damage to the corporate reputation and customer loyalty as well as legal liability. Conflicts still exist between the rights of bloggers and a corporation's interests. Blogs may be restricted by legal and ethical boundaries, which may differ across countries. This paper presents the benefits and risks associated with corporate blogging around the world and provides some interesting success stories as well as lessons learned. It also offers a compilation of guidelines for effective blogging and suggests topics for future research. © 2009 IEEE.""This article discusses the ethical and regulatory issues that technical communicators need to consider when conducting Internet research. Method: We open by considering how technical communicators live, work, and do research in global contexts where distributed networks for the design, development, and distribution of documents, interfaces, and technologies span cultural and geographic borders. By drawing on published case work and interviews with technical communicators who work in global contexts, we examine the key legal and ethical issues technical communicators face when they are conducting Internet research. We propose heuristics for technical communicators to use when addressing these issues. Results: Key legal and regulatory issues that technical communicators face when conducting Internet research include the diversity of legal regimes, the variability of privacy laws and cultural differences, the impact of government surveillance on research risks, and the complexity of intellectual property in a global world. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be aware of the potential legal and regulatory challenges they may encounter when conducting Internet research that spans cultural and geographic borders. By consulting precedent cases, seeking advice from diverse audiences (e.g., focal participants, corporate legal), and remaining flexible in research design, technical communicators can successfully meet these challenges.""Teachers of professional writing should try to integrate legal literacy into undergraduate writing courses in order to provide students with the kinds of literacies that many instructors and researchers want to promote in classes today. On one level, the almost complete exclusion of legal writing from most undergraduate professional writing classes should be reconsidered. This practice fails to meet the needs of a significant number of students who are considering careers in the legal profession. This neglect allows the legal system to remain a mystery to our students. This article analyzes how current literacy theory supports the integration of legal writing into the undergraduate curriculum and examines some of the relationships between rhetoric and legal writing pedagogy.""Legibility is a measure of the ability to detect and discriminate between individual characters. It is a function primarily of visual acuity - the ability to see small detail - and is an essential prerequisite for reading. The legibility of alphanumeric and graphic materials employed in film-based and television display systems is affected by many factors, including such classical factors as symbol size, width-to-height ratio, stroke width, spacing, brightness contrast, contrast direction, and color. This article discusses these factors and their interrelationships with display-system characteristics and environmental and human factors, reports the findings of relevant research studies, and offers guidelines for the specialist in visual design and presentation.""Telework-the performance of paid labor activities at sites other than conventional workplaces and through the use of communication technologies-has not been considered a legitimate work form in China. Analyzing in-depth interviews thematically, the authors found that teleworkers from the post-80s generation not only legitimized their work form pragmatically and morally but also elevated it as a better choice for more achievement, flexibility, autonomy, efficiency, and professional development. Although they evaluated their choice positively, these teleworkers also acknowledged the unique challenges in cultivating guanxi (building relationships) and careers in China when working remotely. The authors suggest that telework in China offers a contested site for studying the dialectic tensions between traditional Chinese values and Western business discourses. © The Author(s) 2013.""Carolyn Miller's oft-cited ""Humanistic Rationale for Technical Writing,"" published in 1979, tries to give technical communication faculty more cultural capital in English departments controlled by literature professors. Miller replaces a positivistic emphasis in technical communication pedagogy with rhetoric. She shows how technical knowledge is produced by individual activity and social affirmation and not by objective descriptions of sensory impressions. Her ""Rationale"" is an attempt to change institutional and discursive structures by persuading literature professors that technical communication can have as much distinction in the academy as literature.""Following reports spanning from the beginning of the OEF (Operation Enduring Freedom) and OIF (Operation Iraqi Freedom) conflicts to the early 2010s, this rhetorical investigation analyzes the U.S. military's diagnostic practices used to identify mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in blast-affected troops.

The differing contexts of school and the workplace may be one reason for this disconnect, so teaching strategies that can effectively bridge this gap are needed. Research questions: How do students respond to using scenes from a television series to teach professional communication concepts within workplace contexts? What are advantages and drawbacks to this strategy? Situating the case: Strategies used to teach professional communication in a way that facilitates its application in the workplace include classroom exercises, service-learning projects involving real clients, and simulations. In addition, videos are a commonly used method of classroom teaching. They can activate verbal/linguistic, visual/spatial, and musical/rhythmic intelligences, allowing students to use their stronger intelligences and develop their weaker ones. Research also suggests that students appreciate visual stimulation and technology use when learning communication skills. How the case was studied: Students completed a brief end-of-course survey to gather both qualitative and quantitative data concerning their learning experiences with the activities described. About the case: To make undergraduate writing courses more relevant to the workplace, specific scenes from The Office were integrated to teach units on negative messages and intercultural issues. Following these clips, students completed both in-class exercises and course assignments pertaining to the topics covered. Results: After completing the class sessions and associated exercises described here, most students could discern the relevant concepts from the clips; they found both the clips and the associated exercises helpful in learning the concepts; and they recommended ongoing use in future classes. Students appreciated the comedic nature of the material, the use of different media, and the pop culture reference. Drawbacks included scenes focusing on what not to do, that often showed communication gone awry rather than the correct way to communicate. Some students also prefer more traditional teaching methods. Conclusions: The results indicate that the use of television clips along with associated exercises can be useful aids in teaching professional communication concepts. © 2016 IEEE.""We justify and describe our development of the Service Learning Opportunities in Technical Communication (SLOT-C) Database.

However, if science is to win continued support, it must be understood by legislators, by ground-water technicians and others who apply scientific information, and by consumers - so they will appreciate how science helps them. The authors think scientists who invest the extra work necessary to write clearly and accutately can distinguish themselves from persons who use language to impress, to mislead, or to deceive others. The easiest kind of writing (hardest to read) is that for other scientists in the same field. A notch above that and much more difficult to write (much easier to read) is writing so that specialists in other fields can understand. Regardless of what anyone says about style, scientific writing must be logical and clear. So logic and clarity should prevail over all other writing rules. After discussing tables to be used, and how to make an outline, the authors give many specific examples of how to improve sentences and words to avoid a pretentious style and increase readability.""A speaker owes it to his audience to make his presentation as interesting and as understandable as possible.

The author presents advice on teaching business communication, the most important of which is to teach students that writing is a recursive process.""The movement toward improved written technical communications has generated little parallel pressure for improved oral communication. Yet the cost of noncommunicative technical talks is large. Attention by speakers to several simple details will result in significant improvements in technical talks. The most important of these details is to present conclusions as close to the beginning of the talk as possible. This simple action will help change a talk from a mystery story to an understandable scientific presentation. Other suggestions are: avoid speaking too softly or too rapidly; do not turn away from the audience while speaking (e. g. , toward projection screen or blackboard).""The reasons for establishing contact between author and editor prior to the submission of an article, are discussed, and some techniques for submitting an effective letter of query are given."Describes six initiatives STC's Orlando chapter has pursued to advance education and professional development.

Yet, not only do these ideologies fail to account for cultural practices and values within less comprehensive groups within culture, but they do not accommodate the inputs individuals make in specific communication contexts. This article draws from the existing body of work and the critical cultural perspectives on culture advocated by contemporary anthropologists and sociologists, mainly Arjun Appadurai (1996), to argue that we construct culture discursively to address cultural issues in intercultural technical communication. A discursive paradigm of culture sees culture as ""socially constructed"" in which culture is under construction and reconstruction by active cultural actors, who construct their identities and negotiate systems of knowledge and meaning that come to play during intercultural contacts. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The paper discusses marketing procedures and preferences library support of bibliographies (indexing of microform collections); ways libraries can make their needs known to publishers; advantages and disadvantages of microforms; microform standards and quality control; choice between fiche and film; user reaction to microforms; publishing trends from the library viewpoint; and the question of the overall desirability and necessity of microforms for libraries in relation to rising hard-copy costs, storage problems, and ease of use.""Scientific journals and libraries such as the Engineering Societies Library are truly working partners in the world of information, but expanded communications between the librarians and the editors of the journals can pay off, with considerable benefits accruing to both parties. Librarians should stop complaining to each other about the headaches to be encountered with journals and let the editors know, for example, that perforated pages are anathema to them. Publishers and editors, on the other hand, can help libraries and information centers by, as a case in point, clearly indicating on the journal any irregularity, be it in numbering or periodicity.""About 50,000 journals of significance for research are currently being published. No library, not even the largest, can afford to subscribe to more than a small fraction of the total needed by its readers. This forces the library to make a selection from among those published. The library's problem is which titles to select and how to provide its readers with access to those it cannot subscribe to. Publishers fear that access to journals by photocopy or on interlibrary load will reduce their subscriptions. Any increase in the cost of providing access to those titles to which a library cannot subscribe, or in the cost of journal subscriptions, can only further reduce the number of titles a library can buy.""To present a significant historical document in the decades-long movement to professionalize technical communication Methods: Historical analysis and textual editing Results: Light's 1961 article applied then-current definitions of a profession to technical writing and suggested that technical writers could become professionals only through formal education and training.

This study investigates whether popular YouTube instructional videos for declarative knowledge development differ in their physical characteristics from unpopular and average ones. Method: Sampling followed a three-step procedure. First, 250 YouTube videos aiming for declarative knowledge development were selected. Next, a formula for popularity rating was developed. After distinguishing three classes of popularity, the five most viewed videos for five types of declarative knowledge were selected. This resulted in a sample of 75 videos. After coding and scoring, statistical analyses were performed to discover differences between popularity classes in the physical characteristics of videos. Results: Popular videos differed significantly from unpopular and/or average videos in the following ways: (1) higher production quality (that is, resolution); (2) more frequent presence of static pictures (both iconic and analytic); (3) more frequent presence of a combination of static and dynamic pictures; (4) more often short onscreen texts; (5) more often subtitling with different languages; (6) more frequent inclusion of background music; (7) less background noise; (8) faster speaking rate (that is, words per minute). Conclusion: The sampled videos strongly varied in their physical characteristics. There were also many significant differences across popularity classes. The findings can be used to optimize video designs for popularity. In addition, they provide a starting point for further research on how physical characteristics may affect knowledge development.""Many computers do not have a capability to print lower-case letters or such items as subscripts, superscripts, raised dots (for products), or symbols for degrees, minutes, or seconds.

This essay, therefore, examines why engineers communicate multimodally, what, in the context of representing engineering realities, are the strengths and weaknesses of written and visual communication, and how, based on an understanding of these strengths and weaknesses, one can consider using the strengths of each form of communication to address weaknesses in the other. Doing so can possibly enable one to demonstrate for engineering majors how they can, with greater effectiveness, communicate multimodally for representing well engineering realities. © The Author(s) 2016.""The most recent challenge in the ever-shifting role of technical writers is the graphic interface. It shares several features with both traditional documentation and online documentation, but it also makes its own unique set of demands. Moreover, even the characteristics it has in common with established technical writing formats are raised to new levels: because the whole rationale of the graphic interface is to sidestep language as much as possible, those few linguistic elements which it does incorporate (menu titles, button labels, and the like) carry abnormally heavy demands. This paper presents a series of ten principles to help cope with this new challenge—dealing with lexical, syntactic, and display issues of writing for the graphic interface. © 1990 IEEE""Claims have been made about the impact of applying Linguistic Politeness Theory to workplace contexts. Linguistic politeness theory argues that speakers or senders of messages make language choices to soften potential face-threatening acts. These claims have not been empirically examined in regards to trust between leaders and members. Research Questions: (1) What effect does a leader's use of linguistic politeness have on perceptions of trust? (2) Do indirect and direct requests differ in building trust? (3) Is there an optimal combination of level of directness and type of linguistic politeness strategy in building trust? Literature Review: Previous literature has shown that people in positions of power utilize linguistic politeness when interacting with subordinates. Further, studies have shown an association between managerial communication style and relational variables, including trust. No study, however, has empirically examined a leader's use of linguistic politeness on subordinate's perceptions of trust toward the leader. Methodology: The current study uses a quantitative approach. An experiment was designed to test the effect of politeness on trust. One-hundred fifteen undergraduates were selected for the experiment. Results and Discussion: Quantitative analysis, which included a two-way ANOVA, revealed that participants trusted leaders who used linguistic politeness strategies in their emails, as opposed to those who failed to include mitigating strategies. Furthermore, downgraders, moves that mitigate the force of face-threatening act without adding semantic content, were effective at building trust when paired with direct speech acts. Similarly, supportive moves, moves that mitigate face-threatening acts but do add semantic content, were effective at building trust when paired with indirect speech acts. The results have theoretical implications that include the contextual importance of linguistic politeness strategies. Further, practical implications include the way student leaders might phrase email requests to team members. However, because the sample included students, the results must be carefully interpreted, particularly when extrapolating to professional populations. Future studies can apply a similar methodology to a population of professionals, allowing for a comparison of datasets. © 2011 IEEE.""This article examines professional communication in a multilingual meeting in a small company in Finland within ethnographic, sociolinguistic, and discourse analytic frameworks. English is used as a lingua franca by a group of Finnish and Chinese business professionals. The aim is to study how language is used with other semiotic resources to construct meaning in interaction. In particular, with the focus on an individual participant who was the mediator in the meeting, the goal is to analyze participants' role alignment and interpersonal relationships. The results show that business professionals' roles are renegotiable in a meeting and by means of language accompanied by embodied actions such as gaze and gestures. The findings also reveal how different languages are used for particular purposes in the meeting. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""The authors examine language from the perspective of models of empirical sciences, which discipline studies the relationship between reality, models, and formalisms. Such a perspective allows one to notice that linguistics approached within the classical framework share a number of problems with other experimental sciences studied initially exclusively within that framework because of making the same sort of assumptions. By examining solutions to some of these problems found in contemporary science, the authors point out alternative approaches, which could be relevant for linguistics research, and some of which have already been tested in language studies. In particular, Corpus Linguistics is presented as an especially promising approach, positioned to avoid many of the pitfalls of the classical framework. Consequently, it seems that the future of linguistics, from theoretical to applied, such as Technical Writing, must be embraced by Corpus Linguistics research.""Scholars have conducted studies to uncover the knowledge, skills, and abilities that successful salespeople demonstrate on the job. However, much of this research focuses on face-to-face, and not mediated, sales environments. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by using an expert panel of judges who develop a 10-item scale that measures call center agents' sales communication competence. Then, the author uses sales conversion rates to stratify the total employee population (45 agents who work in a service plus sales-type account) into a smaller sample that consists of two groups: the top 75% quartile of agents (First-in-Metric) and the bottom 25% quartile of agents (Last-in-Metric). The First-in-Metric group included 8 agents and the Last-in-Metric group included 10 agents. The results of the study suggest that 5 of the 10 Sales Communication Instrument items distinguish the First-in-Metric from the Last-in-Metric agent groups. More precisely, First-in-Metric agents on the account: spoke at an appropriate rate; emphasized important points with changes in pitch and volume; acknowledged or paraphrased what the customer said; used short, affirmative words and sounds to indicate that he/she listened to the customer; and used language the customer could understand. The article closes with the implications the study has for applied communication scholars, as well as for practitioners who work in the global call center industry. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Scholars have consistently claimed that rhetorical patterns are culturally bound, and indirectness is a defining characteristic of Chinese writing. Through examining how the rhetorical mechanism of directness and indirectness is presented in 29 English business communication textbooks published in China, we explore how English business communication textbook writers in China keep up with the contextual changes in the Chinese society and how the rhetorical mechanism of directness and indirectness is locally situated in the English business communication teaching practices in China. We conclude that the pedagogical strategy on directness and indirectness represented in Chinese English business communication textbooks echoes the same strategy favored by scholars in the United States.""Through language and presentation of information, technical writers have the power to influence the perceptions and values of others. However, our students may not know how to wield this power with full awareness of its ethical implications. They may not understand that they have considerable control over how a reader perceives the writer, the message, or the context of the message. Learning how to use language and information ethically should be the focus of discussions of language choices and presentation of information in technical communication classrooms. By studying the power of communication to affect values and judgements, our students will realize the fundamental ethical responsibilities they bear as writers. This essay discusses current research on ethics and technical communication, examines specific methods that writers may use to manipulate language and to present information unethically, and suggests questions designed to teach students how to analyze situations that may involve such manipulation and misrepresentation. The essay closes with two case studies to illustrate such situations. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Comparisons were also made with individual levels of past produc tivity. Employees from both divisions were given a standardized test to assess their lis tening ability before they began to operate a new computer system. Employees from one of the divisions were provided with a 15-hour listening training program one week before the new system was implemented. An analysis of coevariance revealed three noteworthy findings. First, employee listening ability had the most significant effect on employee productivity with the new computer. Second, the employees who received the listening training program performed at significantly higher levels with the new technology than employees who did not receive training. Finally, past productivity also had a significant effect on how productive the employees were with the new computer system. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Using interview data, data from published literature, reflective instructional experiences, and the intersection of those three data sources, this study investigates two primary issues: (1) engineering students' sources of resistance to listening instruction in a sustainable community development initiative, and (2) benefits from such instruction. Findings feature a proposed theory of contextual listening and suggest that sources of resistance include the paucity of listening instruction in the engineering curriculum and curricular components that may devalue listening. Benefits of a listening intervention are described, and implications are discussed. © 2009 IEEE.""Listening is a desirable skill in organizational settings; good listening can improve worker productivity and satisfaction. The challenge facing consultants is how to train employees to be competent listeners. Although much research in listening has taken place over the last few years, little of that research addresses workplace listening directly and much is based on false assumptions: that listening is a unitary concept, that listening is a cognitive rather than behavioral skill, and that listening is a linear act. In a 10-year study, we developed a model of organizational listening competency that does apply directly to the workplace. It provides a basis for assessing listening ability largely through the observations of co-workers. The model emphasizes two effective behaviors: accuracy, that is, confirming the message sent; and sup port, that is, affirming the relationship between the speaker and the listener: This model serves as an effective basis for improving workplace listening, both through formal training programs and through individual workers' own efforts. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""Workers at a bank and a medical center provided 195 critical incident descriptions of effective and ineffective listening. Individual elements were identified and sorted into 38 categories which describe listening in the two work environments. Results indicate that listening is described in organizational settings as an interrelated set of concepts including attentiveness, verbal behavior, non-verbal behavior, attitudes, memory, and behavioral responses. This concept of listening differs from the classroom-oriented and counseling-oriented con cepts of listening which dominate much research and training. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Research offering heuristics for improving such commentary is available for guidance, but the methods employed to comment on writing still have not changed significantly, primarily because we lack sufficient understanding of how students use feedback. Usability evaluation is ideally equipped for assessing how students use commentary and how instructors might adapt their comments to make them more usable. This article reports on usability testing of commentary provided to students in an introductory technical writing course. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""Although many have argued that listening is particularly important in organizations, few studies have examined listening and listening skills in this context. This study ex amined relationships between listening, communication related abilities, employee level in an insurance company, and upward mobility. The results indicated significant positive relationships between listening and other social cognitive and communicative abilities. While findings suggested that nonsupervisors tended to possess better listen ing abilities than supervisors, there was some evidence that better listeners were in higher levels of the organization and were more upwardly mobile. © 1989, Sage Publications.

Historically, listening has been the most neglected instructional area However, in 1978 the Federal Government provided school systems a directive to include listening in basic competencies. Now the historical neglect may be ending. The states that have already included listening on their lists of required skills are increasing. Professional organizations, such as the International Listening Association, universities, and organizations are providing increased training materials, and listening centers have been established. Through proficient use of listening instruction, people can learn listening guidelines and can develop listening skills in ways similar to learning mathematics, physical education, reading and writing. They can communicate more accurately, with positive attitudes, to gain useful information, and to improve understanding. Both the listener and the speaker can become more receptive to pertinent communication of others respond with open, honest, constructive, and meaningful feedback and strive both to understand and to be understood. Each will be able to fulfill certain basic responsibilities important in effective listening activities. Each should understand himself or herself as a communicator and should strive for self-motivation through personal analysis and applications of listening behavior. Each should be able to participate as an equal partner in the communication process.

Well-designed lists can help readers see what is important and how those items relate to one another, and to remember what they see. Guidelines for the use and construction of lists in technical material are presented."Frequent attention is drawn to the decline in the standards of written English. High school examinations are changing to meet a new situation. Attempts are being made to find a unified approach to all aspects of English study. Literary studies figure prominently in the education of teachers of English. New critical approaches bring linguistic and literary studies together. Form and content are seen as combined in structure. Basic critical approaches can be applied to a wide range of texts. This is significant for the teaching and learning of communication skills in English."Writing project reports is an important part of the engineering curriculum at Singapore universities. One important section of the formal report is the literature review. Most universities around the world provide guidelines on writing reviews, emphasizing that plagiarism is unethical. However, these guidelines do not offer explicit training on how to avoid plagiarism. In order to write academically acceptable reviews while avoiding copying from source materials, students face a major challenge and resort to employing various strategies to cope with the task. In this study, we examined the literature review sections of final year project reports to find out how engineering undergraduates in a Singapore university cope with writing reviews and to suggest ways in which they can extend their skills to improve their literature reviews.""Focuses on blending, the most challenging and potentially effective form of game localization* Asserts that technical and professional communicators should learn more about blending, digital game localization, and their place within this burgeoning industry""The authors, one a researcher and one an international community strategy practitioner, illustrate community strategy work as a multi-faceted localization practice that intersects withuser experience design and user localization. We argue that localized community strategy is crucial not only to practice that aims for inclusivity and social justice but also to researchand theory building that aims for inclusivity and social justice. Method: We model a dialogic, localized knowledge-making process that operates at the level of collaborative researchbetween a theorist and a practitioner and at the level of international practice. The authors collaboratively analyzed the experiences of the practitioner, as well as our own collaboration process, and coded theMfor key dimensions, whichcan guide and be further developed bothin practice and in research. Results: The authors identify and discuss four key dimensions of a community strategist’s localization practices—localizing communities, localizing goals, localizing communication, and localizing inclusion—and illustrate theMbothin our own collaborative practice of analysis and in the practice of international community strategy. Conclusion: The definitions of user, community, and diversity themselves must be continually localized in our work to engage across cultures and across theory and practice. We call for further collaboration and researchat the intersections of international community strategy work withtechnical communication and global user experience, particularly the role of localizing diversity and inclusion. © 2017.

Contrasts known preferences of Mexican Spanish speakers with Spanish speakers in the U.S. Makes recommendations from the data for communicating health information to Spanish speakers within the U.S."This article explores how a doctoral student in theoretical physics constructs computational simulations and reports his work within the constraints of an academic dissertation. The author specifically identifies principal elements of the work ensemble that the student deployed to complete different tasks and analyzes two dissertation chapters in order to examine the semiotic resources that the student used to warrant the outcomes of his research. The study finds that these are not instrumental procedures in which the researcher represents material objects in a mimetic sense; they are epistemic practices through which he generates digital objects that do not have an experimental counterpart and must therefore be justified through references to technical production. Based on these findings, the author argues that theorizing writing as coextensive with the practical work of science demonstrates what makes it powerful as a semiotic resource and constructive rhetorical activity. © The Author(s) 2014.""Training in legal writing is a vital part of a lawyer's education both because it is a skill required by the successful practitioner and because learning to write as a lawyer is an integral part of the process that turns laypersons into lawyers. As writing teachers we find that paying attention only to process obscures an important lesson: No rhetoric is effective except to the extent that it is devised for a particular audience and occasion. The author discusses James Kinneavy's suggestion that we offer students the broader version of process implied in Heidegger's concept of ""forestructure"" and suggests that students be given a context in which to write, a context that contains strong clues as to audience and purpose.""Analogical models are common in scientific and technical literature, but scientific/technical communicators may be reluctant to write clarifying comparisons for fear of producing inaccurate or inappropriate similes. Technical writers can use the logical operations that underlie all metaphorical thinking consciously as prewriting strategies: they can learn to construct their comparisons using the logical operations of identification, distinction, re-classification, and division. Applying these logical operations to the generation of useful analogies can give writers confidence that their comparisons possess the qualities of specificity, clarity, richness, scope, and validity.""The problems in technical communications are related more to logical structure than to language. Structure problems occur at document, section, paragraph, and sentence levels. Editing is most effective if it deals with structure first. Structure deficiencies can be detected by applying a range of logical analysis criteria to each text part: looking at the nature and quality of its content and the use of the appropriate discourse sequence. The nature of the content determines where the text part belongs in the section or elsewhere in the document structure. Sufficient definition eliminates vagueness. The correct discourse sequence determines the internal structure of the text part. Lists, headings, classifications, and organograms must comply with the laws of categorization and relevant logical criteria, including some arrived at by lateral thinking."This paper represents an inquiry into the roots of several cybernetics-related misconceptions and some of the consequent anthropomorphic nonsense and grammatical falacies which permeate our thinking and our language."In this article, I examine a historical information graphic-Charles Booth's maps of London poverty (1889-1902)-to analyze the cultural basis of ideas of transparency and clarity in information graphics. I argue that Booth's maps derive their rhetorical power from contemporary visual culture as much as from their scientific authority. The visual rhetoric of the maps depended upon an ironic inversion of visual culture to make poverty seem a problem that could be addressed, rather than an insurmountable crisis. This visual rhetoric led directly to significant features of and concepts in western societies, including the poverty line and universal old-age pensions (social security).""Organizations continue to rely upon virtual teams, yet knowing how, and for how long, individual members' computer-mediated communication (CMC) anxiety affects virtual team interactions and performance outcomes is not well-known. Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between CMC anxiety and virtual team participation? (2) How does this relationship influence the perceptions of individual performance? (3) Does this relationship persist over time? Literature review: A literature review including communication and media structures, input-mediator-output team effectiveness, and individual CMC anxiety elements indicate researchable negative effects upon virtual team interaction and participation in CMC environments. Higher levels of individual CMC anxiety could dampen participation quantity, participation type (task versus social), participation quality, and perceptions of individual performance. Further, the initial negative interactions and behaviors could persist over time. Methodology: This quantitative quasiexperimental study involved surveying, observing, and coding the interactions of 22 virtual project teams (consisting of a total of 110 individuals) over a span of four months. The teams used a CMC tool with shared file space and discussion boards to coordinate database design and implementation work. Data were collected from questionnaire surveys, individual message postings, and team project scores. Individual message postings were coded to measure participation quality (task focus and topic introductions) and participation quantity (message count and words per message). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures multivariate analyses along with follow-up univariate statistical testing. Results and conclusions: The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of CMC anxiety participated less, sent fewer task-oriented messages, introduced fewer novel topics, and were rated more poorly by team members on their performance compared to individuals with lower levels of CMC anxiety. The results also show that CMC-anxious individuals do send relatively more social-oriented messages, perhaps to compensate for typical apprehensive communication behaviors in a virtual team environment. In addition, participation quality and quantity and perceptions of performance by CMC-anxious team members do not significantly improve, even with repeated interactions over CMC. Although study participants evidenced high engagement with the project tasks, the study is limited by its use of student subjects. The study suggests the importance of team leaders and role definitions for virtual teams, to counteract potential unintended effects of CMC technology use masking actual participation and contribution of virtual team members. Future research could investigate the efficacy of interventions for reducing the negative impacts of CMC anxiety in virtual team performance, as well as the influence of individual structures such as CMC anxiety in the use of CMC and team structures in the virtual team environment. © 2016 IEEE.""This study investigated virtual teams playing World of Warcraft to better understand how traditional leadership theories applied to virtual worlds and to identify the most valuable leadership traits. Raid members completed surveys that assessed their leadership capability under the competing values framework. In keeping with previous scholarship, the findings indicate that successful virtual teams value roles from task-based leadership and a factor analysis revealed that the behavioral complexity leadership theory operates differently in virtual environments. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Management is a symbolic activity that depends to a great extent on a manager's control of language resources. However, relatively little is known about the linguistic and pragmatic features of managers' spoken discourse in a range of speech events common in organisations (e.g., meetings, negotiations, presentations, and so on). Drawing on a corpus of authentic business meetings videotaped at a large airline in Hong Kong, this article investigates a number of aspects of the managerial discourse that occurs in business meetings (chair-talk). Three specific aspects of ""chair-talk"" are considered: the proportion of chair-talk that occurs in business meetings, the patterns of speech acts that commonly occur in chair-talk, and the ways in which chairs convey command-oriented directive speech acts. These findings are then discussed within the context of such issues as hierarchical power structure in organisations, the function of different meeting types, the role of directness and indirectness in personal relationships, and linguistic tolerance in intercultural encounters.""In a pediatric teaching hospital, the authors examined 16 novice medical case presentations that were classified as instances of a hybrid apprenticeship genre. In contrast to strict school and workplace genres, an apprenticeship genre results from the sometimes competing activity systems of student education and patient care. The authors examined these novice case presentations for the amount and patterns of time devoted to student learning and expert teaching, the difficulties created for participants, the sometimes misunderstood implicit messages delivered by experts, and the opportunities to address educational objectives. This study offers professional communication researchers a model that combines quantitative and qualitative methodologies to assess the effects of competing activity systems in the development of communication expertise. © 2006 Sage Publications.""Our teaching case reports on a fieldwork assignment designed to have master of arts students experience first-hand how entrepreneurs write for the globalized marketplace by examining public displays of language, such as billboards, shop windows, and posters. Research questions: How do entrepreneurs use English to 'style' themselves? What is the status of English in public displays? Which relationship with customers is cultivated by using English (among other languages)? How does English, or lookalike versions thereof, create a more innovative business? Situating the case: We use linguistic landscaping (LL) as a pedagogical resource, drawing on similar cases in a local English as a foreign language (EFL) community in Oaxaca, Mexico; EFL programs in Chiba-shi, Japan; francophone and immersion French programs in Montreal, QC, Canada and Vancouver, BC, Canada; and a study of the entrepreneurial landscape in Observatory's business corridor of Lower Main Road in Cape Town, South Africa. How this case was studied: We interviewed 36 students about their learning process in one-to-one post hoc interviews. Recurrent themes were increased self-monitoring, improved professional communication literacy, and expanded real-world understanding. About the case: The teaching case follows a three-pronged approach. First, we have students decide on a survey area, determine their empirical focus, establish analytical units, decide how to collect data, collect (sociodemographic) information about their survey area, and determine the degree of researcher engagement. Next, students conduct fieldwork, documenting the linguistic landscape in small teams of three to four students. In the third phase, students have returned from the field and discuss their initial findings, ideas, and observations during a data session with the instructors. Students decide whether they still stand by the decisions they made before they entered the field and are then asked to qualify how language is used in public space. Results: The main takeaway of the assignment is that students were more aware of the degree of linguistic innovation, rhetorical creativity, and ethnocultural stereotyping of entrepreneurial communication in their cities. Conclusion: As a pedagogical tool, LL offers possibilities for exploring entrepreneurial communication in all of its breadth and variety, providing access to perhaps the most visible and creative materialities of entrepreneurs and service providers: shop windows and signs. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This study elucidates pedagogical differences and similarities between the ways in which instructors from business and communication disciplines teach the introductory business communication course.

Although most of Chesterfield's advice (couched in a style that makes old, cliche-ridden principles seem fresh again) is still followed, his admonition that writers should read to improve writing style has been set aside. This article examines the par allels between Chesterfield's advice and current business writing philos ophy and finally argues that we should place greater emphasis on reading in business writing courses. © 1979, Sage Publications.

The object is the linchpin of analysis in the empirical case. Yet the notion of object has expanded methodologically and theoretically over time, making it difficult to reliably bound an empirical case. In response, this article outlines the expansion of the object, diagnoses this expansion, and proposes an alternate approach that constrains the object for case-study research in writing studies. © The Author(s) 2011.""Based on a case study of a global training team, this article focuses on an important ability for professional communicators: collaborating with translators. The study confirms the value of approaching translation as a collaborative recreation rather than mere information transfer and suggests the need to integrate translation with localization and to develop team rapport. Relevant abilities include understanding cultural and professional context, using bicultural vision, and building team relationships. Pursuit of these abilities should draw from translation studies and intercultural communication literature and be informed by diverse rhetorical traditions. Global educational and research partnerships are an ideal way to pursue these goals. Such collaboration can improve research methodology and challenge culturally based assumptions about translation-related communication roles and competencies. © 2008 IEEE.""From empirical data on the authorship of scientific papers, Alfred Lotka deduced an inverse-square law relating the number of authors of scientific papers to the number of papers written by each author. A basic assumption underlying Lotka's law is that the number of papers published by a scientist is a measure of his contribution to science. This assumption is debatable. In this paper Lotka's law is applied to the literature of computer science. The inconsistent results of earlier attempts to apply Lotka's law to the literature of various scientific disciplines, including computer science, are ascribed to the differences in sampling procedure and treatment of multiple authorship.""The evolution of cold-type composition to the present ″state of the art″ at Mack Printing is traced. How the system functions and interacts with the journal publisher is shown, and the total systems approach outlining the hardware and the software development is explained.

Comparison and evaluation of this approach as it relates to economy, flexibility, speed, and quality of typesetting can readily be made.""Careless use of certain pronouns in technical writing today causes communication to be as fuzzy and inept as many other writing flaws. The pronouns most commonly misused are the demonstratives, this and that with their plurals these and those; such relatives as which, who, whom, and that; and the anticipatory expletive it. Eliminating the irritating and confusing aspects of these often misused pronouns is simple. More effective and efficient technical communication will result.""Previous studies have reported that the act of lying is ubiquitous. Although lies are generally regarded as a threat to the moral fabric of society, some lies are told in order to maintain or even enhance human relations. Such lies, therefore, could even be justified as an adaptive tool at times essential for the maintenance of social relationships. When speakers of English as a lingua franca (ELF) from different cultural backgrounds interact in order to build and maintain business relationships, the communication problems that develop can be accounted for in terms of differing perceptions that individuals have of what deceptive communication entails. This study aims to redefine intercultural business communication from an Asian perspective by examining naturally occurring business interaction between Japanese and Indian small business owners. The participants seek to establish a mutually beneficial relationship in order to cooperate in joint commercial activity. Special attention is paid to the lies told and detected by interlocutors. Employing the notion of business discourse, this study uses multiple analytical methods. The analysis depicts meaning jointly created as a result of strategic interaction. Because presenting truth tactfully requires of interlocutors' high linguistic and communicative competence, ELF users use lies as an easy strategy for avoiding conflicts. This study emphasizes situated discourse and identity as critical factors affecting intercultural business communication. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""In an article reprinted from Smithsonian, December 1975, as corrected February 1976, the author makes connection between art and nature, and mathematics.

Far too many engineering personnel submit logically complete, technically correct reports-which efficiently put the reader to sleep. Analysis of the technical report shows that its functional parts are designed for different classes of readership, each having different needs and technical skill levels. Writing your material while focussing on its intended audience instead of a piece of equipment, will vastly increase reader comprehension and minimize the stereotyped image of the dull report. Also, the resultant time saved for the reader represents a cost saving which justifies the slight extra attention given by the writer. © 1972, Sage Publications.

Jameson, associate professor of business communication at Cornell University, in which Jameson discusses how the academic field of business communication is partly to blame for the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The author believes that Jameson's blame is too broad. The article discusses three trends that are having an impact on business communication practices and purposes as revealed in the study ""The 21st Century at Work: Forces Shaping the Future Workforce and Workplace in the United States,"" prepared for the U.S. Department of Labor by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group. ""Through interviews and courtroom observations in a case study done in collaboration with a community partner in two judicial districts in Minnesota, the authors extend the scholarly conversation about critical, activist research in business and technical communication and make pedagogical suggestions by studying two groups who contribute to the discourse about victim rights: judges who accept plea negotiations and make sentencing decisions and advocates who help victims contribute, through victim impact statements, their reactions as crime victims and their requests for certain punishments and conditions for the crime perpetrators. The authors identify the technologies of power used by each group to assert their disciplinary authority and trace how these assertions play out in the courtroom. They conclude that by capitalizing on the normative structures of impact statements, advocates may actually give victims more power. Such activist research might benefit research participants and enhance research methods. © 2008 Sage Publications."Reports the results of qualitative research into technical communication practice among software developers  Describes an ethnographically based method used to develop online case studies  Argues that these case studies are both a practical teaching tool and a means to shed light on the actions and interactions of techné (making) and phronesis (acting)."Contends that ""does it helps communication?"" is the ultimate question to ask in deciding whether to follow, bend, or break rules States that managers need to help their staff members develop sound judgment and make defensible choices""New electronic tools are available to give people access to information previously buried in hard-copy or miscellaneous electronic files.

Method: I asked twenty subjects to walk down a high school hallway decorated with flyers and posters. I interviewed them immediately afterward and one week later to determine which information “stuck” over time as well as the subjects’ self-reported reasons for recalling information. I then analyzed the most-often remembered documents to correlate the subjects’ responses to the documents’ content, design, style, etc. Results: Contrast, color, and imagery are inherently attention-catching and memorable. However, engaging the audience’s collective self-schema, or identity, impacts memory even more powerfully by prompting readers to ascribe relevance to information and thus strive to remember it. Accordingly, I propose the following heuristic for creating more effective, mnemonic documents: (a) convey practical value; (b) use contrast, color, and imagery; (c) tap the familiar; (d) introduce unexpected elements; (e) build social currency; and (f) arouse emotion. Conclusion: Technical communicators can enhance their documents’ effectiveness by using the proposed heuristic to make information more memorable for their readers. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

It focuses on how media should support synchronicity to fit communication needs when making sense of a humanitarian crisis situation. Findings from interviews with senior management of humanitarian aid organizations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo show that, contrary to what is suggested by MST, low synchronicity media are not sufficient to support conveyance processes. Instead, information and communication systems should support these actors in connecting, building, and maintaining their networks of contacts. Also, information and communications systemsneed to be designed to support the observed sensemaking communication activities of noticing, updating, inquiring, triangulating, verifying, reflecting, enacting, and interpreting. © 2009 IEEE.""We employ an array of terms to denote the visual; however, we have not yet agreed on a clear framework for understanding the function and relationship between visual concepts. I propose a literacy approach to the visual so that as educators, researchers, students, and practitioners, we acquire more than skills that rely on changing definitions and technologies but an intellectual faculty that provides the knowledge, understanding, and abilities that the visual affords. Through an analysis of arguments for visual instruction, I present the wayS in which scholars justify their claims about the visual. These arguments uncover the breadth and depth of the visual and contribute to a taxonomy of visual terminology.""A number of '%'shortcuts'%to make technical writing easier or more effective are described.

Suggests the metaphor of procedural architecture for authoring strongly interactive technical documents. Considers rich internet applications and gaming as emerging forms of interactive technical communication.Computer-mediated communication (CMC) has enabled relaxation of temporal and geographical boundaries surrounding group tasks. A question is whether this opening is appropriate mainly for information exchange or whether it is also conducive to the interactive moves necessary for group knowledge production. This study examines knowledge production via email in a technology standardization working group. It notes the occurrence of interactive moves and discusses how they are and can be affected for producing group knowledge."Scholarly conversation within the field of professional communication increasingly has focused on the practice, research, and pedagogy of visual rhetoric. Yet, visual thinking has received relatively little attention within the field. If our programs produce students who can think verbally but not visually, they risk producing writers who are visual technicians but are unable to move fluidly between and within modes of communication.

Specifically, research conducted by the military and by the authors in civilian settings is discussed briefly. Results that have applications for writers are described in more detail. Such results include the fact that workers approach various types of instructional material quite differently, and the strategies they use for getting information are distinctly different, depending on their purposes; additionally, most materials are used in a consultative fashion and are consulted repetitively. By examining workers' purposes in using written materials, it is possible to construct materials so that the varying strategies used by workers in getting information are aided, thus making the material more usable. A number of specific suggestions for designing and writing materials to fit workers' purposes are given.""As the wave of globalization washes over geographical boundaries, the world steps into the era of a new knowledge-based economy with governments striving to encourage innovation in industry especially through national systems of innovation. A national system of innovation (NSI) is considered important because how a nation utilizes and exploits its NSI will determine whether it can compete and ride the wave of globalization or be carried by it and thrashed onto the shores of the new economy. This paper seeks to highlight the linkages developed for enabling communication among the various NSI stakeholders for achieving goals in one such effort, viz. the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) cluster of Malaysia. The MSC offers a vision to create a global multimedia climate through an integrated environment of interlinked elements and attributes. The government of Malaysia, realising the significance of the NSI as a way to better utilize, exploit, and enhance systems, is making efforts to this effect. The efforts include bringing together various stakeholder organizations under the ""Multimedia Flagship Applications"" to develop flagship applications. This is for the development of information technology applications to pave the way toward a knowledge-based economy. The MSC Cluster is presented here as a physical manifestation of the NSI, and it gives an idea as to how policy makers can design linkages for communication among the various stakeholders to further national innovative performance and competitiveness in general.""Amentor guides a protege in the direction which will best assist the protege in learning his or her job.

This article describes the rewards and focuses on the risks of suchmentoring, which include the potential for sexual tension and involvement, misunderstandings stemming from different communication and management styles, coworkers’ misperceptions of thementoring relationship resulting in negative office gossip, and the potential for sexual harassment The article concludes by summarizing steps organizations can take to encourage beneficialmentoring between men and women. © 1993 IEEE""The author points out that in terms of teamwork, it is still difficult to find general concurrence on the proper mix of automation/manual processing to be achieved in the publishing industry. This article explores this middle area and examines the characteristics of the two operators - Man and Machine - so that a tentative mix of assignments can be offered.""The article examines grammatical and syntactical forms in reported speeches of men and women in the Indian work environment. Until recently, there has been little or no study on the linguistic performance across genders in the Indian setting. However, the recent advent of women in the organizations indicates that an understanding of the linguistic similarities or variances is required and will aid collaborative communication. Based on an empirical study, the article posits that linguistic variances in the organizational setup begin to fade at the middle management level. Communication and styles of communication are organization and not gender specific. Additionally, the article argues that organization-fit language is more masculine in nature and hinges on aggression and assertion rather than nurturance or submission. Findings of the research may be of significance to academics and corporates in the business scenario who review the process of communication in same- and mixed-gender groups from the lens of organizational requirements rather than gender specifics. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""The objective of the experiment described here was to find an effective way of teaching communication without alienating students from the task of writing.

Eighteen of the schools have required core courses in communication, and two other schools follow an integrated model and also offer electives; another nine offer electives only. A total of four schools also have writing proficiency requirements, and all four of those schools have core communication courses as well. Only three schools in the sample do not have any communication course offerings. These results are based on an analysis of official Websites and follow-up contact by e-mail or personal interview.""Case studies, used extensively in business communication classes, offer an advantage by presenting students with real-life situations to which they can respond using writ ten business genres. Cases, however, limited by their cryp tic and condensed nature, may not fully communicate the context of the event. Understanding context has become increasingly important as issues of race, gender, and mul ticultual communication have emerged in the workplace. The double-message approach offers a solution by asking students to write a context memorandum along with their response to the case protagonist. © 1994, Sage Publications.

However, so far most of the research has been done in the fields of finance and accounting, with little heed to the communicative aspects affecting the credibility of these messages. With the help of Toulmin's (1958/2003) claim-data-warrant model, this article aims to tackle the question of how important the warrant, that is, the logical link between forecast claims and the data offered to support them, is as a measure in the credibility assessment. The article takes a case study approach, focusing on two earnings forecasts released under similar economic conditions by two companies operating in the same field. The forecast with strong warrants was successful, whereas the other with weak warrants led to a profit warning. Based on the findings, the strength of the warrant might be seen as a reliable indicator of forecast credibility. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The article suggests the possibility of viewing all communications in an organization as a managed network of information flows that does not adequately reflect the reality of the organizational environment.

The transfer program included factories in the U.S., in Canada, and in European NATO Nations. Two concep tual models were established. One explores the influence of two main variables on 12 dependent variables, and the other deals with the influ ence of two major and two minor variables on the management tech niques used in the transfers. The findings lead to concrete recommen dations regarding the two main variables and the management tech niques that will positively influence the quality of a technology trans fer. © 1976, Sage Publications.

The author states that Sarachek's assumptions about honesty in communications are unethical and Machiavellian, which undermine organizational life and effective management.

Members of a delegation of Chinese managers visiting the U.S. were interviewed to explore: (a) the extent to which Chinese factories conform to a bureaucratic model of organization, and (b) factory director communication within these organization. Of particular interest were their upward and downward communication practices, and their methods for persuading and motivating workers and managing conflicts with problem employees. The results of our investigation reveal a distinctive form of bureaucracy operating within these factories. Moreover, we describe patterns of managerial communication practices that can be traced to cultural context, Chinese ideology and organizational structure of the state-owned factory in mainland China. © 1992, Sage Publications.

The traditional approaches to the three disciplines are first presented, and the impact that the information society is having on communication is explored. Then the evolution of a new discipline is analyzed from a structure, function, and system viewpoint Obstacles to the development of a managerial communication course—student backgrounds, academic respectability, and faculty preparation—are also presented.""We hope the results of our survey and this article will help readers better understand and define Managerial Communication as it matures and develops in the business communication curriculum. As a course, it is geared toward the practical needs of students in any business management curriculum. And, in so saying, we wish to emphasize that it should not replace either Business Communication or Organization Communication, both of which serve other interests and audiences. Yet to allow either of the latter courses to satisfy the needs or objectives of the former is to shortchange the future managers of the country. This survey was an attempt to learn about people's thoughts and needs in Managerial Communication, in the hope that those needs could be met in forthcoming text materials. A great deal of valuable information came from the questionnaires, which we would be happy to share with anyone wishing to write. We encourage a meaningful dialogue and exchange with members of the ABCA as a result of our interest and research. Please write us. © 1981, Sage Publications.

Complaints about the deficiencies of writers and their work correspond remarkably to complaints about the deficiencies of employees and their work. And both sets of complaints may actually be related to the traditional Theory X of human behavior, held by managers and teachers of writing. An alternative managerial theory proposed by Douglas McGregor, Theory Y, suggests ways to encourage an individual's initiative and to satisfy the organization's goals simultaneously. Since technical writing weds the worlds of writing and working, this managerial theory can provide a sound basis for a rhetorical theory that encourages a writer's initiative and satisfies the goals of writing simultaneously. The letter of application for employment illustrates how Theory Y works.""The argument is presented that managerial writing is performed within a unique context; consequently, it is important to review the extant research within that context to understand managerial writing. The literature is reviewed within the framework of writing context, process, and outcome.

Communicating across cultures using technology can be a difficult task. It requires understanding the advantages and limitations of technol ogy and how to build relationships via technology. Virtual team members need to choose an appropriate communication channel for their purposes and be sure to balance distance work with face-to-face communication. Team leaders should encourage open communication and brainstorming, and avoid assignment of blame. Other strategies for success include: 1) develop a network of good relation ships built on trust and understanding, 2) show respect for other cultures and lan guages, and 3) understand how diversity strengthens the team. © 2002, Sage Publications.

Most research on managing corporate identity deals with the strategic development of corporate identity and the design and effects of specific elements of the CVI. This study focuses on an aspect of CVI management that has not received much attention - the problem of maintaining consistent use of the CVI in an organization. A comparison is made between manufacturing and service organizations, and between profit-making and nonprofit organizations. For these organization types, the perceived CVI consistency was investigated, as well as the organizational and CVI management characteristics and instruments affecting it. The research was conducted using questionnaires distributed among employees of 20 Dutch organizations. Most of the differences found were those between profit-making and nonprofit organizations. The results showed greater consistency in the CVI of profit-making organizations, in accordance with the amount of effort these organizations put into CVI management. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communications.""Better financial data promote better management of subscription income, and accrual basic accounting provides better data. Many small publishers depend on cash basis accounting and get systematic exaggerations of revenue and underestimates of expenses whenever costs, prices, or numbers of subscriptions rise. Subscription money paid in advance should not be fallow, but invested temporarily to generate additional revenue. Alternatively, this money may serve in emergencies to pay uncovered expenses. subscription income goes further when cost-cutting ideas are sought regularly from the printer."Maintains that technical communicators can retain their place on product development teams by re-engineering project enviornments Describes an experiential learning strategy in project management to help technical communicators work with other IT practitioners"Kuhn reminds us that although collaborating researchers in different disciplines may observe the same phenomena and use similar terms to describe it, their articulation of their findings can be radically dissimilar. Pointing out that what we see is largely dependent on what we have been trained to see, Kuhn cautions that individuals from two academic disciplines who work together will find themselves ""always slightly at cross purposes."" Consequently, even though consultants and clients may use the same word, the meaning of the word may be quite different.

A survey of industry reveals that organizations are developing new techniques of management and are shifting old priorities in order to integrate production, technical writing, and marketing in an effort to produce better manuals.

To facilitate revision and to cut costs, they are automating the production process.""Developing a course in desktop publishing is a technological, as much as a pedagogical, undertaking. Although a background in layout, document design, and typography is necessary, teaching these subjects with computers inevitably means teaching a particular combination of hardware and software. Students with little prior experience using computers must receive training in computer basics. Thus considerable familiarity, not only with desktop publishing software but also with personal computers, is necessary to teach a desktop publishing course. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

It also details several ways that structure and content presentation can help you produce more effective manuals. The following criteria are suggested: Organization, good manuals have a structured format, a complete index, sections set off by tabs, and a table of contents; Content, the material focuses on operator tasks, contains practice exercises, provides clear illustrations, and is concise; Appearance, the presentation is attractive and colorful, with plenty of white space, and is 'packaged' in booklets that are small and easy to handle; Language, the text is conversational and easy to read, geared toward an eighth-grade reading level. On the other hand, operators do not like documentation that is inaccurate; has too much information or detail; has a demeaning or childish tone; is formal, stiff-sounding, or full of jargon; has poor printing qualities (broken type and so on); is poorly organized (the information is of no use if you can't find it).""Elderly people seem to encounter more problems than people from other age groups do, when using consumer electronics products and their accompanying manuals. This may be due to the absence of some kinds of information. In this study the effects of the absence of different information types in instructions on action performance were explored for different age groups. Younger (aged 20-30 y.) and elderly (aged 60-70 y.) participants installed a VCR with the help of the manual, while working aloud. The absence of goal information, consequence information and identification information in the instructions proved to have a negative effect on task performance, especially for the elderly participants. When one of these information types was missing in the instructions, the elderly performed more actions incorrectly than when the information was stated explicitly.""A frustrating but challenging aspect of copy editing is the occurrence of ″manuscript surprises.″ A manuscript surprise is a problem in a manuscript that requires an editor to go back and revise changes and decisions already made. Manuscript surprises occur because many editing decisions are linked to one another, and the editor - especially in the case of a long manuscript - often cannot anticipate how an editorial decision will be affected by upcoming passages. In this article are discussed the different kinds of manuscript surprises and the ways in which editors can deal with them.""This article analyzes a proposal submitted to a funding unit in Michigan Technological University by a PhD Forestry student. A rhetorical-cultural approach of the text provides evidence to argue that scientific writing is rooted in a cultural practice that valorizes certain kinds of thought, practices, rituals, and symbols; that a scientist's work is grounded and shaped by an ideological paradigm; hence, scientific texts have material existence. We find out that science writing is kairotic, selective, and persuasive. The results of the analysis provide enough insights for technical communicators to think about the role that institutions and disciplines play in knowledge production. Thus, technical communicators will not only think about rhetorical moves when they are composing, they will also think about the articulations between contexts and ideological practices and how they shape the identity of writers and communicators. © The Author(s) 2015."Interpretive ethnography offers a useful avenue for exploring how members of a professional community go about producing and applying specialized written knowledge.

In the past most descriptions of neurocognitive function were largely speculative, relying on theoretical constructions of how we believed the brain to work. Recent advances in functional imaging - Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging - have, however, opened the brain to empirical study. This article will consider the potential importance of brain study for composition instruction, briefly describe functional imaging techniques, and review the findings of recent brain-mapping studies investigating the neurocognitive systems involved in language function. In short, understanding how language systems are organized in the brain represents the first step in our attempts to create brain-compatible instructional methods in the composition classroom. Following a review of the recent literature, the article will consider the possible implications of this information for pedagogical practice. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article provides an account of the academic location of 142 technical communication programs as reported on program Web sites as well as in an online survey sent to technical communication program coordinators.

The central research question this article poses foregrounds texts, broadly defined as verbal, visual, and multimedia, and the power of texts to mediate knowledge, values, and action in a variety of contexts. Related questions concern disciplinarity, pedagogy, practice, and social change. These questions overlap and inform each other. Any single study does not necessarily fall exclusively into one area. A mapping of a field's research questions is a political act, emphasizing some questions and marginalizing or excluding others. The emphases may change over time. This mapping illustrates reasons for the tensions between the academic and practitioner areas of the field. It also points out their shared research interests and opportunities for future research. © 2009 Sage Publications.""Teachers new to technical writing must understand that ″Technical Writing″ is not one course. Rather it is a whole variety of courses distinguished from one another primarily by differences in objectives and only secondarily by differences in subject matter. To identify needed technical writing courses and to define coherent sets of courses, teachers of technical writing and program administrators need ″a mapping procedure″ to help them consider alternatives systematically in terms of objectives. This paper proposes such a mapping procedure.""Those who have read ""Roughing It"" or ""Life on the Mississippi"" or ""Pudd'nhead Wilson"" will have seen Mark Twain's flair for technical descriptions and definitions. You know that he liked nothing better than turning a challenging process or device or term into a clear picture for the reader. His descriptions of a quartz mill, of assaying, and of pocket mining in ""Roughing It"" are models of fine technical style, as are his descriptions of sounding in ""Life on the Mississippi"" and fingerprinting in ""Pudd'nhead Wilson"". His definition of ""lagniappe"" is a classic. But Mark Twain was more than a practitioner of technical writing: he was also a theorist about the qualities of the writing craft. His novels, letters, essays, and miscellaneous prose are sprinkled with comments on writing, comments that can be made to read like a set of rules. And that is what the author does in this article: he turns these scattered comments into a list.""Despite the media hype, it is not yet known if the new digital technologies of multimedia, interactive television, and the information superhighway will ever be accepted by the mainstream marketplace. If the information superhighway and interactive television are accepted, both benefits and dangers are inherent within the system. Depending upon who finances and controls the network and its contents, the system could be one of increased democracy and activism or one of government regulation or commercial self-interest and exploitation. The system could be one of active communicators or one of passive consumers. The information superhighway could unify the nation and eventually the world, or stratify people into the information rich versus the information poor. It is crucial for all people to learn about and understand the technology and understand how it could affect their lives. © 1995 IEEE.""With the spiraling costs of printing and book manufacturing, and high overhead factors, many societies have discovered net losing operations in publications even with the assistance of page charges and other support.

Instead of sequentially developed paragraphs and chapters, McLuhan's work often took the form of numerous free-standing commentaries, usually not more than a few pages in length, each self-sustaining yet revolving around some sort of central theme. This 'holographic' style turns out to have much in common with the commentaries produced by participants in a computer conference, where individuals engage in multi-dimensional dialogues through comments of usually 20-60 lines of length around several related themes. The similarities in the textures of computer conferences and the books of McLuhan--who knew nothing about computer conferencing when he wrote his books--can aid in understanding both the computer conference as a literary form and the style of McLuhan.""This article claims that the primary determinant of how texts are structured and produced in scientific and technical communication is the ideology of the ruling force. Scholars concerned with ideology in scientific and technical communication have treated ideology as a competing approach to writing not as the determinant of writing. Thus, they have not been able to suggest how texts are structured and produced. Scientific and technical writing actually belongs to a tradition in which science and scientific activities have always been used to create and transmit the ideology of the ruling force. An examination of several cases of scientific and technical communication suggests that ideology of the ruling force indeed determines how a text is structured and produced. The immediate implication is that we should perhaps avoid resistant pedagogy and try what I call the ""revelation pedagogy,"" which is aimed at dialogue rather than resistance.""Reports on the current state of curriculum in 84 Master’s programs  Answers questions about program location, degree names, course requirements, internships, and cumulative experiences  Suggests additional research areas to provide more information on how well academic programs are meeting the needs of students and other stakeholders ""The author provides guidance in responding to US federal government procurements that include quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria.

The quantities analyzed are the number of AIAA members, the number of subscribers to each of four scientific and engineering journals, and the effects of changes in dues and subscription prices. This paper is devoted to the mathematical model which was developed as a basis for the forecasts. The approach taken involved first modeling the total AIAA membership as a function of changes in membership dues and Federal RDT&E budgets. Then numbers of subscribers to each of the four journals published by the AIAA were determined as mathematical functions of total society membership and subscription rates.""The mathematical equation is truly an element of the engineer's vocabularly. As such, it is a vital tool in technical communication. To make it an effective tool and to achieve maximum reader comprehension, engineers and editors must observe certain rules. These rules divide logically into the major categories of writing, editing, and layout. All three categories are treated and examples are discussed. The rules are aimed at facilitating the typing task, ensuring accuracy of the mathematical treatment, making the mathematics meaningful and unambiguous, and fitting the equations into the report style. The writer is responsible for the use and accuracy of the mathematics, and the editor is responsible for the clarity and presentation of the mathematics, including accuracy checks, arrangement, and typography. Examples stress how correct use of certain rules by both the writer and the editor can change inaccurate, ambiguous mathematics into accurate, clear mathematics that is understandable and meaningful.""A main drawback of desktop publishing systems is that the 300 dpi resolution on laser printers is not good enough for professional publication. This shortcoming can be overcome by printing the files generated by desktop publishing software on high-end phototypesetting equipment, such as the Linotronic 100, which has a resolution of 1250 dpi. However, this can be an expensive process. By focusing on Xerox Ventura Desktop Publisher, this article explains how one can use a desktop publishing system to attain high-end phototypeset quality at greatly reduced costs.""Employers frequently complain about the state of their employees' writing skills. Much of the current research on this subject explores workplace writing skills from the employer's perspective. However, this article examines workplace writing from the employees' perspective. Specifically, it analyzes MBA students' responses to a course assignment in which they assessed their writing strengths and weaknesses and reflected on opportunities and threats to demonstrating good writing skills in the workplace. Results indicate employers must show that they value good writing and that writing skills must become the employee's habit. Implications for business communication pedagogy are discussed. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""The article discusses an approach to developing a communications perspective toward a Master of Business Administration (MBA) writing course, stating that most MBA students did not study business as undergraduates and therefore do not have a high level of writing proficiency.

This privileging occurs despite the claim made by the Environmental Defense Fund's (EDF) leader Fred Krupp, one of the early proponents of market environmentalism, that the new form supplements-rather than replaces-command and control. This paper, a case study, examines the public discourse of one such alliance between McDonald's and EDF. Rather than indicating a paradigm shift, the analysis shows that both partners drew, and had to draw, not only from the emerging discourse of market environmentalism, but also from the older, and purportedly displaced, paradigm of command and control. This rhetorical ambivalence is emblematic of a larger discursive struggle, namely, the contemporaneous socio-political conflict over how the ecological crisis was to be defined and what should constitute legitimate practice-by business, government and environmentalists-in its name. In my view, the McDonald's-EDF partnership was at once constrained by this discursive struggle over the environment and a constitutive element in the struggle itself. © 1999 by the Association for Busness Communication.""Despite the acknowledged importance of reader feedback to computer documentation, few relevant, standardized, empirically validated measures for such feedback have been developed. Research involving hundreds of experienced computer users from more than 30 organizations indicates that there are at least three principal dimensions which readers use when evaluating documentation used in the performance of job-related software tasks: task relevancy, systematic arrangement, and credibility. A nine-scale measure of these dimensions is proposed for standardized use.""This paper explores the problems that occur in implementing a major organizational change initiative where various employee groups have different interpretations of the purpose of the initiative and tactics intended to achieve it. In this paper, I employ two concepts: TECHNOLOGY FRAMES and the ORDER OF CHANGE MAGNITUDE surrounding technology change. By understanding the meanings that various stakeholder groups attach to the same communications about the change initiative, we may better understand the characteristic ways in which they interpret both the objectives of the change initiative and how it will be implemented. By using these concepts to explain various stakeholders' conflicting interpretations of the information that they have received about the change initiative, this paper shows how they perceive differently what events constitute progress toward achieving the initiative's objectives.""This article reports the background, methods, and results of a 7-year project (2007–2013) that assessed the writing of undergraduate business majors at a business college. It describes specific issues with writing assessment and how this study attempted to overcome them, largely through a situated assessment approach. The authors provide the results of more than 3,700 assessments of nearly 2,000 documents during the course of the study, reporting on scores overall and for each rubric criterion and comparing the scores of English and business assessors. They also investigate how two curricular interventions were evaluated through this assessment project. Although overall, the writing of these business majors was assessed as good, results showed noteworthy differences between the scores of English and business assessors and a noteworthy impact for one of the curricular interventions, an effort to improve the material conditions of writing instruction. The authors conclude by discussing some next steps and implications of this project. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""Techniques for observing selection and reading behavior in professional documents, such as the thinking-aloud and the click-and-read methods, may affect the reading process to be observed. Such so-called reactivity problems complicate the use of these instruments in experimental research and usability testing. If their influence is unknown, any experimental results obtained with these instruments may be caused by the testing method. One way to detect reactivity effects is to compare different instruments in a series of experimental studies. In this initial study, we compared the thinking-aloud method, the click-and-read method, a combination of these two methods, and a silent reading condition. Subjects read and judged a 53-page policy document in one of these conditions. We investigated whether or not different observation instruments caused specific differences in information selection, judgment, and knowledge. Thinking aloud did not cause any differences in the selection of information. Both the thinking-aloud and the click-and-read methods affected the judgment task outcome. Thinking aloud led to many positive and few negative judgments, whereas silent reading led to many negative and few positive judgments. The results for the click-and-read method showed a tendency toward the same effect. Neither method affected the knowledge test results.""Uses case histories to demonstrate how usability research can help evaluate quality of visual communication in navigation, icon recognition, and look-and-feel Discusses findings on usability testing methodology and visual communication guidelines.""This paper reports the results of a study that tested the translatability of a restricted language, called Simplified English (SE), as used in maintenance procedures in the airline industry. The study examined the effect of document type (SE versus non-SE) and procedure (procedure A versus procedure B) on the quality and ease of translation for native speakers of Spanish, Chinese, or Japanese. The results reveal that SE may be more effectively translated by native Spanish speakers than by Chinese speakers. The paper concludes with a discussion of methodological issues that researchers should consider when running such translation studies.""The author could find no tool available to measure ease of use. So he developed one, and in this article he describes his procedure and his results. The ease of use concept which is of interest here is that perceived by IBM customers, since the ultimate goal is to increase customer satisfaction. Therefore, it was concluded that measuring readers' perception of ease of use would be an adequate, if not superior, approach, and that a customer survey was the most practical means of measuring perceived ease of use. There was devised a two-part procedure: the first stage would be a broad survey to establish an average perceived ease-of-use level across the class of manuals that the organization usually produces; the second stage would be to survey the organization's new manuals individually as they reach the field (following of course the same methodology). A new manual's results could then be compared against the established average, or baseline. This comparative method would overcome one of the traditional difficulties in surveys: interpreting the significance of the scale.""Many organizations do not value what technical communicators do for them. In an era of increasing cost consciousness, technical communicators are under ever greater pressure to justify their role and their activities. Although there have been studies of how to reduce the investment or cost of producing technical documents, very little has been done on quantifying the return on investment. To measure how technical communicators can improve an organization’s return on investment, we might measure reductions in calls for support, increases in customer satisfaction, or increases in workers’ productivity. We describe a new project, funded by the Society for Technical Communication, in which we are studying how technical communicators add value by increasing an organization’s return on its investment. We ask readers of this transactions to participate in this project by filling out and returning the questionnaire that follows this article. © 1993 IEEE""States that value can be returned by reducing internal investment, increasing sales, and reducing after-sales costs  Argues that further research will improve our understanding of information as the product itself, rather than simply a supporting component.""A model is derived to describe particle segregation for binary mixtures of different sized particles in a gas fluidized bed. Introducing an important aspect named segregation factor, the model, which is formulated based on the bubbling bed model, yields solutions showing the change of concentration profiles of jetsam with time. It is shown that the prediction of segregation patterns can well agree with experimental results obtained.""Students at the University of Illinois and the University of Michigan participated in an experiment to determine if different affective responses would result from exposure to three different forms of media, each presenting the same content. One group of students viewed a videotape, another listened to an audiotape, and a third read a printed transcript. A semantic differential was used to measure affective response, and an objective test was administered to measure cognitive learning. Results showed the video group to be perceiving the presentation less favorably than were the other two groups; however, they were perceiving two of the participants more favorably than were the others. An analysis of covariance between pre- and post test scores of cognitive learning showed that subjects receiving the audiotape version had learned significantly less than those receiving the other treatments.""Deciding whether to accept or reject contract clauses in software purchasing contracts is a complex communication-related task, which is likely faced daily by a multitude of software purchasing professionals in a variety of organizations. Research question: What are the effects of viewing contract clauses as video clips, compared to viewing clauses as text only, in terms of cognitive effort, communication ambiguity, and correctness in the acceptance or rejection of clauses in software purchasing contracts? Literature review: The literature on the Media Richness and Media Naturalness theories suggest that viewing contract clauses as video clips should reduce cognitive effort and communication ambiguity. However, while Media Richness theory suggests that correctness in the acceptance or rejection of clauses in software purchasing contracts should increase with the use of video clips, Media Naturalness theory suggests a neutral overall effect. Methodology: An experiment was conducted in which student participants were asked to either accept or reject 20 clauses from a software contract, placing themselves in the position of buyers. Of the 20 clauses, 6 were intentionally deceitful and potentially harmful to the buyer. Approximately half of the participants reviewed the contract clauses as web-based text, and the remaining as web-based video clips. Results and conclusions: Viewing contract clauses as video clips was associated with significantly less cognitive effort and less communication ambiguity than viewing the clauses as text only. Counterintuitively, increases in perceived cognitive effort and communication ambiguity were associated with more successful identification and rejection of deceitful contract clauses. The combination of these competing effects led to an overall neutral effect of the medium on the correctness in the acceptance or rejection of clauses. These findings are consistent with expectations based on Media Naturalness theory, particularly its compensatory adaptation proposition, and inconsistent with expectations based on Media Richness theory. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""E-communication in businesses has been the target of intense research. The media richness hypothesis has been influential in some e-communication research circles and has also been strongly attacked by social theorists. It is argued in this paper that this theoretical polarization involving advocates of the media richness hypothesis and social theorists is due to two problems. The first is that there is a wealth of empirical evidence that provides direct support for the notion that human beings prefer the face-to-face medium for a variety of business tasks that involve communication, which seems to provide support for the media richness hypothesis. The second problem is that the media richness hypothesis is built on a vacuum, as no underlying explanation was ever presented by media richness theorists for our predisposition toward rich (or face-to-face) media. The main goal of this paper is to offer a solution to these problems by providing an alternative to the media richness hypothesis, referred to here as media naturalness hypothesis, developed based on Darwin's theory of evolution. The media naturalness hypothesis argues that, other things being equal, a decrease in the degree of naturalness of a communication medium (or its degree of similarity to the face-to-face medium) leads to the following effects in connection with a communication interaction: (1) increased cognitive effort, (2) increased communication ambiguity, and (3) decreased physiological arousal. Like the media richness hypothesis, the media naturalness hypothesis has important implications for the selection, use, and deployment of e-communication tools in organizations. However, unlike the media richness hypothesis, the media naturalness hypothesis is compatible with social theories of behavior toward e-communication tools. Among other things, this paper shows that the media naturalness hypothesis (unlike its media richness counterpart) is compatible with the notion that, regardless of the obstacles posed by low naturalness media, individuals using those media to perform collaborative tasks may achieve the same or better task-related outcomes than individuals using media with higher degrees of naturalness. © 2005 IEEE.""This study explores the adoption of new media among an elite, powerful group: state legislators. The case study investigates how five information sources are used by a sample of Louisiana state legislators to meet nine different information needs. These research questions were posed: (1) What roles do the various sources available to legislators play in helping them make voting decisions, and does the importance of these information sources vary with different information needs? (2) How does new information technology fit into the information sources state legislators use in making voting decisions? and (3) Do characteristics such as the officeholder's age, tenure, and education influence how these information sources are used? The legislators in this sample indicate a preference for interpersonal communication channels, specifically statehouse insiders. They do not consider new media to be important sources for information. Their age, tenure, and education have little influence on how they use information sources.""An examination of a random sample of four medical journals-The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine-reveals that one-fifth of the space of articles in medical science is devoted to an average of three tables and three flow charts, graphs, or photographs. Given these figures, the absence of discussion of visuals in the literature on medical communication may seem puzzling. But the puzzle is easily solved: our basic education gives us a coherent vocabulary for talking about prose, but no coherent vocabulary for talking about tables and visuals. Once we have this vocabulary in hand, we make another step in the direction of an explanation of the nature of communication in the medical sciences. We may note that understanding the meaning of a medical article is not just a consequence of understanding its texts; it is a consequence of understanding all its meaningful components working together-verbal, tabular, visual.""Unlike experienced collaborators, student teams often attempt to collaborate without effective documentation of meetings. This tendency may be exacerbated by professional writing textbooks, which rarely mention minutes in their chapters on collaboration and provide ineffective examples of meeting minutes that follow a parliamentary style of minutes rather than the action-oriented style that is the norm in most workplace settings. Interviews with three engineering managers are supported by published research in professional communication to show how meeting minutes are essential to projecting a team forward by solidifying consensus and holding individuals accountable for actions. A short exercise designed to teach students how effective minutes function as a management tool is presented along with observational evidence of the exercise's effect on student team practices in both professional writing and computer science team projects. © 2006 IEEE.""Postmodern assumptions employed by some organizational theorists recognize that ""administrators' greater power lies not in their ability to control resources but in their ability to manipulate symbols - the ceremonies, rituals, images, and language of the organization"" (Graham and David 9). Thus, even a genre that is often considered neutral and objective, such as meeting minutes, can become a tool of managerial control. This article presents data from an ethnographic case study that describes how an administrator in a theater organization manipulated language by using the minutes from a board of directors meeting to influence board members to vote to disband the organization.""This article uses theories of technical communication and archives to advance a pedagogy that includes archival production in the technical communication classroom. By developing and maintaining local classroom archives, students directly engage in valuable processes of appraisal, selection, collaboration, and retention. The anticipated outcomes of this work are the critical practice of making connections, the decentering of the self, the ability to work through noise, and the ability to imagine future users of the archive. The authors conclude that local classroom archives are one new means of meaningful instruction in the technical communication classroom and the local archive concept has great potential for further development.""The remarks in this article were delivered as Professor Cox's Presidential Address to the American Business Writing Association, December 28, 1966, Sheraton-Charles Hotel, New Orleans, Louisiana.

Missing in the main are writing mechanics tailored for communicating the who, whats, and whys involved in running an organization. A writing course aimed at reducing, if not closing, that gap has been in existence for some time now. Dealing with writing to prescribe, persuade or report, it is structured around the proper selection and arrangement of both what must be stated and the words with which to state it, and then stating it with reader ease. This article details the components within that structure.""This paper shows instructors how playing the role of a boss can lead students to write, speak, and behave more profes sionally. The course accomplishes this transformation by changing the academic mindsets, conventions, and actions of both instructor and students. Instead of academic policies to govern a class, workplace conventions operate. In a reciprocal fashion, instructors assume that students' assignments represent the instructor's competence to upper management, and thus instructors “invest” themselves in student work beyond traditional academic obligations. The paper also critiques the “boss” approach as well as provides assignment topics, evaluation guidelines, and specific descriptions of some assignments. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Results show that in the author's choices will be influenced by a task component which asks who needs to be told the information in the memorandum, whom the author needs to tell that information to, and who is privileged to know that information, as well as by a socio-emotional component deriving from the interpersonal relations between the author and potential readers.""Because women are now the largest group entering the labor pool, it is important to know how sex and gender differences relate to communication, job satisfaction, and work performance. This research assessed how 800 organizationally experienced and work-oriented women and men rated the importance of the eight characteristics of effective work teams. Responses to the survey instrument were examined for gender differences. It was found that women rated the importance of (a) team members’ job knowledge; (b) competent, respected, and fair leadership; and (c) team members’ liking, trusting, and helping each other significantly higher than did men. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Results were generally supportive of findings outside the organizational context for men's and women's relationships, but several interesting patterns were noted across relationship types that suggest different relational trajectories for men's and women's relationships. Specifically, the number of relationships claimed by men and women were similar, but women's collegial relationships were higher on several relational functions than men's, and women's special peer relationships were stronger than men's in several areas. This study shows that the work setting as a context is, for friendship purposes, similar to nonwork contexts. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication."Reports on an online survey of 158 technical communication teachers who were asked about their experiences with mentoring.

These students write a variety of engineering documents: design proposals, project management plans, status reports, instructions, poster papers, etc. The genres in the sequence, their identification, and their teaching result from outreach to the engineering community. Although this curriculum benefits from a three-quarter sequence, the methods used are applicable to shorter courses in academic and industry settings. This curriculum may be of interest to industry professionals who recruit or who wish to contribute to undergraduate engineering curriculum innovations.""In fall 2004, Merck faced a significant threat to the company's public image because of the withdrawal of VIOXX, and Merck executives were forced to defend the company's actions, its motivation for those actions, and its reputation. Confronted with enormous rhetorical challenges, Merck tried to generate public goodwill toward the company by creating a personalized image of a corporate giant worthy of understanding, sympathy, and trust. Open letters released during the initial response to the VIOXX crisis rely on the intimacy of interpersonal communication and demonstrate to students of business communication arguments based on ethos. The syntax and diction of these documents are analyzed to demonstrate how they create a secondary narrative of Merck's good sense, good moral character, and goodwill. Finally, the study presents apparently contradictory narratives of this pharmaceutical giant's responsibility, narratives that summarize the arguments in the VIOXX litigation. Analysis of Merck's open letters underscores the relevance of many concepts covered in the business communications classroom.""This paper defines the unique conditions necessary for the joining together of several periodicals under one cover, and defines and examines those conditions that would preclude such an eventuality.

The financial considerations and impacts are examined with a hypothetical model.""This article furthers the recent trend of studying communication during new employee socialization by examining the nature of message content and message sources during this important process. Results from an investigation of 85 newly hired hotel managers' socialization experiences indicate that newcomers distinguish clearly between the extent they receive different socialization message content. They also receive distinct message content from different sources, suggesting newcomers rely on a variety of sources for socialization information. The implications of these results on the success of newcomer adjustment are also discussed and directions for future research are offered. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article investigates the critical thinking difficulties of finance majors when asked to address ill-structured finance problems. The authors build on previous research in which they asked students to analyze an ill-structured investment problem and recommend a course of action. The results revealed numerous critical thinking weaknesses, including a failure to address the client's problem, use analytical tools systematically, construct rhetorically useful graphics, or translate finance concepts and methodologies into lay language. The present research aims to understand more deeply why students struggle with ill-structured problems. Using think-aloud protocols, audiotaped interviews, and other strategies, the authors explore causes of finance students' difficulties and suggest strategies for addressing them. The results suggest that the homework tasks typically given them, such as quantitative problem sets using algorithmic procedures, do not prepare them to confront ill-structured problems requiring disciplinary arguments aimed at specified audiences. Research further suggests that teaching audience adaptation- especially for nonexpert audiences-is helpful in promoting critical thinking. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Forpractitioners and teachers, this article reviews the literature on differences in cultural assumptions underlying negotiation between businesspersons in the People's Republic of China and those from the West, particularly the United States.

Specifically, organizational messages are divided into the stages of primary narrative and secondary narrative as the organisations seek to reconstruct the crisis event for their stakeholders. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) multiple responses to accusations that it failed to properly respond to the Ford/Firestone case are analyzed as an illustration of the metanarration model We demonstrate the function of metanarration by showing that NHTSA effectively reconstructed the narrative associated with its failure by creating an exigency for enhancing, rather than punishing, the organization. © 2003 by the Association for Business Communication.""It is a well-attested fact among the academia that the terminology and discourse of computer science is pervaded with metaphors. Yet, almost all the studies on metaphor application in computer science have approached the issue of the metaphor use and its influence on the user-computer interaction from an intralingual stance leaving the field of literature related to this subject with a lacking for the adoption of an interlingual attitude. The question is whether metaphor is as extensively far-reaching in its influence among the computer users across the globe as it has been pervasive in its use in computer discourse? This study, through drawing the scholars' attention to the significance of user metaphoric awareness in the receptor communities regarding the recognition of any metaphoric application based upon the notion of transparency or opacity of metaphoric meaning in terms of the user's command of the language in use in computer science, tries to put forth the idea of globalization of metaphoric meaning in computer science and its influence upon the users and at the same time propose some possible alternatives to the computer writers and decision-makers both in global and local levels in order for the user metaphoric awareness being promoted. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Professional educational philosophers C. A. Bowers and David J. Flinders describe the classroom as an “ecology” comprised of interrelated linguistic and cultural patterns that determine how information is communicated in the classroom. Their classroom ecology model centers on the observation of three interconnected areas: 1) the metaphors that the teacher and the textbook use to introduce students to the formal and informal curriculum; 2) the manner in which the teacher frames student expertise and classroom relationships; and 3) the nonverbal communication between teacher and students. Using Bowers and Flinders’ model, I studied a technical writing class taught by a teacher (“Max”) who used “connected” teaching—Belenky et al.’s term for emphasizing relationships, understanding and acceptance, and collaboration. Max’s metaphorical language, framing of instruction and student relationships, and nonverbal language reflected a rhetorical approach to technical writing, a caring approach to teaching, and a supportive, community environment for learning. This ethnographic study provides a snapshot of how one teacher defines technical writing and how he answers the question of how it should be taught. © 1993 IEEE""Asserts that embedding computers in the world will alter information designs for two-dimensional on-screen spaces Argues for incorporation of commercial design, cognitive psychology, and architectural and civil design theories.""This essay examines the dominant metaphors that define and describe three basic components of hypertext (texts, nodes, and links), arguing that they contribute in central ways to the current treatment of this technology in technical communication. It includes a brief overview of the way metaphors filter computer-based tasks and functions, a discussion of hypertext metaphors of identity and the realms from which they are commonly appropriated, and some corollary implications for students and teachers of technical communication. In general, this essay contends that hypertext design choices are both productively and unproductively shaped by social as well as technological forces. © 1963 IEEE. © 1995 IEEE.""Drawing on pandemic flu metaphor research and building on previous metaphor theory, this article uses rhetorical analysis to examine and move toward understanding the metaphors surrounding H1N1 and swine flu. To understand these metaphors, I created two Google Alerts for the terms ""H1N1"" and ""swine flu"" and collected data using these Google Alerts from November 10, 2009 to December 10, 2009. I then examined the headlines and content found in the news articles, blogs, and websites from the Google Alerts, and grouped the metaphors used in these headlines and content thematically. These themes work toward providing a rhetoric of pandemic flu, a rhetoric that might assist health care recipients in being more aware of how metaphors used in electronic media create meaning for health concerns. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""To translate technical language for professional into ordinary language for lay readers, authors developed a five-step method: (1) Standardize the technical language; (2) produce a nontechnical version; (3) test the nontechnical version with lay readers to determine where the translation was unsuccessful; (4) determine the reading-grade level of the translation; and (5) statistically correlate the accuracy of the translation with the original. This method was used with a set of 200 educational objectives in the mental-health field and steps 3-5 verified that the translation was accurate and comprehensible. The process is explained and is directly applicable to technical prose in other fields.""To translate the technical language of a survey instrument into ordinary prose for lay readers, the authors developed a five-step method: 1) the technical language was standardized; 2) a nontechnical translation was produced; 3) lay readers were tested to discover what parts of the translation were unsuccessful; 4) the reading level of the translation was determined; and 5) a statistical correlation was performed to determine whether or not the translation accurately reflected the technical language. The validation measures in steps 3, 4, and 5 verified that the translation was faithful and readable.""Personnel professionals and college undergraduates evaluated the credentials of job candidates whose résumés had been reproduced under four distinct conditions: professionally typeset and printed on tan paper; professionally printed on high-quality white paper but taken from a camera-ready typed original; photocopied on a high quality, clean machine; and photocopied on a poor quality, somewhat dirty machine. Professionals judged an individual more negatively when a poor photocopy was presented and showed modest preferences for the professionally prepared résumés over the good photocopy. Students' evaluations, however, did not differ reliably as a function of the four methods of reproduction. Implications of this difference in the reactions of students and professionals are discussed. © 1986, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.""What is productivity and how is it measured?

Supported by rubric software and a philosophy of ĝ€real readers, real documents,ĝ€ the assessment was piloted in summer 2006 with five evaluators who were English instructors and four who worked or taught in business environments. The nine evaluators were each given 10 reports that were drawn from a sample of 50 reports completed in a writing-intensive course. They created 88 individual assessments using a 10-category rubric. While the overarching purpose of the pilot was to determine the effectiveness of the methods used, the results may also be of interest to those involved with the assessment of writing. © 2009 Sage Publications.""In-depth interviews with more than 20 professional writers and editors show a growing concern among professionals for strengthening interpersonal skills. Seventy-five percent of the sample interviewed stressed the need to improve interpersonal skills while 65% of this same sample noted that written documents benefit when the writer and the editor work collaboratively as early in the process as possible. A technical editing course that examines the process of taking a manuscript from rough draft to publishable form can accomplish this goal by involving students as completely as possible in the writing-editing process. Working collaboratively in a workshop environment, students learn to appreciate the writing act from both a writer's and an editor's perspective. As editors immersed in the writing act, they gain a better understanding of the writer's perspective and of the difficulties encountered when one tries to express abstract ideas as clear prose.""Metonymy - the process of representing a concept with an associated element or feature - is a useful strategy for encapsulating or alluding to a larger idea without fully stating it. For metonymies to be successful, however, readers must recognize and be able to compensate for the information that has been omitted. Metonymic omissions can pose a barrier to readers, even in texts that are written in plain language, largely because metonymies operate indirectly: first, by prompting readers to infer information that is not provided; second, by constraining meaning rather than specifying it; and third, by requiring readers to possess the insider knowledge and values of a particular discourse community. These barriers are compounded by the fact that frequently used metonymies become so commonplace that their users may not even be able to detect, let alone address, these omissions. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc."When metrication in the United States is finally accomplished there has to be an accepted orthography for the ″new″ terms.

However, micro factors, which directly affect the end user's motivations, have been underinvestigated. We examine the influence of micro factors on both individuals' attitude toward and their use of cell phones. Data were collected through a survey of 463 cell-phone users in Guinea. Results show that mobility, familiarity, social influence, and resources possession influence the attitude toward and the use of cellular telephones. In contrast, the hypothesis that subscription conditions are the main influence on cell-phone use is not verified. © 2009 IEEE.""In an attempt to assess the microcomputer's effects on the process and quality of business writing, this study focuses on writing anxiety, computer anxiety, time spent in writing, writing quality, and the relationship of gender to these variables.

This conceptual analysis bridges a theoretical gap by connecting current crisis management literature to rhetorical theories that identify barriers to organizational learning. Two connecting models are introduced to outline the barriers to learning, propose the inclusion of learning throughout the crisis cycle, and encourage the adoption of a mindful culture. Previous crisis models are described and an explanation of the similarities between Burkean philosophy and crisis research is presented. The Mindful Learning Model demonstrates how, if barriers are overcome, learning can not only lessen the impact of a crisis but also potentially prevent a crisis from occurring. Contentions of this analysis are detailed and a research agenda to extend mindful learning is outlined. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""We identify various minimalist techniques and argue that, although these techniques can conflict with each other, together they provide a framework for designing computer documentation. A minimalist approach involves making tradeoffs within this framework rather than following a set of prescriptive techniques. Minimalism, in this sense, is a pragmatic design philosophy aimed at the overall objective of ""minimizing"" obstacles to use. The framework covers the following design issues: word and page count, duplication, selective documentation of facilities, elaboration, task orientation, guided exploration, error recovery, and access."Looks at the application of minimalist principles in technical documentation."This article examines how mirror neuron research from the neurosciences is incorporated by the field of group analysis and made to fit within the history and practices of the field.

Management Information Systems (MIS), a computer-based formal plan which creates, stores, and retrieves information, allows managers to control the amount and quality of information leading to decisions. Presented in this paper are three topics concerning MIS. First, a conceptual framework defines MIS and managerial needs for MIS Then, the impact of such a system is evaluated in a section on frequent criticisms of MIS. Finally, this paper examines several requirements for successful implementation, including the existence of an adequate systems structure source and the identification of individual needs. MIS, as a primary source of information for managers, serves to refine communication, thereby leading to successful managerial decisions. © 1984, Sage Publications.

In addition, participants in this study emphasized different factors than did CMC literature as most significant to causing miscommunication in international virtual workplaces. © 2010 IEEE.""Circulating written drafts and conducting roundtable reviews are two important document-development activities in many work sites. Previous studies suggest that review processes are frustrating for participants and have substantial inefficiencies caused by conflicting participant purposes. This article presents two case studies of the document-review practices for clinical study reports from a large pharmaceutical company, paying particular attention to whether review efforts contributed to improvements in document quality.

A tube array of . 050 m cylinders in 0. 10 m equilateral triangular pitch was used to study the effects of tubes. The dispersion of tracer gas injected continuously through a line source above the distributor plate was determined from instantaneous concentration measurements. The time average tracer concentration at points within the bed is successfully predicted by a simple disersion model."Our aim was to explore the influence of mobile learning on students’ acquisition of conceptual knowledge of business communication, as well as on the development of their communication skills. We compared the performance of three groups of students according to the pedagogical approach that we used with them: a mobile learning group, a conventional group, and a control group. Our findings suggest that a mobile learning intervention leads to an improvement in student performance in a formal assessment and that it will also have a positive impact on learning outcomes. © 2016 by the Association for Business Communication.""Moby-Dick is a classic of technical literature as well as a classic of American literature. But for the technical writing teacher, its relevance goes beyond this: Moby-Dick can also be a valuable teaching resource. It provides pertinent examples for teaching students the concepts of audience, purpose, research and sources, use of background experience, and thoroughness in compiling data. It also supplies ample models of technical definitions, descriptions, processes, and theories. Finally, Moby-Dick demonstrates the kind of energetic technical writing that is so needed today.""Successful grant writers: assess what a proposed project has to offer, understand what a grant-making agency wants, and communicate a clear match between the two. The issue is how to develop an understanding of what grant-making agencies want and effectively communicate with target audiences. Method: Applying modality analysis, based on pedagogical theories focused on learning styles, to publications from a funding source involves identifying words that are associated with visual, auditory, or kinesthetic orientations. Matching the identified communication style/modality of the funding source can enhance communication and funding success. Results: Experience with grant proposals that use rhetorical approaches that are based on modality analysis of agency publications can attain more success than other submissions. Conclusion: A grant writer can base his/her selection of rhetorical approaches on modality analysis, which seems to be a viable way to make one's grant proposal text connect with the values, priorities, and communication preferences of a funding source, and this connection enhances chances for success.""Recently, scholars of new media have been exploring the relationships between genre theory and new media. While these scholars have provided a great deal of insight into the nature of e-genres and how they function in professional contexts, few address the relationship between genre and new-media theories from a designer's perspective. This article presents the results of an ethnographic-style case study exploring the practice of a professional new-media designer. These results (a) confirm the role of dynamic rhetorical situations and hybridity during the new-media design process; (b) suggest that current genre and new-media theories underestimate the complexity of the relationships between mode, medium, genre, and rhetorical exigencies; and (c) indicate that a previously unrecognized form of hybridity exists in contemporary e-genres. © 2008 Sage Publications.""Clues from experiment are used to formulate a model for heat transfer between horizontal tubes and bed. The model assumes that when the emulsion is present at the tube surface, heat is transferred by particles and by gas percolating between particles and the surface; when bubbles are present heat is transferred across the gas film. This model is developed for large particle beds and agrees with reported results over a range of conditions.""The model developed is intended to serve a dual purpose: 1) to provide a range of perspectives from which technical communication can be examined, and 2) to serve as a useful guide to practitioners in helping to specify roles and responsibilities in relationship to clients and sponsoring organizations.""Model outlines can serve both the novice and the skilled writer. A tested model outline can offer a starting point for adaptation and a guideline for further writing. Whatever the model chosen, it should present the main idea early and the details later and in logical order. This article sketches eleven models for typical writing tasks and suggests ways to introduce and use the models for on-the-job writing, for teaching technical writing, and for requiring students to write lab reports."Reports the results of an observational study of museum exhibit design Suggests eight communication practices from museum exhibit design that could be transferred to information design for the Web.Reports the results of an observational study of museum exhibit design Suggests eight communication practices from museum exhibit design that could be transferred to information design for the Web"This article presents a model for analyzing the communication context of a message and discusses the model's application to revision and evaluation. This context model has two sections. The first (The Context, The Audience, Purpose and Uses), completed before composing, sets the message's parameters. The second (Explanation of Writing Decisions), completed after composing, asks students to analyze their content, arrangement, and style at the global and parts level. Thus section two encourages reflection on all aspects of the message, leading to revision. Section one provides the evaluator with essential contextual information, while section two allows informed error-analysis and further revision.""Shannon andWeaver's “transmission” model of the communication process has long been recognized as inadequate for describing the complex process of human communication except in the limited context of radio-telephone communication for which it was originally developed. In spite of numerous criticisms and attempts to postulate new models, none of the alternatives has been widely accepted. From a practical standpoint, the principal problem with Shannon and Weaver's model is that it evaluates communication based on the efficiency of the channel. In an effort to account for more of the components of the communication processes, subsequent researchers focused attention on the components of the communication process, communication reaction, and the semantic reaction. A new communication model incorporating both syntactic and semantic aspects of communication is required. © 1987, Sage Publications.

The first model, the vertical, involves functional specialization and the scientific examination of a specific discipline. The second model, the horizontal, stresses breadth rather than depth. This latter model examines what is often called the “softer” side of managenment—leadership, communica tion, entrepreneurship, and strategy. Awareness of these two models is important to all business communication faculty, especially to those housed in business schools. The model a school adopts can affect how the faculty member teaches the business communications course and will strongly in fluence the kind of research that faculty in business schools have to do to receive promo tion and tenure. Recent revisions of AACSB standards increase the likelihood of closer relations between business communications and business schools. All business communication faculty need to be aware of these models when designing courses, when developing research agendas, and especially when accepting a faculty position in a business school. © 1993, Sage Publications.

But now university teachers and students alike are realizing that systematic courses in such subjects can have considerable value to students while they are under graduates and later. The two newest universities, the University of Waikato at Hamilton and the University of Massey at Palmerston North, both have business communication courses which are fairly similar in prescription to those taught in North America. These are becoming soundly established. © 1981, Sage Publications.

The experiments were conducted at three nominal jet velocities (35, 48, and 63 m/s) and with solid loadings (weight of solid/weight of gas) ranging from 0 to 2. 75. The velocity profiles were integrated graphically, and gas entrainment into a jet was found to occur primarily at the base of the jet. The gas velocity profiles in the jet and the gas entrainment into the jet are reported.""Applying the communication theory called punctuated equilibrium to an activity system in the federal department that oversees health-information privacy reveals that the theory fails to align well with a government activity system rooted in a stable democratic tradition.

This study aims to investigate the role of plain language in the subversive text $\rm Ecodefense$, and consider some ethical implications of plain language by conducting a close textual analysis. Research questions: (1) Is the subversive text $\rm Ecodefense$ an artifact of plain language? (2) If $\rm Ecodefense$ is written in plain language, what does that suggest about the inherent ethicality of plain language? Literature review: Plain language refers to clear expression designed to help users achieve desired goals. In the sense that it is a communication practice, it is guided by standards put forth by various agencies and bureaucratic bodies. In the sense that it is a movement, plain language is characterized by the proliferation of organizations advocating for plain language practices in society. This study is rooted in the investigation of the ethical practices of social movements. It considers the ethics of plain language practices when they are put toward subversive ends and explores the ethical value of plain language itself. Methodology: $\rm Ecodefense$ is analyzed using the Center for Plain Language's (CPL) Plain Language checklist and Writemark's criteria for documents, which includes consideration of the audience, structure, language content, and design of a text, as well as usability testing. Results and conclusion: Analysis shows that $\rm Ecodefense$ is partially representative of plain language use and practice under the CPL's standards, and appears somewhat more fully representative under Writemark's standards, which are designed for use by a trained assessor. Analysis further suggests that adherence to checklist-driven language practices may unwittingly enable an ethic of exigence; thus, research is needed into the ethical implications for list-driven, or standards-based, rhetoric in order to ensure that plain language practices consider long-term implications for users and for organizations that employ these practices. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Subversive environmental texts, those that strive against hegemonic discourse, such as the book Ecodefense, have a long history of use by radical environmentalists as a means for recruitment and distribution of best practices.

The individual reports are typed and read into a word processing system through an optical character recognition device and telecommunicated to the central site where they are electronically combined into a departmental summary report. The second-level manager can then use a CRT for a final edit or send the document to word processing for additions or corrections. The biggest advantage of this process is that the second-level manager no longer has to wade through paper and cut and paste to prepare the monthly report. Minimal paper changes hands and there is no delay in delivery. Preliminary statistics on two pilot projects indicate an 85 percent decrease in report preparation time for management."The author contends that there is not enough time within the course of a business communication course to teach writing process. The author outlines the challenges of the course: business communication courses have more content to cover than freshman writing courses, classical process may be an illusion, and writing processes differ among students. The author differentiates between the nature of business communication, it's purpose, audience, medium, etc., and the nature of academic writing. The author argues that business communication needs to be timely, and this need for timeliness is served by the advent of the word processor, which makes the writing process more efficient and facilitates business communication needs. ""This article is based upon Forman's Outstanding Researcher Award keynote address at the 1996 meeting of the Association for Business Communication. Its purpose is twofold: to explore the potential of translation as a survival strategy that enables business communication specialists to continue practicing the discipline, and to consider translation as a powerful heuristic for posing new questions about the research agenda for business communication and, ultimately, about its disciplinary character. The term ""translation"" is used to refer to (1) metaphoric notions of translation considered as a wide-ranging enterprise involving movement between instruction and research in business communication, between discourses, or between disciplines and (2) translation studies, or complex ideas of translation drawn from histories, theories, and practices of literary translation. Several appeals are made to extend translation further into instruction and research as a way to create knowledge and to legitimize the discipline. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""The motivated sequence is a strategy which, by allowing the writer to organize ideas in a pattern corresponding to the stages inherent in the natural thought processes, can help improve technical communication. It is especially valuable in documents that are in intrinsic part of the decision making procedure, as in the case of the Environmental Impact Statement. This article explains the motivated sequence and, using the Environmental Impact Statement as an example, demonstrates how its use can improve technical communication.""The business communication instructor faces some serious motivational problems early each term. Students often are a little fearful of English or writing courses in general, but, worse, sometimes feel any such course is generally abstract, “artsy,” and worthless. We constructed the following handout to break down this resistance, and to show our students that our course is a practical preparation for their careers. This handout—which supplements a de tailed syllabus—not only introduces students to the course and its basic requirements, but also quotes practicing business managers on the real-world value of the skills the course teaches. © 1979, Sage Publications.

I don 't think I really believed that it was going to happen until I received the copy proofs. I remember a day some two years ago when a college friend and his wife paid Lenay and me a visit. They had not known that I was a published author; and when they spied my framed front page on an end table in the corner of our living room, they offered belated congratulations. I had the feeling that they were somewhat impressed and readily responded to all their questions. When asked how I felt about the article, I told them that next to marrying my wife it is the thing that I am most proud of in my short lifetime. Of course, our comtemplated arrival of children may push my article to third place, but still a proud third place. © 1981, Sage Publications.

The relationship between the supervisory use of ML, communication competence, communication satisfaction (CS), employees' job satisfaction, and perceived supervisory effectiveness was explored. The study was based on a sample of 136 participating employees surveyed via an interactive Internet survey of a 400-person organization. Suggestions for further research are presented. The identification of the specific relationship between the use of language and communication competence, CS, job satisfaction, and leaders' perceived effectiveness establishes a direct link between communication, leadership, and job satisfaction. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communication.""Traditional conceptualizations of leader-worker oral communication have been unidimensional among management theorists (Yukl, 1989). Despite urgings by academics and managers for more research, little investigation has been conducted into the specific roles that language plays in strategically transmitting leader behavior. In response, recent leadership theory has called for more sophisticated models to explain leader-worker communication processes, their relationships with desirable outcomes, and potential areas for improvement (Conger, 1991; Daft & Wiginton, 1979; Fairhurst & Chandler, 1989; Jablin, 1985; Jablin & Krone, 1994; Scandura & Graen, 1984; Sullivan, 1988; Waldron, 1991). The present study addresses this need in two ways: first by developing the motivating language scale, and then by testing it for reliability and validity. This scale is based on motivating language theory (MLT) (Sullivan, 1988), which proposes that strategic managerial application of all three speech acts will have a significant and positive effect on employee performance and process outcomes. Research implications and future directions are also discussed. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Advisors made substantive-type suggestions most frequently, but for the most part, reviews that received editing-related comments were not updated more often than were those with nonediting-related comments. Unlike professional editors, Advisors lack gatekeeping control that compels writers to revise their work, but as companies recognize the value of quality user-generated content, they may use amateur editors more often, perhaps in conjunction with professional technical editors. © 2014, SAGE Publications.

However, rather than turning to hackneyed arguments or to literary evidence, he can motivate students more effectively by turning to compelling testimonials from leaders in business and industry, to appropriate personal experiences, and to stimulating classroom strategies that emphasize the importance of language ability in career, social, and civic aspirations. The lively use of such readily available resources can improve student attitude toward the course and should thus improve student performance.""This study examines how instructors may motivate students to improve their writing skills. According to the motivation research in the psychology and management litera tures, two of the most prominent motivational techniques are goal setting and reinforce ment. We examine what these literatures suggest about the effective use of such motivation techniques, assess what has been done in business writing, compare goal- and punishment-based grading systems for students, and test two exemplary systems to determine their effect on students' performance and perception. Results of this study indicate that although both goals- and punishment-based grading systems improve students' writing, they are perceived differently and they influence students' writing in different ways. © 1993, Sage Publications.

Phases of the assignment dealt with preparing of a memo describing the problem or question, the writing of an investigative report, organizing feasibility studies, and choosing the right audiences. Some of the feasibility studies attacked problems concerning the university. Others concerned community problems and summer job experiences. Included in the assignment were videotaped oral presentations.""Empathy has long been recognized as a desirable characteristic for managers, counselors, and all who interact on a regular basis with others. Unlike previous studies, in which the relationship between individuals was con sidered the basis for empathy, this views the content of communication as the basis. Representatives of three occupational groups served as sub jects. The relationship between empathy level and occupation is analyzed as are the differences between empathy level and content as categorized into Herzberg's motivators and hygiene factors. © 1976, Sage Publications.

In this paper, we propose a novel computer software tool that can assist these people in the understanding and construction of technical papers, by automatically identifying the structure of writing in different fields and disciplines. The system is tested using research article abstracts and is shown to be a fast, accurate, and useful aid in the reading and writing process.""Studies in the rhetoric of science have tended to focus on classic scientific texts and on the history of drafts and the interaction surrounding them up until the moment when the drafts are accepted for publication by ajournai. Similarly, research on disasters resulting from failed communication has tended to focus on the history of drafts and the interaction surrounding them up until the moment of the disaster. The authors argue that overattention to the moment skews understanding of what makes scientific discourse successful and neglects other valuable sources of evidence. After reviewing the promises and limitations of studies from historical, observational, and text-analytic approaches, the authors call for studies of responses to research articles from disciplinary readers and argue for studies using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methodologies that will explore the real-time responses of readers to scientific texts, test the effects of rhetorical strategies on readers, and track the course of acceptance or rejection over time.""This article builds on scholarship in technical communication, medical rhetoric, and visual communication and represents a portion of a grounded study of one medical workplace setting's visualization practices.

For example, U.S. technical communication scholars are still grappling with the problems of using English in software internationalization and translating technical communication products across boundaries of national culture and language without privileging Western values and beliefs. The tendency is to assume American culture and American Standard English as the norm, and to identify cultural and linguistic differences as problems only when there is a communication failure or when non-native speakers of English translate product users' manuals and other documents for use by Americans. The article draws attention to the limitations of the current favored strategies for training native speakers in international audience analysis and calls for a revamping of the curriculum to allow for the integration of language-based methodologies. It suggests the incorporation of the World Englishes perspective into training programs to internationalize students' learning experiences.""This is a case history of how a publications organization purchased third-generation word-processing and photocomposition equipment to produce the technical reports, proposals, briefing charts, and brochures that they had been producing for many years with the most basic of word processors - typewriters with memory. Implementation of these advanced publication production capabilities was planned for two phases: Acquisition and implementation, in late 1982, of a publication production system capable of optical-character-recognition (OCR) page reading, text processing, and phototypesetting; Additions to this 'foundation' configuration over the next five years, as implementation is justified and technology is available, of such capabilities as text-processing work stations for editors, interactive graphics terminals for illustrators, text and illustration composition terminals, and automatic platemaking.""Argues that the move to single sourcing often requires changes within teams as new skills are introduced and members' roles shift Points out that while some changes may threaten the stability of the team, managers can anticipate and prevent problems""Describes how a knowledge-building community perspective can lead to a framework for designing an informational site* Provides one means of addressing challenges that arise in the design and development of informational Web sites""One measure of progress in the development of a discipline is the quantity and quality of research being conducted. This article assesses 1989 research in technical communication by reviewing the articles in its two major forums: the proceedings of the ITCC and the IPCC. The analysis indicates that systematic research in technical communication is still in a limited stage of development. As is typical of a developing field, most of the 318 articles are descriptive and training literature (How-To), ranging from retrospective, anecdotal evidence to quasi-empirical evidence. While such information is useful to conference goers, many authors could profit from a more theoretical approach. One major problem is the lack of a clear distinction between an illustrative case and a case study in the empirical sense. In the few articles presenting systematic research, the most frequently used methodology is survey/questionnaire. Problems include sample selection and generalizability. In several studies, however, surveys were just one of several tools in a qualitative approach. While some projects were carefully designed, overall, the quality of the methodology is uneven. A comparison of the areas being researched with those designated by technical communicators as needing research revealed that more research is needed in management. Also needed is more systematic research into visual aspects of technical communication. Recognition for good research, small grants for research expenses, increased collaboration between academia and industry, and workshops or presentations on methodology could strengthen the research needed if technical communication is to develop into a mature discipline. © 1990 IEEE""Scholars in business and technical communication have continuously made efforts to look for effective teaching approaches for cross-cultural business and technical communication; however, little research has been conducted to study the process by which students develop intercultural competence; fewer studies have been conducted to assess learners' needs for gaining intercultural competence in the globalization age. To assess students' level of intercultural competence and understand whether they are likely to change in response to teaching, I first introduce a two-part framework for teaching and learning intercultural business and technical communication: the DMIS model - Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity, and the related instrument to assess intercultural sensitivity - the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI). Then I report the results of using the framework to assess and develop students' intercultural competence, and conclude the study by emphasizing the significance of the current empirical research and discuss the framework's limitations. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""With the increasingly multicultural workforce, companies are implementing programs to address diversity. This paper suggests two avenues of guidance for organizations adopting a multicultural approach. First, businesses can profit from experiences in academia, where researchers have outlined areas of difficulty. For example, larger issues (ones that will surface in the workplace) revolving around sharing power and valuing difference have come to the fore-front of academic debate. The inclusion of the ""other"" goes beyond token representation and is more complex than assimilation, melting pot, and integration theories suggest. Second, industry's own team management theory, which dismantles hierarchical structures in favor of participatory ones, suggests ways of dissolving barriers and creating unity. Working together to reach a common goal underlies team management theory. Successful teams in industry support the fact that collective decision making is more productive than that of the individual. New workplace structures should focus not on individual change but on cooperation and team goals. Pedagogical methods of inclusivity and workplace teams can assist companies as they prepare for the increasingly diverse workforce. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Effective multi-language service literature depends on accurate conversion of thought and meaning-not direct translation of individual words. Such conversion is best accomplished by those who speak the customer's language as their native tongue and whose educational background encompasses the scope of the subject matter. In addition, the publication format, e. g. , parallel or sequential arrangements of translated units of text, may be usefully varied according to the information content. The result is a more direct and understandable communication between the manufacturer and the user of his product.""The multi-use concept involves reshaping existing technical material for a variety of audiences and applications including reports, brochures, conference papers, magazine articles, and seminars. Companies typically develop these forms independently, even when they cover the same subject. Multi-use elminates this duplication of effort by developing new forms from old. This represents a significant cost and time savings, a savings that can be increased if a technical writer, rather than an engineer or a scientist, performs the conversion. This article discusses multi-use, presents some guidelines for converting one form into another, and provides an example that illustrates how a document can be reshaped into a variety of forms for various purposes.""Grounded theory analysis was applied to qualitative interviews with 25 communication professionals concerning cultural influences on crisis. This approach yielded several findings. First, public relations practitioners had difficulties in defining multiculturalism, often equating cultural diversity with communicating with Latinos. Second, interviewees saw cultural differences as just one aspect of diversity, emphasizing that age, religion, and education differences also affect corporate discourse. Third, although professionals considered culture a key element of crisis management, they did not feel prepared to handle the challenges of a multicultural crisis, nor did they report that they used culturally adjusted crisis strategies often. By integrating cultural competence and crisis management frameworks, this study provides the foundation for an in-depth understanding of crises, where scholars and professionals can pair crisis strategies with audiences' cultural expectations. Training initiatives focused on increasing levels of cultural competence can make organizations and communication professionals ready to the challenges of a global market. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""As technical communication gains the technology to deliver dynamic custom documents, the importance of audience analysis increases. As a major factor in supporting dynamic adjustment of document content, the audience analysis must clearly capture the range of user goals and information needs in a flexible manner. Replacing a linear audience analysis model with a multidimensional model provides one method of achieving that flexibility. With a minimum of three separate dimensions to capture topic knowledge, detail required, and user cognitive ability, this model provides the writer a means of connecting content with information requirements and ensuring the dynamic document fits varying audience needs.""Computer-based instruction (CBI) using multimedia and hypermedia is a new approach to teaching that is becoming increasingly popular in academic and nonacademic settings. Because the technical communication profession has developed a disciplinary culture uniquely suited to evolve along with communication technology, technical communicators experienced in creating instructional materials for technical products are well-positioned to become effective designers of this innovative form of instruction. However, as designers, they must become proficient in the early design stages of audience analysis, goals analysis, and control analysis to master multimedia and hypermedia CBI. In this article, the authors review findings from several fields to help technical communication teachers and practitioners (a) explain the value of audience analysis, goals analysis, and control analysis; (b) accomplish those analyses effectively; (c) use the results of their analyses to create effective multimedia or hypermedia CBI; and (a) set priorities for further related research.""The two authors created a multimedia intercultural business communication program. Multimedia is an effective instructional tool because of its ability to capture the attention of the learner and offer interactivity so the learner con trols the learning process. An appeal is made to the learner's imagination. Two constraints are the computer requirements to operate it and the length of time required to learn a multimedia software design program. The course content is described and the seven steps in developing the multimedia hypertext are detailed. The authors recommend the process with advice about what charac teristics the authors of multimedia programs need to develop. © 1997, Sage Publications.

Because copyright guidelines affecting multimedia production have only recently been established, policies are not well known. To determine if ABC members understand the guidelines, we created a questionnaire about specific instances of multimedia use and sent it via Internet e-mail to a sample chosen from the 1996 membership directory. Respondents received an average grade of ""C,"" with most answering conservatively, assuming that copyright restrictions are more restrictive than they, in fact, are.""This paper presents a longitudinal case study of the introduction of voice mail, applying media richness theory to develop and assess a set of 16 tasks with varying levels of equivocality, and to compare different media. Through t-tests, reliability, factor, and multidimensional scaling analyses, evaluation of task equivocality and voice mail is discussed and potential shortcomings of current approaches are highlighted. Results show that equivocality does not seem to be unidimensional and includes aspects of authority across organizational boundaries. Across all tasks, telephone would be most likely selected by respondents, but face-to-face and telephone were more likely to be selected for more equivocal tasks. Unlike in prior studies, voice mail is perceived as similar to documents and face-to-face. © 1994 IEEE"The Multimodal approach offers technical communicators and science writers an analytical tool to synthesize the meaning made in the connections across communicative modes. This multimodal synthesis can help technical communicators better exploit the meaning-making potential of multimodal combinations and understand the needs of future generations shaped by their increasingly developed multimodal literacy."The authors provide a robust framework for using rhetorical foundations to teach multimodality in technical communication, describing a pedagogical approach wherein students consider the rhetorical canons-invention, arrangement, style, delivery, and memory-when developing texts beyond print. Students learn to assess their own work, reflecting on how each canon contributed to the rhetorical effectiveness of their multimodal projects. The authors argue for using the canons as a rhetorical foundation for helping students understand technical communication in the digital age.

We argue that, from both ethical and pragmatic perspectives, US businesses should reject the voluntary, self-certifying approach to data protection currently in favor in the United States. US businesses should advocate instead for a European approach that mandates stronger data protection and establishes a government agency charged with enforcing it. If the US adopted a European approach to data privacy, US businesses would attract more customers and avoid the legal problems that are likely to result when European and Canadian data-privacy authorities begin to enforce their new laws vigorously.""Professional communicators often rewrite exten- sively; consequently writers should realize that earlier, “rough” drafts of a document can be obtained by an opposing party and used against the writers and their companies in litigation. Specifically, almost any of a company’s records can be obtained during pretrial discovery, including early drafts, and most business records (early drafts included) are admissible evidence. Multiple drafts could particularly serve as important evidence in three types of cases: those concerned with determining intent, those arising out of bargained-for obligations, and those litigating defective product designs. Writers should not be discouraged from keeping written records, however, since careful writing and record keeping can actually provide a protective record for a company if it is sued. © 1992 IEEE""This article uses data obtained from a 2-year study-observation, survey, written- and verbal-artifact analysis, and interviews-of an interdisciplinary organization of pain management professionals to illustrate the analytic advantages of Mol and Latour's multiple-ontologies theories over incommensurability theory in understanding interdisciplinary practice. We demonstrate that pain science and medicine encompass a variety of practices that transcend disciplinary boundaries in ways not accounted for with incommensurability theory. After explicating multiple ontology theory and illustrating its analytic potential, we conclude by recommending a postplural model for inquiry into rhetoric of science. © 2013 Copyright Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Teaching communication to MBAs often involves focusing on corporate strategic discourse when student projects are intended to help companies move to a more advanced stage of development. This focus on corporate strategy—the language and concepts that concern the mission and direction that an organization should adopt—requires, in turn, that faculty enact several roles to assist students in developing their final assignments, strategic presentations, and reports. Faculty play the role of specialists in corporate strategy, communication specialists, and stand-ins for the primary audience(s) for these assignments. Working with students on these assignments underscores two important values in MBA education: providing students with the means to engage in discussion at the CEO level where decisions about the company’s strategic direction are made, and demonstrating to students that the strategic assignments they produce belong to a larger communication campaign for getting buy-in for corporate strategy. These teaching practices foster research projects as well. © 2004, Sage Publications.

Economics favors the computer only if multiple use can be made of the material after it has been captured in machine-readable form. Such is the case with the material that is keyboarded into the bibliographic database of the American Institute of Physics (AIP). The records in this database are produced directly from the manuscripts submitted by authors and are then used over and over again. The multiple-use concept cannot be used to justify computer typesetting of the full text of journal articles. The paper describes such multiple use applications at AIP, and discusses the conditions that must be met before full-text computer composition can become competitive with other methods.""This article reports an investigation of the technical and economic aspects of the multiple use of bibliographic data and abstracts of articles in machine readable format. Various techniques such as OCR, word processing, and phtocomposition are available for data acquisition and transmission. There is also sufficient economic justification to encourage sharing of such data among publishers. But questions of cost sharing, standards, copyright, and procedural adjustments in management and accounting are powerful deterrents to the multiple use of publication data both within an organization and among different publishing concerns. The advantages of sharing bibliographic data can be achieved only if publishing concerns in both the public and private sectors are willing to cooperate and adjust.""The paper analyzes the characteristics of the multiple-image technique of audiovisual communication and emphasizes its advantages over the more usual sequential presentation of supporting visual images. The features of the multiple-image technique are assessed and the production techniques peculiar to the method are examined. Audience reaction to this type of presentation is then considered. Evidence is presented to support the premise that this technique offers exciting potential for the presentation of technical papers, an area of communication which has received little attention for much too long a time.""This article sketches the significance of aurality in hypermedia, notes that the field of English studies is constructing the World Wide Web as a verbal and visual medium, and proposes a transtextual framework to aid technical communicators in designing musical hypermedia. Because the study of music on the World Wide Web is nascent, this article includes references to art and film music, whose theories and practices are substantially developed. © 2009 Taylor & Francis."Investigates how individuals from different cultures perceive questioning and pausing/interrupting behavior.

Financial analysts and many scholars have judged these reports on their clarity, accuracy, and honesty. Because the narrative invites interpretations, such criteria are not sufficient, and additional standards need to be constructed. A semiological analysis of the textual and visual elements allows for the discovery of the techniques used by document designers to promote their companies' values. Artistic images may encourage positive readings of annual reports, which, combined with similar messages in other media and repeated over time, invoke cultural myths. By definition, myths are broadly accepted commonplaces that conceal details of their subject, and communicators must expose the missing details and judge the myths within a specific context. This kind of analysis, acknowledging the constraints of the rhetorical situation of a single report, can identify effective criteria for judging the narrative's ethics.""This article explores how rhetorical myth can be used as a tool for persuading employees to accept change and to maintain consensus during the process. It defines rhetorical myth using three concepts: chronographia (a rhetorical interpretation of history), epideictic prediction (defining a present action by assigning praise and blame to both past and future), and communal markers (using Burkean identification and rhetorically defined boundary objects to define a community). The article reports on a 3-year ethnographic study that documents the development of a rhetorical myth at Iowa State University’s Printing Services department as it underwent changes to its central software systeme. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""Twenty-two myths about writing are presented and compared with reality; recognition of the myth may prevent falling victim to it. The myths are grouped into the nature of writing, how writing is learned, and how writing is practiced; one myth concerns who is able to teach writing. Among the realities seldom expressed are that 'thought comes with writing' and 'one learns to write by reading. ' Also, writing need not be easy, silent, solitary, or tidy work. Better recognized is that 'writing generally requires many drafts and revisions' to satisfy the author.""Technical and scientific terms originate from many different sources. Among the most common are foreign language root words, names of originators, inventors and discoverers, names of common shapes, names of functions, acronyms, arbitrary labels, anonymous folk coinages and labels given by advertisers and public relations people. Numerous examples can be found of each of these. The usefulness and viability of technical and scientific terms is dependent upon the amount and kind of information contained within the term itself and the suitability of that information for the situation in which the term is used. The usefulness and viability of such terms is also dependent upon the terms' mnemonic qualities and upon their having the right ring or onomatopoeia. Although such effects are not entirely predictable or controllable, attention to them can nonetheless lead to more effective naming in science and technology.""Although narration has been recognized as a complex mode of discourse, its role in professional communication has not been widely studied. This article examines narration in one form of professional communication—direct solicitations—and links narration to an important research issue: the social construction of knowledge, or the social justification of belief, through language. The direct solicitations are described, and the role of narration in justifying belief socially, for direct solicitations, is then discussed by examining narration and analysis as two means for organizing and expressing experience. The interweaving of these two means in direct solicitations is illustrated, but finally the importance of the narrational over the analytic in giving shape and significance to experience is asserted. Thus, the central role narratives play in justifying belief socially, for direct solicitations is described. Three sample narratives from three direct solicitations illustrate this discussion. © 1992, (publisher).

In contrast, narration is widely devalued among teachers and researchers of technical communication. This devaluation is unwarranted in light of the complexity, pervasiveness, and potential power of narration in technical communication. Research into narration as a focal topic may facilitate a fuller, more conscious exploitation of the narrative mode. © 1988, Sage Publications.

It addresses the move in many fields to reconceptualize research as narrative. Placing narrative within a postmodernist frame, it examines the centrality of ethnography within a postmodernist view. The importance of ethnography in research is related to two key narrative questions that ethnographic theorists in other disciplines are addressing: Who is telling the ethnographic story? For what purposes is the story told? This article supports the importance of taking a critical stance toward these questions and discusses the implications of postmodernist ethnographic theory for research in professional communication.""An analysis of the language used by a management team suggests that narrative discourse helped resolve conflict, influence corporate decisions, and unify the group. By collectively constructing stories, managers made sense of the past, coped with the present, and planned for the future. Managers' preference for narrative reasoning reflected their beliefs that narrative conveyed contextual complexities and helped interpret other types of evidence, such as statistics. Lack of trust between the management team and corporate headquarters derived at least partially from different beliefs about what makes stories believable. Through individual and collective narration, managers used imagination to transform experience and knowledge into influence and action. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""Human-centered design is a burgeoning field of study that has the potential to work toward actively creating more just and equitable technology design while critically interrogating the design process. To do this, human-centered design needs to consider making social justice aims a primary objective and end-goal in design. One way of integrating social justice aims into design is to employ the use of narrative inquiry. This article explores an alternative method for developing design scenarios using narrative inquiry and the feminist concepts of silence and voice as a way to promote considerations of social justice and inclusion in design. Using narrative inquiry to rethink certain aspects of the design process can help designers address issues of agency. The methodological focus of this article responds to Suchman's call for ""alternative visions"" of how technology production and design can be undertaken. © The Author(s) 2016.""Narrative has been neglected in the education of professionals. The persuasive power of narrative is essential to all the sense-making activities that govern the lives of professionals, for in sense making, they are regularly using narrative. The central example here is the O. J. Simpson legal defense that was organized within the narrative frame of Simpson's story.The authors compare his story with a famous Norwegian folktale to illustrate the role narratives play in amplifying the values of a community. Using Propp's structural analysis of the folktale, they deconstruct the Simpson trial, which reveals implications of the narrative paradigm for the professional.""The National Commission on Libraries and Information Science appointed a task force in late 1975 to prepare a plan for a National Periodicals System, which was completed in early 1977. Recommendations specify a three-level structure for the national program. At the first level, access to periodicals will be provided by local, state, and regional library systems. The major new element recommended is a comprehensive periodicals collection - National Periodicals Center - which will operate as the second level and meet the majority of unfulfilled requests from the first level. At a third level, existing national libraries and other unique research collections will serve as backup to the other service levels.""We assert that schools and textbook publishers ineffectively emphasize gram mar. To see if traditional instruction in grammar prepares students for busi ness communication classes and the corporate world, we investigated specific writing skills of both native and nonnative business students. Although most students passed objective grammar and punctuation tests—the two groups showed no statistical differences—some cannot write. High schools, the study found, pass these students. The university also passes writing-deficient stu dents on to employers who must train them. We searched for reasonable solu tions to reduce the number of graduates who lack English skills for the workplace. © 1996, Sage Publications.

But these technical persons are trained largely in academic problems and treatments, which are shown to differ profoundly from their professional couterparts. For engineering students are traditionally trained in a discipline dissociated from a professional base at its very origins, enrolled in a science-oriented curriculum, and taught by technical instructors lacking professional experience. Rhetoric instructors should not, therefore, consider engineering students experts in the articulation and treatment of typical problems addressed by professionals. This paper describes representative student difficulties in the selection and treatment of technical problems in simulated professional reports. Based on results obtained with questionnaires and in-depth interviews, these difficulties are traced to the use of academic materials as sources. Representative case histories are used to illustrate typical student pitfalls in adapting academic source materials. Pedagogical suggestions are offered.""Employees often perceive periods of change—no matter how warranted or beneficial—as crises, exhibiting both cognitive and emotional reactions including feelings of insecurity and uncertainty, even fear, chaos, stress, betrayal, grief, and anger. Management must have a clear strategy for communicating with employees through change, as employee expectations for open and honest communication are increased in times of shift and uncertainty. Open, honest, and regular communication is essential to keeping employees motivated and productive. Benefits of effective communication in times of change include higher employee satisfaction and engagement, lower turnover, and stronger long-term commitment. Solid internal relationships also strengthen ethics-related outcomes such as fraud reduction and reputation management © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""Many business communication teachers are grappling with ways to use the rich potential of the WorldWide Web. A categorization or typology of sites provides students with a tool to explore the Web systematically and attentively. The typology discussed in this article divides corporate sites into five cate gories depending on purpose: marketplace awareness and promotion, cus tomer support, sales, advertising, and electronic information services. Armed with this typology, students analyze sites as examples of business communica tion. Based on this analysis, they develop a collaborative oral presentation. © 1998, Sage Publications.

Any course in technical editing should cover these five distinct areas. Language studies in technical editing require a special emphasis in proofreading and technical abridgment. The study of formats goes beyond rote memorization. Technical editing students study the logic behind established formats and learn how to improve them and develop new ones. The production and editing of graphics require artistic - and even theatrical - judgments. And the planning, preparation, and printing of newsletters, journals, and books require a special combination of verbal, visual and manual skills.""Technical communication is not one discipline but three, each addressing its own distinctive set of problems and applying its own particular criteria when deciding which of the alternative solutions it has generated addresses its problems most effectively. Of the three, only the professional discipline is conducting its research satisfactorily; the teaching and theoretical disciplines are not. All three could improve their research activities by posing themselves a wider variety of significant problems, generating a richer array of alternative solutions, and conducting more carefully the activities that enable them to select the alternatives most worthy of continued attention and use.""This article looks at the types of research needed in business writing. Research in business is referred to as looking at documents, adding up the results of a questionnaire or combining replies to interviews. Libraries play a big role in efforts to locate documents related to business writing. Contributions to research in communication networks made by Arthur Cohen of the Case Institute are mentioned. Cohen has concluded that a given network fosters a certain pattern of communication. The author references three dissertations which deal with the problem of the leader in relation to communication. One of the papers discusses the link between verbal ability and accuracy in predicting the behavior of individuals in leaderless group discussions.""Although technical documents have an ancient history as a genre,the profession of technical communication is relatively new. Since its inception in the 1940s and ’50s, it has grown significantly in North America and western Europe, but it has only begun to make inroads in Asia and eastern Europe in the past two decades. As we recognize that our profession is becoming global not only in terms of the audiences it serves but also in terms of those who practice it, we should likewise acknowledge that our discipline’s research base is no longer adequate. We need to revisit our assumptions and question whether they are sufficient to serve us and the people with whom we communicate today and in the future. To do that, we need to investigate how such factors as audience, purpose, rhetorical patterns, and document design in the rest of the world differ from what we are accustomed to.""This address was an introductory talk at the ABCA National Convention at the Sheraton Hotel in Philadelphia, December 28, 1973. © 1974, Sage Publications.

This article, which focuses on the first of these two steps, outlines three categories of data that are important to communication system design and proposes a system for gathering and correlating the data in these three categories. The tangible product of this gathering and correlating is a three-dimensional needs assessment matrix, which is used as part of the input for the actual design of the communication system. A later article will deal with the communication system design itself.""Research on ethnic Chinese students studying in a Western (New Zealand) learning environment exposed differences in communication and learning between their first culture and the host culture. Thirteen ethnic Chinese students in a New Zealand university business school participated in an 18-month ethnographic study. The findings indicate that these students were not prepared for the dialogic nature of classroom communication, which created difficulties in listening, understanding, and interacting. Written assignments embodied different expectations of writing styles, and understandings of critical analysis and plagiarism. The findings raise challenges for teachers in responding to difference rather than deficit approaches to teaching and learning, for ethnic Chinese students to be better prepared for the new learning environment, and for host institutions and local students to find ways of developing diversity awareness and appreciation. © 2004, Sage Publications.

Consequentially, much effort in university classrooms is spent on focusing on the differences between groups and on finding ways to ""manage"" cultural diversity. What is often missed is the common ground among cultural groups and the differences within what are presumed to be homogenous groups of students. To negotiate this complexity of diversity, we describe an initiative to foster collaborative student-led analyses of a case study to open up meaningful discussions around diversity. © The Author(s) 2014.""This article builds on Sacks' Membership Inference-rich Representative (MIR) device in exploring how interviewers and interviewees negotiate professional membership. The data for the research include the transcripts of authentic interviews between 6 interviewers working for a Chinese English-medium media institution and 11 interviewees, the interviewers' notes, and the recruitment results (9 successful ones and 2 unsuccessful ones). The analysis indicates that the Chinese media institution as a community of practice has its membership categories and inference-rich information relevant to the categories. The MIR device was used by the interviewers and the interviewees in their interactions with the successful interviewees orientating to or negotiating the target membership category of Chinese journalists by brokering boundary objects such as the inference-rich information relevant to the target membership category. The notion of membership contextualization cues is proposed by drawing on Gumperz's contextualization cues and Sacks' membership categorization device and applied in the interpretation of the findings. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study analyzes the discourse during a meeting of three diverse organizations as they attempt to resolve conflicting organizational interests. The three diverse groups were a waste disposal business, a grassroots community organization, and a state regulatory agency. Discourse analysis of a meeting among these three organizations supported negotiated order theory, which suggests organizations with different cultures find it difficult to achieve a negotiated order because they will at times fail to share the symbolic meaning of the common terms they use. Implications for practice and future research are offered. © 2003 by the Association for Business Communication.""To examine the elements of professional consciousness in technical communication to facilitate the growth of professional identity. Method: To develop a structured collaboration model based on Wenger's three dimensions for establishing a community of practice: joint enterprise, mutual engagement, and shared repertoire. Results: Structured collaboration shows strong potential to nurture a community in which the specific professional identity of being an academic or a practitioner is minimized in favor of the negotiated identity of being a community member working toward mutual goals. Conclusions: Effective collaboration between the academic and practitioner communities creates a negotiated professionalism through better research, better education, and a more comprehensive body of knowledge. Structured collaboration along the lines of community of practice can be used to encourage professional consciousness, which can lead to professional status.""To examine the elements of professional consciousness in technical communication to facilitate the growth of professional identity.

However, his theory can also be a useful rhetorical model to explain hypertext as a language event that relies on nested dialogues of visible text and invisible scripting. Moreover, Burke's belief that the purpose of discourse is to share knowledge with others provides a striking parallel to Vannevar Bush's original theory about hypertext. Even Burke's metaphor of a drama fits the purpose and process of hypertext. © 1994 IEEE""Network analysis is one of the instruments in the communication audit toolbox to diagnose communication problems within organizations. To explore its contribution to a communication audit, the authors conducted a network analysis within three secondary schools, comparing its results with those of two other instruments: interviews focusing on critical incidents and a communication satisfaction questionnaire. The results show that network analysis may complement interview and survey data in several ways, by uncovering unique problems or by explaining or corroborating problems that were uncovered by the critical incidents or the survey. The results also show that additional data are sometimes needed to make sense of network characteristics. © The Author(s) 2014.""This paper analyzes the relationship between performance and social networks across a sample of 14 protestant churches.

Particularly, the development of local, national, and international computer networks has created a collaborative writing environment. At the heart of the Internet network is the UNIX operating system. The open architecture of UNIX makes it a superior tool for collaborative writing, in the classroom, across the campus, or internationally. Central to the open system is UNIX's mode of allowing users to set file access permissions, restricting some files while allowing others to be open to the public. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Its introduction is increasingly discussed in businesses, universities, and government agencies, and various experiments have been tried. The time is rapidly approaching when this new medium will focus efforts on a larger scale designed to insure its successful implantation as a standard communications technology. At that time, it will be essential to obtain not only satisfactory hardware and software, but also knowledge of the social practices associated with the successful application of the technology. The author offers a brief summary of the essential aspects of network design and conference moderating in anticipation of that need.""This article argues for a rhetoric of networked exchanges that focuses on the response. Working from Spinuzzi's call for a rhetoric of horizontal learning, it examines two kinds of online writing spaces in order to propose such a rhetoric. After surveying conflicting, academic attitudes regarding networked exchanges, the article proposes the response as a type of professional communication. A specific message board thread and a series of blog carnivals serve as examples of the rhetoric of response, a way that horizontal learning produces a specific type of networked writing identity. The article concludes with a call for response-based communication practices. © 2009 Sage Publications.""Technical communication scholars have shifted to considering the role of communication specialists as knowledge workers within larger networks, such as work groups, organizations, and institutions. From our interest in this trend as well as our aims to bridge workplace and classroom contexts, we conducted a case study of the networked interactions of key actors involved in iFixit’s Technical Writing Project, as enacted in a technical writing classroom at a state university.Method: From Latour’s definition of an actor as a component of a network capable of impacting other components, we conducted a qualitative case study examining the interactions of technical writers, technical writing students, technological devices, tools, and wiki technologies during students’ completion of the Technical Writing Project. In particular, we examined how these actors exerted rhetorical impacts on one other during students’ writing processes.Results: The results of our study were that the Technical Writing Project asked students to assemble a complex rhetorical situation that involved technical knowledge-making as well as assembling both human and nonhuman actors to create high-quality documentation. Further, this documentation was created in a situation strongly influenced by both workplace realities and the interactions enabled by an open source wiki that allows for contributions by interested Internet users.Conclusion: We believe our study on the reciprocal impacts of both human and nonhuman actors in the context of a learning project that spans workplace and classroom context calls for new models of rhetoric that better account for networked knowledge-making. © 2014, Technical Communication.

From these statistics and stories, we already know that independent technical communicators face challenges ranging from legal issues to establishing marketing visibility when they start and maintain businesses. Drawing on thick qualitative description from semistructured interviews, this article responds to the need for more systematic research tracing the networking practices, technologies, and relationships that enable entrepreneurial work. Research question: How do established individual entrepreneurs in TC describe the social relationships, networking practices, and networking technologies that shape their careers over time? Literature review: This project extends prior research at the intersections of entrepreneurship, technical communication, and social networks. Entrepreneurial studies research indicates that strong social ties and embeddedness influence venture performance; however, systematic scholarship on the networks or networking practices of independent or entrepreneurial technical communication practice has been limited. Methodology: The project used semistructured interviews to analyze the professional communication practices of eight technical communicators with considerable experience working independently as consultants or small-business owners. We used an online search to identify experienced entrepreneurs in the interdisciplinary field of technical communication. After recruiting participants via email, we conducted semistructured interviews to gather employment narratives, while prompting participants to share information about career-relevant ties, networking practices, and networking technologies. We then analyzed data through two iterative qualitative coding passes. Results and conclusions: Our participants, made up of experienced TC entrepreneurs, have used networking over at least two decades to advance personal business outcomes and evolve technical communication as a field and profession. Findings detail how networking is central to professional social knowledge construction, as TC entrepreneurs establish transactional contact with others, practice learning, and enact exponential reputation-building that addresses the isolation of working outside traditional organizations. Since this is a qualitative study based on self-report, the results are not generalizable but provide a foundation for future larger-scale research building from these qualitative themes. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""As more women reach middle and top level management positions in organizations, they have begun to recognize the importance of professional contacts. This study examines a professional womens’ network in order to identify types of communication behavior exhibited by network members and psychological gender types of active networkers. The Spence and Helmrick androngy scale was administered to identify high masculine, high feminine, and high androgynous network members. A survey instrument assessed the type and amount of networking behavior exhibited. High mas culine individuals indicated most often that they were making contacts outside their professional network and androgynous individuals indicated they were making more frequent contacts per week than other psychologi cal types. © 1983, Sage Publications.

He must provide a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio for his readers by controlling semantic noise as well as mechanical noise. He must anticipate that psychological noise will arise if he does not eliminate ambiguity, vagueness, and outright meaningless phraseology. He must resist the temptation to sound ″professional″ and concentrate on satisfying his readers' needs.""Just as the challenge in a global economy is to develop new frameworks and then communicate them effectively, our challenge is to prepare students for negotiating wholly new communication challenges. Communication is much more than expressing the content of other ""real"" business disciplines clearly. Language and image have become a crucial part of creating and managing contemporary corporate culture; thus, we must expand the teaching of managerial communication to include corporate communication. To describe ""communication,"" we must also employ words such as ""critical thinking"" and ""flexibility.""

The effect has been so strong - particularly in North America - that the word ″technical″ in technical writer, technical writing, and technical reports has literally become almost meaningless. This article discusses a few important differences between technical and nontechnical writing. It also explains some shortcomings of the traditional instruction and suggests methods of improvement.""Criteria are established that can be used to evaluate any book that promises to explain how one should go about writing documentation. Eight new books on the topic of computer user documentation were published in late 1984 and the first half of 1985. Only those new books that are either better than the books that have appeared previously or that offer something new and important are recommended. Comparing these books, the author considers the qualities that would constitute a perfect book on computer user documentation and judges which of those available come closest to the mark.""This article reports on a study performed for AARP on the needs of older Web users. It defines a model of older users that includes four dimensions (age, ability, aptitude, and attitude).

Provide a set of best practices for creating and delivering video based on analysis of existing, highlyrated content on YouTube. Method: Assessment of a criterion-based (that is, software type) sample of 46 instructional videos stratified by user ratings. Inductive coding of shared withingroup (that is, ""good,"" ""average,"" ""poor"" rating) features, including genre conventions, rhetorical work, and communication design qualities. Results: Good instructional videos share qualities that appear to account for their strong user ratings and distinguish them from average and poor videos. Good videos spend significant time introducing an instructional agenda and forecasting goals and steps. In this manner, they function like video equivalents of printed documentation. Good videos also focus on demonstrative content, in which steps are both performed and explained or elaborated. By contrast, videos with lower ratings focus as much or more on simply doing the steps without explaining or explaining without doing. Good videos were also designed so that their instructional messages could be easily identified and accessed, easily understood and applied, and so that the messages were engaging and encouraging. Conclusions: Designers of instructional video can successfully apply lessons learned from the design of instructional content for print while taking into account the medium-specific affordances and constraints of video and sound. The potential for rapid, viral distribution via social media channels should also inform the selection and design of instructional content.""The increasing availability of recording technologies makes it easier to include usability testing projects in business communication courses. Usability testing is a method of discovering whether people can navigate, read, and understand a print or electronic communication well enough to achieve a particular purpose in a reasonable time frame.

This paper addresses problems faced by the military when there is a mismatch between the reading ability of servicemen and the readability of technical manuals, discusses basic provisions of the new readability requirements, explains the rationale behind the new criteria, and concludes with a discussion of some ramifications that the new requirements may have for manual suppliers. Basically, the new specification provides that technical manuals shall be written at or below a particular reading grade level established by the procuring activity. Each manual will be written at a reading grade level that is appropriate for the actual intended users. This means, of course, that the grade levels established will vary from manual to manual. Contractors will apply a readability formula, the Recalculated Flesch formula, to determine if the required reading grade level has been attained. The formula is: GRADE LEVEL equals 0. 39 (avg. words/sentence) plus 11. 8 (avg. syllables/word) minus 15. 59.""As questions of public policy become more involved with the uses of scientific and technological knowledge, the public must increasingly rely upon interpreters of that knowledge to be able to form and express valid opinions. Here is a new and important role for the technical writer. The President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island stated that the most serious effect of that accident was severe mental stress. The stress was caused by incompetent reporting by people who lacked the necessary scientific and technological knowledge, or by people who possessed that knowledge but who were unable to express it in terms that lay people could understand.""Computer aids to text processing have become more available, ranging from stand-alone, office-type word-processing devices to large-scale, multiterminal, computer-based systems. Such systems encompass all phases of the text-handling cycle, from text entry, editing, revision, and updating through composition and printout. To help the technical author in the aerospace field become more familiar with the options open to him in automated publishing, the Technical Information Panel (TIP) of NATO's Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development (AGARD) sponsored a survey of computer-assisted word-processing and text-handling devices. This article is a summary of that study.""Although the U.S. workforce is becoming increasingly multicultural, research and theory in business communication continues to be based on the assumption of cultural similarity. This paper develops a framework for understanding multicultural communication in organizations that is based on the assumption of cultural difference. The framework comprises two steps, resistance to privileged discourse followed by the creation of harmonic discourse. The author suggests four directions for future research in multicultural communication in organizations: (a) documentation of different or ganizational discourses, (b) documentation and analysis of privileged organizational discourse, (c) documentation and analysis of organizational discourse in which privilege is resisted, and (d) documentation and analysis of multicultural organization al discourse. © 1991, Sage Publications.

A brief description is given of this category of papers and some general recommendations are made about their presentation. The inclusion of such information in primary journals should preferably remain limited in order not to affect the character of these journals.""The roles and importance of sentence-coupling conjunctions in general technical writing are analyzed. Based on a previous paper (which explained the meanings of these coupling words), this paper examines ways of improving logical argument, of providing continuity of thought between sentences, and of improving readability. Useful redundancy and punctuation are also briefly discussed in relation to coupling words. Comparative tables of incidental couplers, determiners, and redundant couplers are provided as practical aids to the technical writer and editor.""Technical writers and editors assume that readers are generally helped when nominalizations and the weak verbs that accompany them are replaced with the verb form of the nominalization. The study discussed here tests that assumption. Specifically, the study assessed the effect of nominalizations, nominalization imageability, and idea importance on readers' recall of technical prose. The results indicate that denominalized text is most effective in helping native speakers focus on more important information. Yet for nonnative speakers, nominalized text may work quite well. Conclusions and recommendations for further study are offered.""This paper discusses the needs of the Russian academic and research community in non-commercial networking, as well as the technical base for it.

In particular, the context of global electronic commerce leads to an increasing use of email in negotiating deals, which to this point has been carried out almost exclusively via face-to-face (FTF) or other high-feedback media (e.g., telephone) but not of non-FTF media. This study, involving 20 participants, uses speech act theory and psycholinguistic analysis to explore the affects of culture on non-FTF communication.""This historical case study of a non-rule policy document (NPD) adopted by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management describes an emerging genre in environmental discourse. The NPD standardizes environmental public policy for land disposal of foundry sand, a solid waste. The collaborative writing process took six months with industry input, and the NPD was presented to two environmental boards. Two contrasts, in process and format, distinguish NPDs from rules. The NPD is an entirely new kind of writing which includes guidance for implementing statutes. The writing process in the case involves government writers and industry representatives, although it does not include other public input such as public hearings. Instead, the staff of the pollution control agency simply presents the NPD to the appropriate environmental policy boards and arranges for its publication. This article adds to the body of knowledge about technical writing in government, specifically environmental policy and non-academic genres.""Nonprofit organizations have long used the personal experience narratives of clients, staff, and stakeholders in their communications. This study explores digital-age practices with this text form, analyzing 82 collections of digital personal experience narratives (DPENs) housed at or linked to Web sites of nonprofit organizations. Results are reported on the variety and frequency of the modes, featured constituencies, narrative perspectives, and digital interface features in the sample. Overall, the nonprofit DPEN collections sampled showed limited use of new digital production and distribution possibilities. Practice, however, differed notably between two segments of nonprofits: networks and service organizations. To explore these results, the article discusses key examples of DPEN collections from each segment. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""Linguistic sexism is being confronted with increasing awareness by people who recognize its political and social implications. There are viable alternative words and phrases that can be substituted for those that tend to misrepresent or stereotype either sex. This article points out where changes need to be initiated and offers reasonable substitute wording that does not become clumsy or ridiculous. Such usage is especially important in scientific and technical writing where objectivity, accuracy, and attention to detail are critical. References are included along with a supplementary reading list and an appendix that describes a genderist rating scheme for written and oral communication.""Maintains that Web designers should not rely exclusively on usability testing to provide design information, but should also examine how the sites invoke their audiences* Discusses rhetorical analysis and content analysis as alternative methods""Word processors with adjustable video screens are used to test students' writing facility with and without visual feedback. Lack of visual feedback seems to have a salutary effect in forcing concentration onto emerging thoughts rather than words and sentences. It also prevents interrupting the train of thought to edit and correct every few sentences. 'Local editing' is regarded as counter-productive because it deals with individual words and lines instead of reconceptualization and reorganization. For some students, however, the lack of feedback per se was disturbing and thought-disrupting.""The internationalization of ""technical help over the phone"" is tied to the increasing usage of a lingua franca facilitating the interaction between a call center agent and a caller who are both linguistically different. Researchers have noted that interactions between two parties who are nonnative users of the language employed for the encounter are peppered with understanding problems. This study looks into the causes of understanding problems in helpdesk encounters between nonnative speakers of English and the techniques those interacting parties used to resolve or prevent flaws in the conversation. Method: Conversation analysis was used to analyze 25 recorded phone calls, amounting to 750 minutes of data, made in a commercial call center and in the helpdesk of an international academic institute in Enschede, the Netherlands. Results: Analysis of the phone calls reveals that causes of understanding problems between an agent and a caller who are nonnative users of English go beyond asymmetries in their proficiency with the language. Factors such as incomplete information or erroneous inference from the utterance of the partner in the interaction are important triggers for the occurrence of understanding problems. Consequently, call center agents and callers use varied repair and preventative techniques to ensure that understanding problems will not impede the attainment of the primary goal of the encounter- to resolve the product-related problem of the caller. Conclusion: While understanding problems are inevitable in helpdesk encounters, especially those that involved nonnative users of the language employed for the interaction, such problems are hardly attributable to the linguistic differences characterizing interacting parties. It is apparent that helpdesk agents and callers are equipped with varied techniques to resolve understanding problems or to prevent their inception."Japanese rhetorical structure addresses an underlying communication goal that is very different from the goal of Aristotle's persuasive discourse. This fundamental difference in approaching the problem of writing often produces confusing results-as many who deal with Japanese-generated technical writing have experienced. © 1988 IEEE"This article presents the author's suggestions regarding the reasons why typical business communication courses minimize pedagogical developments in the writing process. First, many teachers may have been trained before the teaching of writing processes came into vogue. Second, there is difference among scholars as to what the writing process is. Finally, there may be some resistance among schools to teach process as opposed to product. The author feels, though, that these issues should be overcome.""Research in communication is continually underway in universities and colleges. This paper presents one project carried out in the stylistics of technical writing. A number of technical articles were examined; they ranged from report writing to professional and trade publications. The conclusions, while not definite, do shed some light on the difference between technical and nontechnical writing.""Communication researchers have helped frame understandings about disciplinary and professional writing. But often they are outsiders looking in. To complement that research, this study focuses on insider perspectives of engineers in academic and industrial contexts at diverse career stages. Qualitative data are analyzed using phenomenological research methods. Findings indicate that participant perspectives fall along a rhetorical awareness continuum at points spanning from denial and acknowledgment to an accentuation of rhetoric as critical to individual and organizational success. Participant perspectives along the continuum also vary in terms of writer and reader roles, writer identity, career stage/organizational role, and objectivity. Implications for practitioners are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.""This article identifies problems in the computer-supported group writing of MBA students who are both novice strategic report writers and novice users of technology that supports group work. These problems consist of lack of attention to readers’ needs, attitudes, and expectations; poor conflict management; leadership problems; genre confusion; shaky definition of the strategic problem; poor commitment and attitudes toward use of new technology; poor computer policies and practices; and conflicting hardware and software preferences. The article suggests several reasons for these problems, draws implications for instruction of computer-supported group writing, and suggests topics for further research. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

An observational study was carried out in a quasi-experimental setting in order to outline the behavior of users encountering and using an appliance for the first time. The purpose of this observation was to identify two kinds of factors: on the one hand, factors inciting the use of procedural documents accompanying appliances, and on the other hand, design features facilitating the use of these documents when looking for specific information. User behavior and strategies were categorized using two kinds of indicators: 1) the number of times the documents were examined prior to contact with the appliance and/or while carrying out the prescribed tasks; and 2) the total time required to locate information in three different kinds of documents: Text only, Picture only, Text + Picture. Results show that 16 participants out of 30 spontaneously used the procedural documents before starting to use the appliance. However, during the session, 27 participants consulted the documents at least once. This consultation was determined by the task to carry out and the complexity level of the task. Otherwise, results show that time taken to locate information was shortest when instructions were displayed in text-and-picture format.""This article explores the complexity in Rohan's observation that ""although texts in progress create community, this function hasn't value; in the world of business works in progress must be free"" [1, p. 130]. To do so, the article describes the history of the development of the paper sewing pattern, discusses the role personal communications with consumers played as the genre evolved, and offers observations on the kinds of instruction provided by sewing machine and pattern companies. The extent to which gender and authority are connected in communications between consumers and corporate authors is explored. The article concludes by observing that once a genre is sufficiently established to become a standard, two changes occur: industries adopt authority for only certain types of necessary information, and women's authorship becomes anonymous, corporate, and personal exchanges with consumers are curtailed to save the expense."This article presents a case study that examined how practices of visualization and text production converge in an experimental physics research setting. Findings suggest that visuals communicate meaning and become persuasive through their ability to index in different ways the technical dimensions of laboratory work.

By their very nature as training grounds, engineering classes establish a misleading context for writing. Through the writing done for these classes, students learn to ignore their readers, to misunderstand the purpose of the writing they will do on the job, and to misconstrue the crucial process of revising their texts. Nevertheless, despite the liabilities that may hamper their efforts to teach students about writing, professors of engineering must not abandon their efforts to encourage clear writing. Neither teachers of engineering nor teachers of writing can alone turn students into capable writers. Working together, however, they may succeed.""Traditionally, rhetorical skill resides in the speaker/sender. Rhetorical effectiveness—cogency, clarity, persuasiveness—is the product of the speaker’s resourcefulness in adapting to the setting and audience. In the current epoch, though, new technology has enabled the receiver to shape the message. Today, publishing technical information often consists in letting the receivers search the files, extract what they judge relevant, sequence and organize it any way they wish, and even print or display it to their own specifications. Often, today’s writer is NOT creating deliberately worded and presented messages but, rather, feeding molecular articles to “rhetorically neutral” databases, from which readers may extract what they wish. Such technologies as SGML even further limit writers, depriving them of such basic presentation devices as deciding where pages will begin and end.

Considerable scientific uncertainties and variable ranges allow authors to construct preferred versions of the story of atrazine. These incommensurate rhetorical constructions, more the result of competing economic and environmental interests than of any paradigmatic misalignments, have prolonged the dispute not only over atrazine's effects but also over whether its sales should be banned.

Such newly acquired information must be disseminated to many different groups of researchers who have many different interests and specific needs. Identifying existing markets for present information poses formidable problems for information scientists; anticipating future scientific breakthroughs and the potential impact thereof is an even greater challenge. On the one side of the scientific market exchange system, practitioners, researchers, and scholars seek information quickly and accurately and at a reasonable price. On the other side, a science of information systems has developed using new media, retrieval, and dissemination techniques with different cost/utilitystructures. This paper discusses a relatively inexpensive technique, citation indexing, which has the advantage of being adaptable to any scientific discipline wherein the scientific journal is a primary means of communication. Although citation indexes are incomplete at any given point in time, they are ″complete on the important issues″ and can be adapted to many different research and institutional management purposes.""Increasingly, technical communicators need to develop materials that meet the usability expectations of audiences in different nations and froMdifferent cultures. This article presents a researchapproachtechnical communicators can use to better understand and design materials for the different contexts in whichindividual in other nations use a given technology or communication product. Method: I review how an understanding of the context in whichindividuals use an iteM(i.e., context of use) affects what constitutes usability in a setting. I then review how script theory (froMcognitive psychology) and prototype theory (froMlinguistics) can be combined to create an effective method for identifying the variables affecting use in different cultural contexts. Results: A focused application of script theory can provide technical communicators witha framework for identifying the variables affecting usability in different cultural contexts. Suchidentification can be enhanced by a targeted application of prototype theory, and technical communicators can use a combination of script theory and prototype theory to develop communication products more attuned to different cultural contexts of use. Conclusion: When combined in a focused way, a script-prototype theory approachto researching the context of use in other cultures can help technical communicators better understand suchcontexts and design materials that better meet the expectations of users in other cultures. © 2017.

This simple observation that narrative and scientific texts are similar is not all that surprising when we recognize that scientific discourse, like all narratives, describes what happened and what it meant. Indeed, scientific texts are almost always accounts of scientists' experiences in reality.

One-and two-page résumé s for four fictitious, entry-level job candidates were created and grouped in six combinations using a split-split-plot design. Packets containing the different combinations of the four candidates' résumés (two one-page and two two-page résumés in each case) were mailed to 570 personnel recruiters from Big Six accounting firms (now the Big Five). Respondents were asked to read and rank the résumés as if they were those of real candidates for entry-level positions. Results indicate that recruiters ranked candidates with two-page résumés more favorably than candidates with one-page résumés, suggesting that graduating seniors with accounting majors and outstanding credentials should consider writing two-page résumés if they apply for entry-level Big Five accounting positions. The paper also argues for industry-specific empirical testing of recruiters' résumé preferences, with its own methodology offered as an example. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication."A method is proposed for keeping the information in a text processing system current.

There are, however, compelling reasons for editors to begin marking copy on the computer. In this article we consider online editing from the perspective both of editors and their employers. We then focus on one aspect of online editing: the mark-up models embodied in various editing tools. We demonstrate that the different mark-up models and their particular implementations have major implications for the editing process, including the quality of edited material and the worklife satisfaction of editors and writers. We conclude by recommending that the technical communication community exert its influence on software developers and corporate technology planners to encourage the development and adoption of online editing tools that will be congenial to editors. © 1995 IEEE.""This paper describes a study conducted at the IBM Canada Laboratory in Toronto. The study compared the usability of two versions of online help for an Application System/400∡ (AS/400∡) product. The long-term goal of our work is to develop empirically-based guidelines for writing online help, particularly for application enabling products. We used the following methodology: • We revised a portion of the online help text for one AS/400 product. The revised help included changes in the content, writing style, and presentation of the text. • The original version and the revised version of the help were compared in an interactive (online) task environment and in three hardcopy reviews. In the interactive environment, participants who used the revised version made 40 percent fewer help requests and viewed 45 percent fewer help screens than those who used the original version. There was no significant difference in task performance (quality of work) between those who used the original and the revised versions of the help. The results of the hardcopy reviews showed that participants strongly preferred the revised version. © 1989 IEEE""The author argues that online information must focus on traditional reader expectations in the creation of layout features for specific tasks. Typical screen limitations must also be considered in terms of the limits they impose on typical user interactions and navigation techniques. To address both these issues, screen geometries must be applied to functional designs. In addition, information developers need to consider the educational value in the computer's novel capabilities, such as sound, motion, and time.""Scenario-Based Task Help is a design approach for online task help that attempts to assist new users to accomplish useful work quickly, and to provide quick-reference task information for users familiar with a product.

Participants shopped for music CDs in a simulated internet mall featuring five virtual music stores with delay to in-stock feedback of 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 seconds. Preference was measured as the proportion of total purchases and shopping time allocated to each store. Consistent with previous research, a hyperbolic decay function provided the best fit to the data. The results further the consumer foraging model and bolster existing evidence of the generality of hyperbolic discounting and matching in human decision-making. © 2008 IEEE.""Building on the authors' prior studies that investigate uses and perceptions of online social networks, this study critically explores the emerging social networking culture. In doing so, the research seeks to identify possible constructs that can be used to predict social networking behavior that may then be tested in a future study. The study relies on multiple user perspectives, drawing its participants from international students at two universities, one in Australia and one in the United States. Throughout this process, the utility of using the lens of national culture versus using other lenses is also examined. While the qualitative data suggests somewhat divergent approaches to social networking in different countries, a number of common themes were also identified. Two themes which appeared across national boundaries were changes in use over time and privacy and trust. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""By offering open-source software (OSS)-based networks as an affordable technology alternative, we partnered with a nonprofit community organization.

The results show that approbation, or the use of praise to soften face threat, was the most effective facework message for the supervisor to use when providing negative feedback. When employees felt more threatened, they reported that they would be less likely to use voice to help others and more likely to use silence defensively as a response, but as their perceptions of threat decreased, they generally reported that they were more likely to use voice to help others.

It attacked the decision using copia and classification, rhetoric echoed by the Supreme Court and others in reversing the 1848 decision. The journal was particularly concerned with the case's implications for Morse's patent battles with Royal House and Alexander Bain. The articles offer an opportunity to examine the rhetoric of patent debates and differences in the rhetoric of professional and scientific journals without the emotional attachments of examining contemporary issues. © 2010 IEEE.""This article traces the reception of a “science comic book” by various audiences including readers and reviewers after publication as well as grant application review committees vetting the proposed project in its conceptual stage. Specifically, the work is a biology textbook containing comics-style visual explanations couched in the form of an imaginative story interwoven with and supplementing traditional text-based explanations of the same ideas. The analysis uses Genette’s concept of “paratexts” (i.e., a class of speech genres comprising those supplementary texts that contextualize and inform readers’ interpretations of the primary text that they accompany) to examine the rhetoric of the visual in the discourse of science education. This analysis observes that the stigmatization of comics as a medium played some role in how readers, critics, and reviewers responded to the text. The implications of this stigma for cultural conceptions of science and their relationships to other knowledge domains, including the arts and humanities, raise a concern for the mediation of public impressions of science as an institution. © 2017 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Instant messaging (IM) has the potential to be a powerful collaborative workplace communication tool. As this information and communication technology (ICT) becomes more diffused at work, it is important to consider how the workers will cope with yet another communication option. Using a cost-minimization perspective, this proposition-building piece links three types of costs associated with IM use, delay, access, and error, with two salient workplace concerns, productivity and communication overload. The delay costs associated with IM use are considerably lower than with other ICTs. While increased use of IM can enhance productivity, it might also lead to perceptions of overload. IM access costs include organizational access, interruptions, user experiences, user differences, and generational differences - variables that influence one another and can lead to either outcome. Error costs come in two forms: single-channel factors and message quality issues. These likely lead to increased communication overload and decreased productivity. Combining IM with other ICTs is a likely moderator in this relationship and might help overcome the single-channel factors. The resulting eight propositions and theoretical model provide a predictive framework to focus future workplace IM use studies. © 2008 IEEE.""Millennials, those individuals born between 1980 and 2000, compose the largest cohort of college students in the United States. Stereotypical views of millennials characterize them as technologically sophisticated multitaskers, capable of significant contributions to tomorrow's organizations, yet deficient in communication skills. This article offers insights for business educators to help millennials understand the influence of communication styles when optimizing communication effectiveness. Developing style-typing and style-flexing skills can serve as building blocks for millennials' subsequent interpersonal skill development in key areas such as audience analysis, active listening, conflict management and negotiation, and effective team building. An in-class exercise highlighting communication style-typing and style-flexing is included. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication."This article investigates the status of orality in the history of technical communication. The article calls for orality as an integral part and driving force of technical writing. The article brings to light the misconceptions that have led to a diminished role of oral communication in technical writing. The article shows the implications of oral skills for improved effectiveness of technical communicators. The article outlines the challenges and promises of teaching oral communication in technical writing."Forty-eight textbooks used in business communication courses over the past 24 years were examined in an effort to determine whether they (1) were essentially different from textbooks used in speech communication courses, (2) showed a trend across the years to move from primarily written to primarily spoken communication as the central thrust of study, and (3) offered training designed to meet the needs of business and professional persons, as identified by Hanna. Results indicated that speech and business communication students are being laught basically the same skills, that the trend toward a heavier emphasis on oral mode in business communication courses has been only slight, and that to date little effort to redesign curriculum with the Hanna study criteria or comparable categories included has been shown. © 1982, Sage Publications.

How does orality relate to literacy in the evolution of corporate documents? A qualitative study of how seven engineers in two divisions of a large corporation wrote for multiple audiences revealed that, in the more rhetorically successful cases observed, interaction was the central means of analyzing and adapting discourse to multiple audiences, fulfilling rhetorical and social goals, and building and sustaining a corporate culture; and orality was more potent than literacy in the engineers'composing behavior and the audiences' acceptance of the engineers' ideas and documents. © 1990, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.""The aim of this article is to show that a better awareness of the relationship between written and spoken communication can help the writer to improve his/her effectiveness. The focus will be on written texts that precede (formal and informal) discussions. The analysis will start with a description of the differences between orality and literacy. We shall deal with the functions of orality-based texts for the readers. Then we shall move to the writing process and explain how orality can find a place in this process, how it can be linked to creativity, and how it affects the way we plan the writing process. An oral way of writing is related to an important feature of speaking, namely fluency; but it also means a specific receiver orientation, dynamic rather than static and social rather than individual. Computer mediated communication could influence a more oral approach to written texts.""We synthesize the interdisciplinary literature into a heuristic for crafting effective organizational and supervisory apologies (the OOPS four-component apology). In the first experiment, we demonstrate how an offense committed by an organization is perceived to be more egregious than an offense committed by a friend or supervisor. Furthermore, results did not support that OOPS apologies are unequally effective if issued by a friend, supervisor, or organization. In the second experiment, we test OOPS apology-training effectiveness. Results indicated that trained participants crafted more effective apologies. Our apology heuristic is an innovation for training business communicators how to apologize effectively. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""An important contribution of this research is the testing in international environments of communication and culture models previously developed within U.S.A. high-technology organizations. Specifically, this research demonstrates that relationships among organizational culture themes, employee values, organizational communication activities, and perceptions of a variety of organizational outcomes are similar but not identical for U.S.A. and European high-technology organizations. Secondly, the research extends previous work by identifying cultural dimensions that are related to a variety of communication processes. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication."his article discusses developments in organizational communication from World War II through the 1950s. The major developments achieved during this period are classified in three categories: advances in technological or mathematical communication theory; experimentation with the behavioral ramifications of the human communication process; and applications of the contributions of these two research areas in attempts to achieve more effective communication and improved human relations in organizational settings.Many organizations are experimenting with structures (new organization forms) that are designed to facilitate empowered cross-functional communication. The challenge is to become more efficient or competitive by reducing barriers to communication and to eliminate boundaries which impede the understanding of end-to-end workflows and better performance on strategic goals. Horizontal organization processes such as cross-functional teamwork and empowered decision making at lower organization levels are based on more participative management styles (new management technologies). This paper builds a theoretical model and provides propositions showing how knowledge creation and communication are the foundations of the new organization forms. An organization's capability for creating and communicating knowledge is seen as a resource which can create global strategic competitive advantage. A longitudinal research program is proposed to study the progress of experiments by organizations utilizing the new organization forms and management technologies (NFMT). © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication."This article discusses the developments in organizational communication from 1960 to 1974. Informal communication channels in organizations received considerable attention during the 1960s, with emphasis on rumor generation and the use of the grapevine. The literature expanded its scope of research in this period to accommodate perspectives from the disciplines of psychology, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, social psychology, communication theory, neurophysiology, information technology, military information systems, and even the emerging field of psycholinguistics.""In a sense, Raymond V.

The research elicited and analyzed 560 short narratives from MBA students describing an actual on-the-job communication problem caused by another organization member's weak understanding of ""how we communicate here."" Respondents cited many more unwritten than written sources of guidance, naming 22 different means by which organizations conveyed guidance on ""how we communicate here."" Categorizing types of communication problems showed that about 20 percent could have been prevented or solved by communication policy guidelines; other kinds of managerial intervention are recommended for those owing more to bad individual judgment, poor managerial oversight, or dearth or inappropriateness of cues from corporate culture. Organizations with some written policy on communicating may have thought more about ""how we communicate here""and how to convey that information to employees. Respondents' cost estimates suggest that communication problems are a drain on profitability and effectiveness. Most organizations should examine how employees learn the communication rules at present and should introduce measures that reduce uncertainty. If employees can make sense of their work environments sooner and more accurately, errors are likely to diminish. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""Considers organizational innovativeness in Web site design with respect to organizational size and mutliple audiences Examines ways that organizational size is related to multiple audiences, and how these factors impact innovativeness in site design""The case study described in this article explores a U.S. team's adaptation of organizational training for Japanese audiences, with a particular focus on the team's management of social and physical spaces in which the training took place. Method: Qualitative research was used in this study, specifically a case study based on ethnological methods including interviews, observations, and collection of relevant documents. Results: Localization of the social and physical spaces that surround organizational training spaces includes recognizing their potential function as an important site for professional communication, especially in relationship-oriented cultures such as Japan. Beyond the need for this conceptual understanding, localization of organizational training also requires the practical navigation of these spaces. Such facility depends on professional communicators' understanding of proxemics, or the human use of space in cultural contexts, as well as wise reliance on the guidance of cultural insiders. Conclusions: When professional communicators work to localize organizational training, they must include all relevant communication channels and work to actively manage the physical and social spaces through which relationships are built and information is passed. An awareness of how space is used as a means of communication across cultures is essential.""While a significant amount of attention and interest has been directed to investigate the communicative functions of organizational websites, little research has been done to examine how internal organizational communication shapes organizational website design. This study employs the theory of rhetorical situation to examine the impact of internal organizational communication on website design. Specifically, it has examined a few organizational website design case studies from the perspective of rhetorical situation and has analyzed a case about website design by a Chinese student organization on a US college campus. Both the examination and analysis show that organizations and designers must communicate effectively in the process of identifying and thereafter transforming organizational objectives into effective website features. Both theoretical and practical implications for organizational website design are addressed in the paper. © 2007 IEEE.""This paper sets out a theory-based analysis of boundaries for four communication- focused subject areas that may be legitimately taught in business schools: organiza tional communication, business communication, management communication, and corporate communication. System, process, and product models provide the basis for the analysis. Those models were derived primarily from published definitions and taxonomies of the four areas. Such conceptual differentiation allows for a relatively objective determination of discipline boundaries and their interrelationships. © 1993, Sage Publications.

However, it may be driven by an organizational metaphor that limits the users' access and may not be open to the free associations it implies. Organization is important in hypertext, just as it is in print documents, both rhetorically and practically. Metaphors, links, and buttons aid users in identifying the organizational patterns, allow users to access information successfully, and provide connections that users may not make on their own.""Not too little too late but too much too soon is the quagmire into which many technical writers fall in writing descriptions.

When converting to microform for back files, the microfiche conversion can be a risky venture. Microfilm should always be preferred for collections. For simultaneous editions, the only medium is the microfiche, but publishers should be very cautious and should carefully test the market before launching a big venture. There are many surprises according to type of journal, but the audience also offers unpredictable features and changes its approach very rapidly.""This article considers how technical communication practitioners and teachers can approach Donald Schön’s notion of problem setting as rhetorical and reflective work that offers us a richer, more precise language for articulating the technologies, narratives, and values from which problems appear as problems in the first place. The author posits that problem setting, when foregrounded in our work, adds value to the knowledge we make in practice rather than the knowledge we gain from stepping back and abstracting. After briefly describing problem setting as a significant yet invisible practice already underlying technical communication, he then describes a vignette from a digital marketing and design firm to foreground problem setting as creative, on-the-spot reflective work that we often use to invent, rather than discern, problems in unstable situations. The larger goal of this article is to further investigate Schön’s past construction in order to examine how the practice of problem setting affects our ability to act within the instability of digital, divergent, and knowledge-intensive settings—the kinds of settings we regularly face in the workplace and the classroom. © The Author(s) 2014.""This text and outline coverage of Transactional Analysis, Gestalt Psychol ogy, and their application to General Semantics and writing represented part of the 1973 Teaching Methodology and Concepts Committee report.

The present article discusses outlining purposes or stating the nature of the present research, and listing research questions or hypotheses in the introduction of academic papers. This corpus-based genre study focuses particularly on Move 3 of the model ""occupying the niche."" The results indicating disciplinary variation show that the writers of Computer Science (CS) research articles, over the years have developed an increased use of outlining purpose/stating the nature of the present research, having the characteristics of purposive, descriptive, extension of the previous work, contrast to the existing work, brevity, complexity, and a description of methodology. It also shows that listing research questions or hypothesis may have distinctively different functions in developing genres as compared to the established ones such as physics.""“Comparing the topic outline with the sentence outline may change an amateur planner of writing into a professional one”. © 1976, Sage Publications.

The article relates the film to four different functions of film and shows how Outsourced can help create an intercultural experience for students, serve as the basis for a case analysis of cross-cultural adjustment, give meaning to cultural concepts, and create powerful metaphorical images to expand classroom discussions to broader issues. Also explored are ways the film can be used in teaching advanced intercultural communication concepts. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Despite the proven ability of color to enhance technical communication, many technical communicators and their teachers strongly avoid chromatic color.

To the uninitiated, automation represents a mystery at best and a threat at worst. An acute understanding of this fact by the key technical and management personnel responsible for the automated system is an important element in assuring the success of the transition process. Various types of people problems that can be encountered during a switch to automated composition are examined, and practical ways of alleviating those problems are described.""This article describes a ten-step process for developing a course on interactive videodiscs: (1) choosing the medium; (2) devising and documenting a 'vision' of the course; (3) choosing hardware and software tools to develop the course; (4) setting course conventions and style guidelines; (5) choosing the course development team; (6) flowcharting the course; (7) storyboarding and scriptwriting the course; (8) producing video, audio, and computer-generated text and graphics; (9) merging video, audio, computer-generated text and graphics, and course programming; and (10) debugging the course.""Engineers and public relations writers must cooperate to write public relations releases in a manufacturing firm. These releases represent the firm rather than any individual writer. An ethnographic study shows, however, that both engineers and public relations writers see at least some aspects of the releases as representing themselves personally. They therefore try to control content, wording, and authorship of the documents. Despite the difficulties they have in achieving such control, writers invest in corporate texts just as they do in personal ones. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

This focus on social presence and social psychological theories has led to valuable research on communication. However, little research (either empirical or theoretical) has been done to understand the ways in which media choices influence the cognitive processes that underlie communication. In this paper, we present a cognitive-based view of media choice and media use, based on dual process theories of cognition, which argue that in order for individuals to systematically process messages, they must be motivated to process the message and have the ability to process it. We argue that the use of rich media high in social presence induces increased motivation but decreases the ability to process information, while the use of lean media low in social presence induces decreased motivation but increases the ability to process information. The paradox of richness lies in its duality of impact: from a cognitive perspective, rich media high in social presence simultaneously acts to both improve and impair performance. © 2005 IEEE.""The Given-New Contract is a theory of information transfer that helps explain why unified and cohesive paragraphs are essential for effective written communications.

Specifically, she argues that Grice's Maxim of Relation operates analogously to the Gestalt principle of Continuity in visual perception. However, she also concludes that Grice's other three maxims have no analogs in Gestalt theory. We believe Grice's other maxims actually do have analogs in principles of visual perception, but the relationship between the two is opaque because they are stated in domain-specific terms. We suggest meta-principles that connect the two domains.""When newcomers join an organization, one of the most challenging tasks that they face is learning to write the way that particular organization recognizes as appropriate. Supervisors who review the writing produced by those newcomers are often expected to ensure that the documents meet organizational standards. This article, based on an ethnographic study of newcomers in two organizations, describes what newcomers need to learn in order to write appropriately and suggests resources and strategies that can help guide employees through the maze of organizational discourse conventions. Part II of this article (to be published in the September issue of the TRANSACTIONS) will describe how newcomers learn and will provide further suggestions for facilitating learning about writing in the workplace.""This article presents a report on the international communication activities of the American Business Communication Association (ABCA), as of June 1972.

Despite the wide availability of technical information on PLS, many behavioral and communication researchers often do not use PLS in situations in which it could provide unique theoretical insights. Moreover, complex models comprising formative (causal) and reflective (consequent) constructs are now common in behavioral research, but they are often misspecified in statistical models, resulting in erroneous tests. Key concepts: First-generation (1G) techniques, such as correlations, regressions, or difference of means tests (such as ANOVA or ${\rm t}$-tests), offer limited modeling capabilities, particularly in terms of causal modeling. In contrast, second-generation techniques (such as covariance-based SEM or PLS) offer extensive, scalable, and flexible causal-modeling capabilities. Second-generation (2G) techniques do not invalidate the need for 1G techniques however. The key point of 2G techniques is that they are superior for the complex causal modeling that dominates recent communication and behavioral research. Key lessons: For exploratory work, or for studies that include formative constructs, PLS should be selected. For confirmatory work, either covariance-based SEM or PLS may be used. Despite claims that lower sampling requirements exist for PLS, inadequate sample sizes result in the same problems for either technique. Implications: SEM's strength is in modeling. In particular, SEM allows for complex models that include latent (unobserved) variables, formative variables, chains of effects (mediation), and multiple group comparisons of these more complex relationships. © 2014 IEEE.""Although the benefits of internships seem clear, the path to participating in a successful technical communication internship experience is not always clear, and advice is scattered across many articles and Web sites. If you are a current student or a practitioner who is considering a return to school, you might have questions about finding internship opportunities, evaluating your options, and getting the most out of the experience. If you are a new internship coordinator, you might wonder how to manage 30-50 separate internships over the course of a semester. If you are an employer, you might have questions about how to establish an effective internship program at your company. Because an internship is a three-way partnership, this tutorial is divided into three sections providing advice to the major participants in this collaborative partnership: students, internship coordinators, and agency sponsors.""Image-based research conducted on and by research participants holds promise to extend participatory studies in technical communication by delivering research techniques that have been used for Policy Research in Public Health and other areas of participatory research (e.g., community-based participatory research).

This assessment is characterized by negotiation and dialog among various internal stakeholders, including students, administrators, faculty and instructors. Ultimately, the article offers a new model for program assessment—Participatory Assessment—which is built on recent research in participatory and user-centered design. The authors carefully distinguish Participatory Assessment from traditional expert review by reporting the processes and results of conducting such an assessment in a particular institutional and programmatic context. They conclude with a discussion of the relative merits of the Participatory Assessment model and its implications for practitioners and researchers in technical communication.""This article investigates the social justice implications of localization and reports the results of an empirical study that examines poor designer localization efforts in documentation used in marketing sexuopharmaceuticals.

Available characterization work on particle fracture is reviewed and models developed for thermal and kinetic stress mechanisms based on theoretical studies and test data. The models for each mechanism relate sorbent properties and design and operating parameters to sorbent attrition."The mixing rate and distribution of particles in centrifugal fluidized beds were investigated. Particles having different sizes were found to have steady state radial distributions in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Visual observations show that bubbles are the primary mechanism causing radial mixing, and the effectiveness and rate of mixing were found to increase with air flow rate. Based on the assumption that axial mixing can be described in terms of a diffusion model, the rate of axial mixing is expressed in terms of a mixing coefficient.""The author believes there are two reasons why technical writers use the passive voice so extensively: the passive requires no agent (e. g. , Aircraft are made of aluminum, rather than: Manufacturers make aircraft of aluminum); the passive voice helps retain the theme while putting the emphasis in the right place in periodic sentences (e. g. , The panel must be inspected by the second shift, to stress the agent, rather than: The second shift must inspect the panel). The author does not argue that the passive should be used in the wrong places. For instance, instructions still demand the imperative (e. g. , Lift that bale, not That bale is to be lifted! ). He concludes that both active and passive are needed, but that in technical writing the passive may be more useful than in other types of literature.""Various style manuals, advice to authors, and textbooks on writing stress that writers should prefer the active voice of the verb and avoid the passive form.

He quotes Thomas Sprat to emphasize that communication techniques should not be studied at a distance. the practice of scientific and technical writing must be brought closer to the university. Doing consulting work is one possibility; another is conducting communication research for business and industry. Additional specialized courses should be introduced for students specializing in the professions. English majors planning to work full time in communication should have internships provided. Sprat recognized that a bridge must exist between science and the humanities. This applies as well to the present condition.""Patent specifications have heuristic benefits as structural models for teaching technical description. Once taught how to read patents, students can use the specification's four main sections for writing assignments, structurally adapt ing a single topic-an invention-to different rhetorical contexts: (1) Back ground of the Invention describes the context into which the invention fits; (2) Summary of the Invention explains what makes the invention special; (3) Brief Description of the Drawings focuses on pictorial description; (4) Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention explains how to make the invention work. Parts 1 and 2 correspond to Aristotelian definition, while part 3 can work as physical description and part 4 as functional description or even performance instructions. © 1989, Sage Publications.

Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article investigates the design history of certain published artifacts - women's household sewing patterns - as that history is recorded in U.S. Patent Records. When a patented item is a published artifact, the U.S. Patent Record may contain valuable information on the author's perception of users and analysis of solutions for usability problems. This case illustrates the evolution toward a single standard despite early proprietary design solutions.""Research in organizational socialization outlines a common process of transition making. Newcomers first anticipate what the workplace and their involvement there will be like and then adjust these expectations upon encounter with organizational reality. Encounter often brings some disappointment, so struggles with motivation must be resolved before the initiates are ready to settle in and become contributing members. A survey of this research, illustrated with case study excerpts from undergraduate student interns, suggests that classes intended to prepare students for workplace communication can do so more effectively if they make students aware of this adjustment process and if they help students explore the possible writing implications of such nonwriting issues.""To empirically examine and document knowledge sharing patterns that practitioners employ in blog conversations about research and work experiences. Method: We conducted an empirical analysis of 235 blog posts from June 2014 to March 2016. We analyzed and coded each post for 14 unique variables including article type, topic, and citation style. We then analyzed the data using both descriptive and inferential statistics in order to reveal patterns in the data. Results: An overwhelming majority of the blog posts were written by practitioners for practitioners. Of the 235 blog posts, the most common topics were technology, professionalization, and communication strategies. Of the technology posts written, DITA was by far the most common technology topic. The most common article types were argumentative, process, and how-to articles. While practitioners rarely blog about research, when they do, they spend most of their time writing about results and discussion as opposed to introductions or methodology. Finally, our analysis revealed that bloggers made intentional visual design choices when sharing knowledge via blogs. Conclusion: Practitioners use distinct knowledge dissemination patterns in blog conversations that shape how research is presented to the technical communication community. Understanding these patterns is an important first step toward developing a shared language that will help bridge the gap in understanding between the academic and practitioner communities. Ultimately, blogs are a useful forum for studying practitioner conversations and developing broader understanding about what they value in their work and research. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Stressing the fact that good business commun ication requires a psychological pattern of organization, this article offers specific advice on organizing informative, good news, direct request, and persuasive messages, together with a detailed rationale for each pattern. The article also shows the student how the patterns can be used to fit more specific communications problems by applying the direct request and persuasive patterns to the two basic kinds of job application letters. © 1977, Sage Publications.

Calling on the field to “pay attention” to this issue, the authors report the results of a national survey of online writing instructors and use Selfe’s landmark essay as a way to theoretically frame the results. They conclude by offering strategies for TPC instructors to design more accessible online courses. © The Author(s) 2014.""This article reports on the utility of personal digital assistants (PDAs) for processing information needed in coordinated, team-based medical work. I first present results from a survey of medical professionals, which reveal that medical professionals read PDA-based texts nonlinearly, in short bursts, and without need of a narrative-based organization. The respondents also reported using PDAs to support a range of team-based activities. I then present results of a case study of veterinary students using PDAs on clinical rotations. I discuss how the PDA affords uses of text-based information that are suited to medical work that is carried out with the cooperative assistance of people and technologies. After discussing how veterinary students used PDAs to organize information into ad hoc texts, I conclude with challenges and information design guidelines for professional writers in the medical field. © 2005 IEEE.""Scholars in professional communication have called for a reexamination of pedagogy, asking that it instruct students not simply in the forms of workplace discourse but also in the connections between that discourse and socially responsible communicative action. This article posits that narrative can provide a basis for a pedagogy of social action—for a pedagogy, that is, that enables students to understand the workings of power and cultural reproduction in professional settings and that fosters reflection, critique, and dialogue. The article first reviews narrative theory supporting this claim, then discusses ways that teachers can use narrative to help students critique examples of professional discourse and their own composing choices. The article closes by discussing both the concerns about and the possibilities for such a pedagogy. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

This study collected data on three groups (self, peers, and instructor) to address four research ques tions related to (a) the usefulness of self and peer ratings as substitutes for instruc, tor evaluation of oral business presentations and (b) the relationship between vari ous content and non-content factors on overall perceptions of presentation quality. Data from this study suggest that (1) both holistic and analytical peer assessments are reasonable substitutes for instructor assessment when raters are trained; (2) self assessment does not closely reflect either peer or instructor assessments; and (3) peer assessment of delivery characteristics, command of material, and content strongly predict peer ratings of overall presentation quality. © 2001, Sage Publications.

The subjects included 20 first-year MBA students who demonstrated proficiency in writing and interpersonal skills. Nine students chose to participate. The analysis includes conversations, actions, and reflections of peer tutors during the training period. The process involved instructors with peer-tutor training experience, a selection procedure that incorporated a student-centered philosophy, several general meetings to orient and deal with concerns about tutoring, and a number of simulated sessions that moved the tutors from sentence- to discourse-level concerns. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

The article presents an example of efficient systems procedure.""Technical writers and teachers of technical writing need to recognize that perceptions about spatial relationships—which the anthropologist Edward Hall calls “proxemics”—vary from culture to culture. Consequently they must reexamine the fifty/fifty ratio of white space to text which has become the standard formatting formula in America. An examination of technical documents designed specifically for an international audience does indeed demonstrate the accepted ratio; however, Hall’s work with other cultures, most notably the English, Japanese, and Arabs, suggests that the fifty/fifty ratio of white space to text may not always be applicable to local audiences. International scientific and technical documents published in English tend to conform to American spatial concepts perhaps because English is the international language for these publications. But an examination of articles in foreign languages, even those designed for international readers, demonstrates subtle differences in spatial arrangements. The small body of research available on document design for other than American audiences suggests that Hall’s identifying characteristics of other cultures’ spatial attitudes would be helpful in designing manuals or instructions specifically for a local audience, such as the Japanese. If we want to increase our markets and offer American products to users in other societies, we must consider their cultural perceptions about space and adapt our document design accordingly. © 1992 IEEE""The present study investigated the relationship between perceptions of supervisor com municator competence and supervisor satisfaction as a result of quality circle involve ment. A total of 104 quality circle participants comprising 12 quality circles at a large defense contractor in a west coast city were employed in the study. Specifically, com parisons were made between perceptions among participants of newly formed circles and ones which had been in operation for six months. Data from the study were sub mitted to multiple regression and one-tailed t tests. The results of the study indicated that supervisors who participated in quality circles for six months were perceived as being more communicatively competent (particularly on an encoding dimension) than their counterparts who had just joined the program. In addition, subordinates were more satisfied with them. However, the old circle supervisors did not perceive themselves as more communicatively competent. Implications of the findings and directions for fu ture research were advanced. © 1989, Sage Publications.

First, perceptual variations exist within a country, and they sharpen even more across countries and cultures. International business communication students need to be aware of such differences on substantive issues. Second, critical pedagogy maintains that making students think and revisit their worldviews through an encounter with discomforting or decentering ideas is a valuable teaching and learn ing tool. Exposing students in my class to controversial propositions caused them to demonstrate a gamut of reactions from agreement and disagreement to anger, pity, disbelief, and a sense of discovery. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Some empirical studies into the effect of metaphors in software manuals showed a positive influence on computer task performance, although this influence proved to be a conditional one. A necessary condition must be that readers understand the metaphor used; readers must have knowledge about its source domain. The most understandable concept for all humans seems to be a human being; the metaphor with human beings as a source domain is called personification or anthropomorphism. Up to now, no coherent theory has been available about linguistic expressions that can be labeled as anthropomorphism, and no empirical data have been gathered about expressions in software manuals that are perceived as such by readers. Therefore, an explorative experiment with real manual material was carried out. Expressions suggesting that computers or programs have feelings or an affective relationship to the user, that they are able to perform non-routine (mental) activities and communicate their intentions through human language use, appear to be perceived as anthropomorphistic. Such expressions might help readers to use a computer (program) more easily.""This study documents the tendency of hearers to misperceive the contents of paid political radio advertising, particularly for high-credibility candidates:they read in even more positive information than is in the actual ad. © 1973, Sage Publications.

In previous attempts to quantify accuracy in science news reporting, many of the sources' comments pointed to objective errors, but a sizable number dealt with lack of completeness or stylistic issues. There has been no consensus among communication researchers on the kind of scheme that should be used to code such information. We suggest a scheme for categorizing empirical information about the different kinds of perceived ""errors"" that technical sources identify in articles about their work by journalists and other writers. This study may lead to strategies for enhancing the accuracy of popular writings about science and technology.""We report our survey research about what American business professionals consider appropriate or civil mobile phone behavior during formal and informal meetings. The findings come from two of our recent research studies: an open-ended survey of 204 employees at a beverage distributor on the East Coast and a nationwide, random-sample survey of 350 business professionals in the United States. There were significant differences by age, group, gender, region, and income level. The differences between women and men were quite striking, with men nearly twice as likely to consider various mobile phone behaviors as acceptable in informal meetings. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Reports perceptions of slides with two- and three-dimensional bar charts and different color combinations Recommends use of two-dimensional bar graphs, backgrounds that contrast with graph area colors, and cool colors over warm colors.""To find out more about the communication needs of people in business, the author sent questionnaires to 2,200 chief executive officers (CEOs) and directors of personnel or training. I received 207 answers. Respondents believe that oral communication before a small group is important and that principles of communication should be stressed over formats for letters and memos. They believe reading and editing, as well as grammar skills, are very important. In many respects, the results of this survey are similar to those of others done across the country in the past 20 years, but there are some comments on reading, editing, and writing letters with bad news that were not part of earlier surveys. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

To find out more about how managers' listening is perceived in an organizational context, researchers administered a questionnaire to 144 managers and 827 of their subordinates in 6 hospitality organizations. Managers were asked to rate 26 of their own listening behaviors using a 7-point scale. Subordinates were asked to indicate their perceptions of their managers' listening behavior on each of the same 26 items. Profiles are presented of those managers who were perceived as particularly “good” or particularly “poor” listeners according to the ratings given them by their subordinates. Characteristics of those employees who gave their managers the highest and lowest ratings are also described. This information contributes to a better understanding of how managers' listening is perceived in organizational contexts. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Business writing textbooks function similarly, using guidelines, sample assignments, and model documents to help students develop rhetorical strategies to use in the workplace. Students attend class, or read and perform exercises in a textbook, with the faith that these skills will apply to workplace writing. In an attempt to better understand the similarities and differences between industry and academe's expectations of one genre of workplace writing, the memo, we compared the perceptions of memo quality by engineering faculty, students, and practitioners. All three groups responded to three sample memos taken from textbooks used by engineering professors in their undergraduate classrooms. The results indicate that students' and engineers' opinions of memo quality were more closely related to one another than to professors' comments, focusing on content, while professors were the most critical of style issues. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Channel expansion theory predicts positive relationships between knowledge-building experiences and perceptions of a medium's capacity for conveying complex information. To date, channel expansion has only been tested in a pair of studies focused upon perceptions of a single medium-email. The present investigation replicates the initial tests of channel expansion theory, assesses the validity of the theory for two additional media, examines whether differences in media explain additional variation in richness perceptions, and analyzes the relationships between expansion predictors and dimensions of richness across three media. Data from 529 organizational media users revealed the following: (1) knowledge-building experiences with a medium, communication partner, topic, and social influences are positively related to perceptions of a medium's richness, (2) these relationships are fairly consistent across email, telephone, and face-to-face, (3) differences in richness are attributable to differences between media, and (4) expansion variables appear to be selectively related to richness dimensions and these relationships vary across media. © 2008 IEEE.""The authors applied the semantic differential technique to measure managerial and white-collar employee perceptions of the grapevine. In general, the grapevine was viewed as an influential, but negative factor in the informal organization. Managers now have available to them methodologies for evaluating not only the mechanics of the grapevine, but also its impact on employees. Several implications for managers are also discussed. © 1974, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.""This study tested the relationship between performance and the readability of annual reports.

Most of the research on performance appraisal interviews has focused on strategic aims and interview design, but less attention has been given to the way in which performance appraisal interviews actually take place. In this study, the focus will, therefore, be to investigate how one of the crucial and most delicate activities in performance appraisal interviews, namely, giving critical feedback, is conducted. The way critical feedback is given is predominantly through negative assessments. The results indicate that there is an orientation to critical feedback as a socially problematic action despite the institutional character of the talk. Moreover, it can be seen that the more the supervisor shows an orientation to negative assessments as being socially problematic, the more difficult it becomes for the employee to deal with negative assessments. The study ends by outlining various implications for the workplace. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Understanding data-modeling performance can provide valuable lessons for the selection, training, research, and development of data models. Data modeling is the process of transforming expressions in loose natural language communications into formal diagrammatic or tabular expressions. While researchers generally agree that abstraction levels can be used to explain general performance differences across models, empirical studies have reported many construct level results that cannot be explained. To explore further explanations, we develop a set of model-specific construct complexity values based on both theoretical and empirical support from complexity research in databases and other areas. We find that abstraction levels and complexity values together are capable of providing a consistent explanation of laboratory experiment data. In our experiment, data were drawn from three models: the relational model, the extended-entity-relationship model, and the object-oriented model. With the newly developed complexity measures, a consistent explanation can be made for findings from other studies which provide sufficient model details for complexity values to be calculated. © 2006 IEEE.""Public speakers whose primary responsibility is the giving of technical or scientific information need to acquaint themselves with an orderly and consistent design for organizing, supporting, and delivering an oral presentation so that they more effectively engage in dynamic communication with an audience. The elements of such a design are an analysis of audience interest in and knowledge of the topic, the role of speech in presenting highly complex technical or scientific language, and the principles of dynamic communication as they relate to audience perception and retention of information. This guide includes a comprehensive survey of the public speaking situation, suggestions for vocal delivery and scripting, and a checklist of common errors made in presenting factual material.""""Performativity"" theory offers a useful framework for illuminating the role that organizational discourse plays in engendering new social imaginaries. In this article, the authors demonstrate this point through a genealogy and textual analysis of the Ricelands Habitat Partnership (RHP), an eco-collaboration between the rice industry and environmental advocates in California's Sacramento Valley. Articulated here as a story of enemies becoming friends, the RHP gives life to a vision of more (if not perfectly) sustainable agriculture, where sustaining business and the natural environment can go hand in hand. The authors argue that sustainable development (like democracy or other abstract concepts) becomes ""real"" for businesses and for society at large through local enactment. That is, new understandings and practices of sustainability are brought into being and institutionalized through the stories that they generate. Attention to the performative effects of language points to the ethical dimensions of our own research and writing. It suggests the need to consider the potentially world-changing effects of stories that we choose to tell. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""Periodical literature has a significant place in most research disciplines partly because of its unique packaging and marketing features. Librarians neither influence the amount or format of published information nor control the sources of library funding. During the past six years, the sharp reductions in purchasing ability have put producers as well as consumers of information under stress. Various efforts in resource sharing remove the reader yet one more step from the material and can be only part of a solution. Government, academic and professional organizations, and commercial publishers are urged to consider new ways to help libraries improve their vital role in the distribution of scientific literature and information.""Traditionally, technical writers have de-emphasized their presence in their documents by adopting the role of the disinterested reporter. More recently, with the diversification of audiences for microcomputer documentation, writers have begun to abandon the traditional posture and to establish themselves as teachers, a function that pressures them to reassess their part in their prose and often to identify themselves to their audiences. This paper examines the classical notion of persona (the role adopted by the writer) as a term useful in analyzing technical documents. It isolates several rhetorical strategies that are components of the user-friendly persona and briefly speculates on the usefulness of those strategies given the interactive relationship between the writer and the audience.""The use of personal, reflective writing exercises is well documented in the disciplines of composition and management, and each discipline has been highly influential in establishing pedagogical practices in the business communication classroom. However, we see little evidence of the pedagogical practice, the use of personal reflective writing exercises, in the teaching of business communication. This article looks at pedagogy and theory that informs the use of personal, reflective writing exercises in composition and management and suggests the relevance of these same practices in business communication classrooms today. Building on relevant pedagogical theory and practice, the author also makes the claim that personal reflective writing exercises can make students better writers and more effective managers and leaders. The article concludes with sample exercises that readers might try in their own business communication classrooms. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Organizational newcomers go through various socialization processes before becoming organizational veterans. Information seeking (a self-socialization process) involves newcomers' proactively seeking new information, most times to reduce uncertainty. This study assessed how personality traits, specifically, Costa and McCrae's Big Five, affect this process. Multiple regression analyses indicate that certain traits influence information seeking directly and via the mediation of social costs. Of particular note are the results surrounding extroversion. Specifically, the data suggest a direct relationship between extroversion and covert relational information seeking, whereas perceived relational social costs also mediate this relationship. Several important extensions to the literature are discussed herein. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""There is a move in technical writing today toward a personalized, 'user-friendly' writing style which is strikingly evident in many computer textbooks and instructional manuals. The author presents the results of a study to determine which style of writing people prefer in a computer tutorial, given the choice between formal, moderately friendly, and extremely friendly texts, and whether their level of computer expertise affects their selection.""Textbooks describing scientific or technical writing as ″impartial″ or ″objective″ are too restrictive. As advances in the history of science have familiarized us with the importance of human element in science, so the human element must also be given its due in writing in the area. Our students will often be engaged in communication that involves adaptation for an audience relatively unfamiliar with the subject being presented, and they must be aware that the personal touch can arouse interest and sharpen awareness and understanding. History can serve as a source of writing models that successfuly use the personal touch.""No study has explored how incorporating personas into heuristic evaluation of products, namely websites, affects the kinds of findings reported and the recommendations presented by usability evaluators. Research questions: (1) Do findings resulting from heuristic evaluations of a website without the use of personas differ from findings resulting from heuristic evaluations of the same website with the use of personas? (2) Do findings from persona-based heuristic evaluations in which evaluators develop their own personas differ from findings from persona-based heuristic evaluations in which evaluators are given personas? (3) If findings and recommendations are different, how do they differ? (4) How does the use of personas affect the evaluators' confidence in the findings of a heuristic evaluation? Literature review: First, previous research of heuristic evaluation has concluded that although heuristic evaluation is inexpensive and does not require advance planning, it has several shortcomings, including its too-intense focus on minor issues and its inability to capture all usability issues. Second, data-driven personas, which have long been a resource in user-centered design, have been suggested as a way to improve or enhance heuristic evaluation, and several studies suggest that usability professionals are indeed using personas in their evaluations. However, no empirical study has assessed heuristic evaluations that include personas. Methodology: In this exploratory study involving three sections of an advanced technical writing course, groups of evaluators conducted a heuristic evaluation of a website. Each section was randomly assigned a different condition with which they would conduct the heuristic evaluation: (a) a traditional heuristic evaluation, (b) a persona-led heuristic evaluation in which the personas were given to the evaluators, or (c) a persona-led heuristic evaluation in which the evaluators themselves created their own personas. Each group wrote a report identifying the major problems with the website and provided recommendations to solve the identified problems. The evaluators completed pretesting demographic surveys and posttesting confidence surveys. Results and discussion: This exploratory study found few detectable differences in the findings reported by groups that used personas in heuristic evaluation and groups that did not use personas. The groups that used personas were more likely to report findings related to navigation than the groups that did not use personas, while the groups that did not use personas were more likely to report findings related to design than the groups that used personas. The groups that created their own personas were more likely than the other groups to include complex issues in their reports and include language that directly references users and user needs. All groups were confident in their findings. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""No study has explored how incorporating personas into heuristic evaluation of products, namely websites, affects the kinds of findings reported and the recommendations presented by usability evaluators.

The findings were derived from four sources: semistructured interviews with 28 Chinese professionals; four ""week-in-the-life"" case studies, which include an all-day office observation; analyses of telephone conference recordings and email chains; and a questionnaire survey involving more than 2,000 respondents. The evidence suggests that English, particularly its written form, plays a crucial role in business communication, although the nature and extent of its use vary according to an array of institutional and individual factors, such as a company's ownership and a professional's duties. The qualitative data illustrate the interplay between the two written (English, Chinese) and three spoken codes (English, Cantonese, Putonghua) in workplace communication, and particularly the symbiotic relationship between written English and Cantonese. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""In July, 1996, The Prudential Insurance Company agreed to pay a $35 million fine for misleading sales practices after a task force of insurance regulators from 11 states and the District of Columbia found that Prudential agents had engaged in misconduct. This article examines Prudential's actions, its response to the ethical crisis, and the ways in which the organization communicated its response to stakeholders. Many of Prudential's sins were rhetorical: Agents misrepresented some products to customers. Charges of misrepresenting products to clients stem back to problems with its securities division, then known as Prudential-Bache. Prudential is making amends to its customers who were harmed by egregious sales practices, but it may take the organization a long time to recover customer goodwill and the damage incurred to its reputation. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""Although the proposal is written before and the report after the research, both require the application of principles that will demonstrate to the reader two skills needed by every investigator: clear thinking to produce worthwhile research, and clear writing to communicate the results of that research. Sharp delineation of the problem to be addressed, thoughtful preliminary preparation, careful outlining, and concentration on orderly sequence of ideas in the first draft will help produce a unified, coherent proposal. Critical revision, with emphasis on simple, direct, forceful language will enhance the persuasiveness of the proposal.""A technical proposal may be beautifully printed, tastefully laid out, and faultlessly composed, but if the words do not ″sell,″ no amount of brochuremanship will produce a winner.

The fundraising package consists of the carrier envelope, the fundraising letter, the reply form, the reply envelope, and optional enclosures such as brochures, small gifts for the reader, and surveys to complete. These parts work together to perform the following tasks: 1) persuade recipients to open the envelope and read the letter; 2) convince readers a serious but not unsolvable problem exists; 3) make readers want to help solve the problem; 4) convince readers they can help by giving to the appealing organization; 5) tell readers what the organization needs them to do; and 6) make it easy to comply.""Participants in a qualitative case study of nonacademic R&D authors were uncomfortable with the idea of persuasion in their writing. The participants thought their reports were more informative than persuasive. Three definitions for ""persuasion"" emerged: discourse intended to push a reader toward an action; discourse written in a clear, compelling style; and shady, manipulative discourse. When asked whether they owed a greater debt to their audience or to their subject matter, most participants chose subject matter. However, some participants argued that my question posed a false dichotomy, in that serving subject matter was the best way to serve audience.""The relationship between the technical writer and his or her audience will directly dictate the format, style, and purpose of the information to be communicated. This paper explores the structures of that process and how these structures change as the technical processor's audience changes.""Traditionally, technical writing has been characterized by impersonal, mechanical, objective prose. However, this attempt to deanthropomorphize reality must ultimately fail because science cannot escape metaphorical language. There is a move in technical writing today toward a personalized, sometimes called 'friendly', writing style which is strikingly evident in many computer text books and instructional manuals.""Philanthropic discourse is increasingly present in the workplace. Given that one's identity is often shaped by work, employees are likely to be influenced by the discourse and activities of their philanthropic-minded employers. This case study, as part of a larger project, used qualitative methods to explore how one employer may inform and influence individuals' philanthropic identity, as evidenced by employees' perceived changes in their charitable attitudes and behaviors since employment. Findings revealed that the workplace and workplace interactions strengthened employees' philanthropic values and influenced behaviors in ways that both increased time and money donated and shaped decisions about charity choice. In summary, the corporation both enabled and encouraged the enactment of an employee identity that reflected a philanthropic self. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Phoenix area personnel managers regarded all of a selected list of topics representing different aspects of writing as important; however, physical layout was judged to be the least important relatively. The most important problems in written communication were related to organization, contents, and spelling. Physical layout, typing, and punctuation were rated at least important. Formal procedures for assessing writing skill of potential employees were regarded as only moderately important for the recent college graduate and the experienced manager. The managers suggested that writing skill (or a lack of it) as revealed in the application blank is important in the hiring process, and that the degree of such skill manifested by managers after employment is very significant in the promotion process. Writing skill is assessed during performance appraisal in some companies, and most supervisors encouraged the development of employee writing skill.""A changed perception of the value of information is a basic element in the new economics of journal publishing flowing from the Senate mandated ″workable licensing and clearance″ procedures.

Although previous studies have indicated that companies’ local culture may be reflected in the images they employ, scholars have never systematically investigated the use of visual rhetoric as it is used across different business cultures. This study analyzes visual rhetoric using a new model of visual metadiscourse—a set of devices that designers use to convey meaning in order to influence the audience’s interpretation of the text. The study compares the visual metadiscourse in photos used in English management statements in the annual reports of Dutch and U.K. companies. The results show that metadiscourse is inherent not only in the written text of a corporate document but also in the visuals that a design team chooses to include. The results also indicate that despite some similarities, Dutch-based and U.K.-based statements contain differences in their use of visual metadiscourse. Several of these differences can be attributed to cultural differences between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The study underlines the applicability of the new model and warns international text designers not to overlook cultural differences in visual metadiscourse. © The Author(s) 2015.""In order to correctly and concisely understand a scientific, technical English article written by Japanese specialists, readers should understand in what areas of English grammar Japanese are inclined to make mistakes when they write an English version. The most crucial mistakes made are usually certain aspects of English grammar. Learning the key mistakes from a Japanese specialist will also help an Engish teacher focus more efficiently on profitable areas of teaching.""This article examines the path to practical, economic use of computerization in publishing and communication. Convinced that the computer is here to stay, the author emphasizes the problems it poses as related to the questions it answers at this time. He details six pit falls to be avoided by prospec tive computerizers. His eon clusions spring from recent hard-core personal experiences as well as from a penetrating analysis of the long-term po tentials of computerization.

To explore global learners' cultural perspectives on the social climate of an online class, we first review the social presence theory-which can be used to examine the social climate in an online classroom, and explain factors that contribute to learners' social presence. Then we report findings of a survey conducted among a group of Chinese business students and discuss specific aspects of an online business communication class which might contribute to enhancing global learners' sense of social presence in an online environment. We conclude the study by explaining the present study's implications for delivering effective online business and technical communication courses with global learners and recommending strategies for increasing global audiences' social presence in an online class created by the instructor and the online community. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Readability formulas are inadequate measures of how difficult written material is for adult readers, say these authors. In fact, readability formulas are counterproductive because they focus the writer's attention on words and sentences and draw attention away from important sources of readers' problems. Readability formulas are being used in contexts where they have no research base, and they are being misused by writers who rewrite to achieve a specific required score. A better way of assessing readability is user testing. This article has three parts. We begin by defining the topic for those who are not familiar with readability formulas. In the main part of the article, we discuss five facts that lead us to recommend that writers not use readability formulas. In the final section, we suggest another approach to testing documents and some possibilities for making this alternative financially and managerially feasible.""Punctuation is based upon simple principles. The ″rules″ - which one can find in all sorts of books are usually true enough, but they tend to make the matter seem unnecessarily complicated, and they do not show why they are true. The more practical approach is to consider certain typical situations and what they naturally require. The important thing, of course, is good sentence-structure. What correct punctuation does is to keep that structure unmistakably clear for the innocent reader who does not know what is coming.""We carried out a comprehension study in the Netherlands of words discouraged by the Plain English Movement (PEM) and those recommended by the movement’s institutions. In our study, we restricted ourselves to the guidelines of one of these institutions, namely the Plain English Campaign (PEC). As the Dutch are familiar with British spellings, terminology, and linguistic usage, it seemed to us it would make sense to select PEM guidelines that are predominantly based on British English. The research questions we wished to address in our research were the following:Are words that are considered to be difficult for native speakers of English also considered to be difficult by native speakers of Dutch?Do native speakers of Dutch comprehend words discouraged by the PEC less well than words recommended by the PEC?Do native speakers of Dutch prefer words discouraged by the PEC or words recommended by the PEC?Research questions 2 and 3 were our main research questions, but we wanted to get an answer to research question 1 too. If, after all, the words discouraged by PEC were not considered to be difficult by speakers of Dutch—because they resemble words in Dutch, for instance—there would be no need for us to examine the second research question. We examined this first question by way of a small-scale preliminary study and the two main research questions by means of an experiment. In this article we first describe the design and the results of the preliminary study before moving on to the design and the results of the experiment we performed to answer the two main research questions.""The Internet is revolutionizing the investment world. There are clear benefits to these changes, including lower costs and faster access to the market for investors. There also are consequences to these changes when investors take risks without having access to clear, accurate, and full disclosures. In a free-market system, investors must have access to information they can understand and use autonomously to have full and equal access to the investment market. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently passed a rule requiring businesses to use plain English to try and rid disclosures of their traditionally complex and ambiguous language. However, SEC's rule only addresses the front and back sides of prospectus disclosures. Consequently, the success of plain English will depend on the writer and business using it. Public corporations committed to using plain English will empower investors with the information they need to participate in the market freely and safely. In return, businesses will create a more effective and efficient free-market system by maximizing utility, benefiting producers, consumers, and the market as a whole. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""he article focuses on the use of plain English language in U.S. legal documents. There is an increasing effort by consumer groups and businesses to simplify commercial and legal documents. Due in part to this trend a major ruling in favor of the plain English movement was issued by U.S. District Court Judge Jack Weinstein in July, 1984. The movement aims to evaluate the adequacy of communication associated with the use of plain English. Its supporters speculate that the use of plain English will make it easier to conduct business. ""Often the term “plain English” is equated with “readability,” or the movement to make specialized language easier to understand. While practitioners should indeed strive for an understandable style, this article argues that more compel ling imperatives underlie plain English, especially in business. A genuine belief in honest, responsive communication, for example, needs to be central to a company's values and culture if plain English is to become anything more than a blue-collar version of hype. Beyond that, the company needs to implement carefully considered policies to insure that plain English establishes itself as the mainstay of healthy communication. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Our mixed-methods research examines whether the application of certain PL guidelines affects the comprehension and perceptions of readers of environmental policy documents. Results show that the presence of pronouns affects inferential comprehension of environmental impact statement summaries (EIS summaries), but that the effect varies with the reader's education level. Further, headings in question phrasing affect a reader's perception of familiarity and reliability of EIS summaries. A reader's perceptions of EIS summaries and attitudes toward the organizations creating the documents are also affected by overall design features. PL guidelines on the use of pronouns and question headings are not fully supported by our research and need further validation with regard to comprehension.

A hierarchical 'document tree' is used which guides the company to set policies, develop standards, write procedures, and produce drawings and manuals in a coordinated fashion. Using this system, each item that is produced becomes part of an accumulating body of documentation that improves the efficiency of management, production, and contract fulfillment. The program for technical documentation will support the company's quality assurance program.""Discusses requirements for assisting universities outside the U.S. to prepare their students for participation in global industry Identifies goals, delivery methods, and outcomes for such programs Considers general programmatic goals and cultural influences rather than presenting a detailed plan for execution.""Many audiovisual presentations begin with a technical paper, but neither of the following extremes yields a successful talk: showing the original illustrations as slides or foils while reading the paper, or illustrating every point in the paper while narrating additional detail. The successful paper-to-talk conversion requires selecting only the main points; illustrating them with imagination and clarity; rethinking the order of presentation to accommodate the linear nature of an oral presentation - the audience cannot refer to an earlier portion, underline phrases, annotate the margins, etc; complementing the visual aids with narration rather than written text; and developing supplementary materials for clarification, questions, and challenges.""Plans and section views of an idealized technical presentations classroom are presented.

In spite of the many hours people devote weekly to meetings, few studies have examined the written and oral communications used in planning and managing scheduled meetings. This paper reports on a study of thirty-five organizational meetings, each from a different organization. The development and use of five primary tools for planning and managing meetings were examined, and the relationships of these tools to meeting processes were analyzed. The results were consistent with prior findings regarding the use of agendas, while offering additional information regarding the use of support documents, announcements, meeting minutes, and evaluations. Control of these tools varied by group leaders/facilitators, secretaries, and other participants; and the strongest relationships were found between the use of agendas, minutes, and support documents and the timing of meetings (duration, delays). Finally, traditional media (for example, flip charts, chalk hoards, transparencies) and higher-level technologies (for example, computers, VCRs) were largely absent from meetings, consistent with the findings of prior research. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Holding a successful conference year after year constitutes a hallmark of excellence for a professional society. While many factors contribute to the success of such a meeting, a key factor is careful planning and organization. To aid the first-time conference chairperson, this paper describes a systematic approach to conference planning and organization: (1) making preliminary analyses and assessments; (2) obtaining the agreement of cosponsors; (3) selecting key conference officers; (4) organizing conference committees; (5) selecting the conference site hotel, and dates; (6) developing the conference master plan; (7) following through and implementing planning decisions; (8) anticipating and managing contingencies; and (9) coordinating post-conference activities. Using a systematic approach simplifies the task and makes it possible to run an annual meeting successfully.

Many component content -management (CCM) thought leaders have identified people factors as a major barrier to successful CCMS implementation. They recognize the necessity of gaining buy-in from all stakeholders and persuading CCMS users to change their habits of practice, follow new processes, and learn new authoring tools and methodologies. This tutorial complements existing discussions of people factors by offering a more complex understanding of what these factors really mean and how to negotiate them.Key concepts: This understanding is articulated through three situated views of CCMSs and their diffusion in organizations: (1) CCMSs are social constructs; (2) CCMS diffusion is a multistage, perception-driven communication process; and (3) CCMS diffusion is mediated by different components of organizational culture. These situated views highlight the shaping force of cultural dynamics in CCMS diffusion projects, and they speak to some of the reasons why common information transfer approaches to diffusion do not work.Key lessons: Given these views, CCM initiative leaders should consider the following recommendations for carrying out a CCMS diffusion project: (1) assess cultural dynamics in the organization and (2) implement diffusion enablers to facilitate shared understanding and learning and to guide actions toward common goals. Key lessons offer a comprehensive set of sample research questions that can be used to assess cultural dynamics as well as three kinds of diffusion enablers that can be implemented: interactive communication channels, training programs, and collaboratively developed guides.Implications: CCM initiative leaders who understand and plan for the shaping force of cultural dynamics in the CCMS diffusion process and who follow best practices for transitioning to CCM will improve their chances for a successful CCMS implementation. Leaders are encouraged to use the research questions and diffusion enablers are articulated here as a starting point for negotiating people factors that can impede diffusion. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article constitutes a chaper in a projected book on publishing in technical journals and magazines. The book has been written primarily for professional men and women who have something to contribute beyond their day-to-day requirements. This particular chapter discusses the organization of the technical article as distinct from the technical paper. Wherever possible, examples have been drawn from current publications."The organization of the technical paper as distinct from the technical article is discussed. The relationship of the paper to the report is shown and the practices of several scientific and technical journals are compared."Poetry recitation removes the distractions of creating and organizing original material so that business students can focus on presentation skills of delivery, confidence, and memory. Delivery includes articulation, emphasis, nonverbals, and presence. Confidence and memory development are complementary. Confidence comes from trusting the memory and memory adds confidence. Memory is treated as a larger skill for business, not as a crutch for presenting. Rationale, resources, implementation and evaluation for this assignment are all detailed. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""Pedagogical and scholarly representations of collaborative writing and knowledge construction in technical communication have traditionally recognized consensus as the logical outcome of collaborative work, even as scholars and teachers have acknowledged the value of conflict and ""dissensus"" in the process of collaborative knowledge building. However, the conflict-laden work product of a Denver task force charged with recommending changes to the city police department's use-of-force policy and proposing a process for police oversight retains the collaborative group's dissensus and in doing so, illustrates an alternative method of collaborative reporting that challenges convention. Such an approach demonstrates a dissensus-based method of reporting that has the potential to open new rhetorical spaces for collaborative stakeholders by gainfully extending collaborative conversations and creating new opportunities for ethos development, thus offering scholars, teachers, and practitioners a way of reimagining the trajectory and outcome of collaborative work.""Policy and procedure documents play an important role in developing and maintaining a consistent quality of interaction in organizations. Unfortunately, the pedagogical and research literatures are weak in this area. Here, we attempt to initiate further discussion by defining and describing policy and procedure documents, and identify a third kind, work instructions. A genre approach is used to outline characteristics based on information type, institutional purpose, and organizational functions. Rhetorical, audience, and functional linguistics analyses are used to describe more specific characteristics.""Relatively little is known about the politeness strategies used by technical communicators and designers in group settings, particularly in the decision-making, collaborative meetings of a real-world, naturally occurring group.

When the national languages took over the position formerly occupied by Latin, the German language seemed to rank as the most prominent in international intercommunication. However, the two world wars in particular have undermined this position, and English has taken its place. Some data are presented which indicate this historical pathway.""The Political Philosophy Continuum possesses broader research possibili ties than the name implies.

These factors include stresses, preferences, biases, alliances, ambitions, conflicts, and friendships. The spectrum of political situations can range from few or no face-to-face contacts to continuing dialogue between writer and reader. A survey of political reality helps a writer to assess both the probable and the desired outcome from a writing job. That same assessment may help the writer to reach the desired outcome and to avoid problems. Sometimes such an assessment can prevent disaster. This article offers several ideas and techniques to guide writers in assessing political reality.

As public statements about one of the most difficult business and ethical issues ever faced by U.S. corporations, these papers constitute a special moment in the history of business writing. Unique in its economic, political, and ethical complexity, this situation required corporations to depart from traditional ways of making decisions and traditional ways of writing about those decisions. These corporations, all but one signatories to the Sullivan Principles, evolved a unique structure that allowed them to enter the debate on divestiture, yet minimize their rhetorical exposure. The limitations inherent in that new pattern became evident, however, in the mid-1980s as the debate became more intense and frustrating for executives and their corporations. The essay also examines the pivotal role of Leon Sullivan, the African American minister who organized these corporations in their anti-apartheid efforts, monitored their efforts, pushed them to do more, served as their rhetorical point man in opposition to divestiture, and helped define them as a discourse community. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""The two essays, “Pooling Resources Around the Lectern, One Heuristic Approach” and “The Problems That I Have With Writing”, written respectively by Professor Maria Curro Kreppel and her student Vincent Wu, address communication instruction at the undergraduate, senior level. This instruction occurs within the Mechanical Engineering Technology curriculum at the University of Cincinnati's College of Applied Science. From very different points of view, both essays focus on the process of developing technical communication skill. For Professor Kreppel, key elements in this process are faculty collaboration across disciplines and departments, and involvement of students as professionals in their field of study. For Mr. Wu, the essential elements are guidance and practice. He recommends expansion of composition instruction throughout his undergraduate program to provide more of both. Together, the essays address the sort of faculty-student dialog that supports not only communication skill development, but also development of collaborative undergraduate study across the curriculum. © 1988 IEEE""This article suggests how newspaper editors in developing countries can offer their readers articles on scientific subjects. The author discusses some possible sources of such articles. Among these are the international wire services, a staff member working part-time, contributions by professors or researchers of a local university or communicative graduate students, training of a young graduate who has sufficient education and talent to ″grow into″ the post of scientific-technological reporter. This last method, although the most expensive of the options proffered, also holds the most promise for a publication to develop a distinctive and possibly exemplary style of specialized journalism. Many of the winners of national prizes and UNESCO'S Kalinga Prize, awarded for excellence in science writing, began their careers in this manner. It should be borne in mind that even relatively simple technological changes, for example a new hybrid feed grain or an innovative energy source (such as biogas), usually has much more immediate impact on the lives of the inhabitants of developing countries than it does in the industrialized countries. Hence such innovations should be considered newsworthy.""Programs in technical and professional communication are continually challenged by issues of location and dislocation.

This article suggests that business communication educators can realize this potential through three pedagogical changes: timing the assignment to coincide with reflective phases in the learning cycle, incorporating rhetorical context, and promoting abstraction and generalization. With these adjustments, the genre becomes a unique opportunity among reflective-reflexive documents because of its pervasiveness, timeliness, and rhetorical significance. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""Although technical communication has traditionally positioned itself as a “service profession,” the work technical communicators actually do more closely resembles the complex leadership, management and subject matter work of a “creative” profession. Recent thinking about the practices and curricula of technical communication demonstrates the need to view technical communication as a complex profession that requires a range of skills that allow one to interact with subject matter experts and be subject matter experts ourselves, to manage projects and people, and to lead research and development activities. Technical communicators must be able to generate ideas to produce goods and services that create, teach, and drive technical innovation as well as inspire, design, and cultivate change.""We measured objective and subjective characteristics of 99 memoranda and derived indices of selected message characteristics (positive emphasis and you-attitude) and message reinforcers (benefits and threats). Employed business practitioners reacted to the memoranda as though the messages had been received at work and reported perceived message tone, commitment to comply with the message, and reader satisfaction. We used regression analysis to test several relationships predicted from a stimulus-response model. The study (a) provides some of the first empirical support for the concepts of positive emphasis and you-attitude; (b) supports the stimulus-response model developed in the paper, suggesting that it might merit additional research; (c) raises questions about current academic conceptions of positive emphasis and you-attitude; and (d) suggests additional research questions concerning, for example, the virtues of brevity and the effects of message organization. © 1995, Sage Publications.

The authors argue that a key indicator of an organization's effectiveness in communicating ""bad news"" messages is its organizational culture. Developing an organizational culture that values positive organizational behavior can transform the way that ""bad news"" messages are crafted and received in the workplace. In this article, the authors demonstrate how organizational leadership and practice from the positive organizational behavior perspective can assist with communicating ""bad news"" messages, particularly during organizational crises. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""One meaning of postmodernism is the recognition and inclusion of the previously excluded and suppressed. Recent developments of a generally humanistic nature in technical communication—the rhetoric of science, social constructionism, and feminist and ethicist critiques of science—are instances of such recognition. These developments deflate some traditional assumptions about and privileges associated with scientific and technical knowledge and practice, while they elevate previously denied aspects. Thus, surprisingly, postmodernism reveals itself in technical communication as the resurgence of humanism. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Though employing different methodologies, they saw similar outcomes. Through assessment of student reflections and discussions of course outcomes, both professors concluded that there is potential for collaborative service-learning projects between the two disciplines. This article discusses pedagogical approaches in the two courses, the theory and pedagogy on which the approaches are based, and practical ideas on how a collaborative professional writing/health studies service-learning project might be set up. Such ideas may provide a model for collaboration across disciplines. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Medical cartography became an important data visualization tool in the 19th century. In this article, the author argues that early yellow fever maps invoked power and authority over diseased space through their visual conventions and scientific authority as statistical graphics as well as by visually reinforcing underlying Western ideologies about disease, illness, and health. Further, the creation of these maps established a visual precedent for invoking this authority that continues today. As public health continues to move toward a global health perspective in the 21st century, understanding how mapping constructs and shapes knowledge about disease, illness, and health will become increasingly important. © The Author(s) 2015""Technical communication research has critically engaged with organizational trends toward flattened organizations like networks, horizontal arrangements, and adhocracies, assemblages that hybridize top-down management in favor of autonomous groups. There has been no engagement with a related but distinct trend: worker cooperatives. Co-ops promise similar advantages but are distinct as they claim to deliver what flat organizations promise: access to governance, empowerment, and autonomy. In this article, I survey literature on flattened organizations, apply technical communication theory to account for cooperative communication, and conclude with an analysis from a qualitative study at a cooperative site. © The Author(s) 2016.""In addition to reflecting the social and power relationships between the writer and the reader as well as the degree of imposition, politeness strategies in administrative writing also reflect the values of the organization. Operating in the egalitarian climate perpetuated in a university setting, administrators obscured their legitimate power when they wrote nonroutine memos to faculty. Hiding and de-emphasizing their empowerment by using indirectness, tentativeness, indebtedness, and personalization, academic administrators achieved a high level of politeness. This intensified politeness contrasts with the moderated politeness used in a corporation that openly accepts hierarchy and promotes efficiency. This study, therefore, offers a context-based approach to analyzing administrative writing, an approach that can be used to uncover discourse strategies in other organizational sites. © 1996 Sage Publications, Inc.""The use of PowerPoint (PPT)-based lectures in business classes across universities is ubiquitous yet understudied in empirical pedagogical research. The purpose of this empirical study was to ascertain whether significant differences exist between faculty and student perceptions with regard to PPT's impact on perceived learning, classroom interactions, and student behaviors. The results indicated that (a) students have a significantly less favorable overall view of PPT's influence on cognitive learning and classroom interaction than faculty members; (b) unlike faculty members, students do not believe that posting notes on the Web will decrease their motivation to attend class; and (c) both faculty members and students perceive that PPT has a favorable impact on notetaking quality, content recall during exams, emphasis on key lecture points, and holding student attention during class. The authors offer implications for instructors and future research. © 2006 by the Association for Business Communication.""PowerPoint presentations are often criticized for the excessive use of text on the slides. In a study of 97 academic scholars, we found that presenters indeed used substantially more text than is advised. Speaking anxiety was found to be related to the time spent on preparing and rehearsing, and time spent on rehearsing is related to the number of words on the slides. Anxious presenters appear to use PowerPoint slides as speaking notes. Presenters should be trained to overcome their speaking anxiety by means other than the abundant use of words on their slides. © 2016 by the Association for Business Communication Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.""The use of PowerPoint (PPT)-based lectures in business classes is prevalent, yet it remains empirically understudied in business education research. The authors investigate whether students in the contemporary business classroom view PPT as a novel stimulus and whether these perceptions of novelty are related to students' self-assessment of learning. Results indicate that the degree of novelty that undergraduate business students associate with PPT-based teaching significantly relates to their perceptions of PPT's impact on cognitive learning and classroom interaction. Students' views of PPT as a novel stimulus are also associated with their perception of specific constructive and dysfunctional classroom behaviors and attitudes. The authors discuss their findings and offer implications for instructors and researchers in business education. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Bad writing is bad business and bad manners. When the reader must do the thinking that the writer neglected to do, the result may be different from what the writer intended. The hard part of writing is to use words in a way that serves the writer's aim. This is hard work because thinking is hard work, but careful thinking ultimately saves time and trouble for everyone concerned. Use common, short, expressive words; avoid words with many meanings. Be direct, simple brief, vigorous, and lucid. Prefer the concrete to the abstract and the active voice to the passive.""The question of what makes technical communication a profession and its practicioners professionals is discussed.

In light of this development and the growing information economy, it is crucial that the public be well-informed, effective, and responsible regarding important technological issues. For this reason, undergraduate education, whether for technical or non-technical majors, must include an awareness of the complexity, ambiguity, and interestedness of the use of technical language and information. This is particularly important in communication involving public discourse and perceptions. I discuss here how I foster such awareness in my juniorlevel technical writing course for non-majors. We focus on the concept ""safe"" in relation to radiation and nuclear power. This is done in the overall context of making a recommendation for nuclear power as an energy source for the state of Florida for the next two decades, a realistic and urgent technical communication situation. Students see that standards and even the definitions of crucial terms shift depending on context and social circumstances, and that real-world choices involve trade-offs and balances between advantages and disadvantages. © 2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Revising instructions for clients of health care facilities provides students with valuable practice in good technical communication techniques: organizing information for maximum accessibility, analyzing the audience's needs, using formatting and graphics to enhance communication, and clarifying sentence structure and diction.

It also emphasizes the accountability of technical writers to the users of their documents.""The authors investigate the importance of instructor communication behaviors in a course on business communication, arguing that alignment between instructor behaviors and the precepts of the discipline has a pronounced effect on perceived instructor credibility in this field. Student evaluations were analyzed qualitatively for their comments on instructor communication behaviors and quantitatively for the ratings students gave their instructors. This suggests a relationship between the two. The authors outline two classroom exercises to help students develop best practice in business communication, while also enhancing instructors' credibility by showing how they apply best practice in their own documents. © 2012 Association for Business Communication.""Most technical communication practitioners conduct research throughout their careers. Yet, a survey of the Web sites of 114 undergraduate technical communication programs between September 2006 and April 2007 revealed that 65% (about two thirds) of these programs are providing minimal or no exposure to research instruction and therefore are not sufficiently preparing students to handle the types of research they will encounter in their upcoming careers. Given the disconnect between the centrality of research in the work that technical communicators do and the low presence of research instruction at the undergraduate level, academics need to look for ways to overcome institutional and other constraints in order to give research training greater priority in their undergraduate programs. © 2009 Sage Publications.""Although extensive research has been done on teaching emails and on the use of emails in organisations, little research exists about how to incorporate organizationalpractitioners' views as the voices of the community of social practice.

A content analysis of messages produced by 120 beginning managers revealed that while the managers overwhelmingly endorsed a non-directive style of communication, they expected compliance from the subordinate only when a directive/autocratic style of communication was utilized. The results indicate that conflict situations can be directly attributed to style of communication based on expectations of human behavior. © 1983, Sage Publications.

Participants consisted of 431 students enrolled in business communication courses during the 1995 spring semester at three state-supported universities in three southern states. Statistical analyses revealed that gender, keyboarding skill, age, socioeconomic status, and self-directedness are adequate predictors of computer anxiety in business communication students. Teaching strategies for reducing or eliminating computer anxiety in business communication classrooms are discussed.""The business communicator's ability to elicit a certain response from the receiver is intimately connected with his ability to predict reliably the effect of the encoded message.

We explored the respondents' preferences for either a word-processed or a handwritten message. The results indicate that (a) main effects and interactions involving hierarchical level, message length, message complexity, anticipated reaction, communication task, need for documentation, and communication across work shifts affect preferences for wordprocessed versus handwritten messages; (b) the cost control perspective can explain preferences for word-processed versus handwritten messages; and (c) scholars should distinguish between various types of written messages rather than grouping all written messages together in a single category. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Invariably these discussions elicit perceptions and attributions of the actor's intent and interpersonal style. This paper presents a new model, incorporating intent and style into four archetypes. The archetypes are discussed in detail as are implications for designing and conducting cultural-diversity training. © 1997, Sage Publications.

Based on many employers' concerns that students are not getting the kind of real-world preparation they need in the area of business communication, the article suggests some practical solutions and effective pedagogical techniques that will make the course more real-world oriented and, therefore, more useful for today's business graduate. It also suggests ways to prepare students more realistically and specifically for the kinds of communication tasks they will be expected to do in a corporate setting in their first jobs after graduation. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

This article describes an extended program for training graduate assistants to teach business and technical writing. The three-semester program includes a semester of apprenticeship teaching, followed by two semesters in which the graduate assistants teach their own classes. During the graduate assistants' first two semesters, they attend preparatory seminars on the teaching of pro fessional writing. The program emphasizes providing guidance and support for new teachers throughout their assistantship period, while encouraging the graduate assistants to develop their own teaching styles. © 1989, Sage Publications.

The implications of this project for teaching managerial communication to MBA students and recommended applications for integrating work world tasks into the curriculum are also discussed. © by the Association for Business Communication."This study resulted in a conceptual framework to facilitate decisions about rhetorical and linguistic choices for subordinates reporting to superiors. Soon-to-be new hires graduating from business schools in Singapore and the midwestern United States responded to reporting scenarios. Their responses were scored holistically on overall effectiveness. Analyses of subsamples revealed four issues where these students had difficulties reporting in writing: contribution, deference, ownership, and objectivity. An analytical tool incorporating these issues and textual alternatives was then used to score a large subsample. Correlations between the holistic scores and scores on the analytical tool suggest that the four issues are distinct yet complementary, with contribution on one side of a continuum and deference on the other: The finding that Singaporean respondents scored higher on deference than contribution, whereas the reverse was true for U.S. respondents, suggests the usefulness of the framework when used for cross-cultural teaching and research. © 2004 by the Association for Business Communication.""To improve college students' skills in resolving workplace conflict, the authors studied the types of workplace conflicts that students encounter with peers or supervisors in part-time or seasonal work and with whom they discuss these conflicts. The authors found that most students report conflicts that are process or relational in nature, with few students reporting task-oriented conflict. Nearly all students report discussing the conflict with third parties - individuals outside the organization and/or the conflict - and nearly all students find these discussions helpful in resolving or working through the conflict. Based on their literature review and research, the authors developed scenarios to help students ""read"" and resolve workplace conflicts. The scenarios use conversations with people outside the conflict - third-party discussions - to help students respond appropriately to the conflict. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Preparing students for the behavioral description, or situational, job interview that is becoming common in business requires two components. In addition to (a) improving students' cognitive skills (learning about the company, preparing questions and answers) and affective skills (dress, composure, delivery), it requires (b) developing students' ability to answer behaviorally based questions. Most textbooks focus on the first component. This article suggests ways to take typical interview questions, translate them to behavioral questions, and prepare illustrative responses. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Certain demographics within the user population (older adults, disabled persons, non-native speakers) may face serious challenges when trying to use self-service documentation. Technical communication educators should prepare students to function as user advocates for members of these groups. Technical communication students need a thorough understanding of the challenges that may interfere with an audience's ability to use websites and other online documentation. This article suggests ways to help students gain this understanding through course content and by structuring service-learning and virtual team projects in which students can put their newly-developed understanding into practice. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Technical communicators need to be prepared for the challenges of international communication. This tutorial focuses on the need for technical communication faculty to prepare students to be skilled intercultural communicators and to play a role on the translation team. The tutorial begins with a discussion of the importance of writing for translation in the international workplace and then presents specific assignments designed to instruct students in intercultural communication and give them experience writing for translation. In addition to introducing students to the cultural issues that impact the creation of documentation for international audiences, these assignments also serve to reinforce core skills recognized as vital to professional success in the field of technical communication. Taken together, these assignments can be used as the basis for a course in international technical communication. An appendix to the tutorial includes numerous resources available to faculty who want either to develop a course in international technical communication or to include some of the assignments in existing technical communication courses. © 2005 IEEE."Many companies fail to realize that foreign language capability seldom implies proficiency in translating technical matter. Proper preparation of documents in ″translatable English″ often requires as much time and money as did the preparation of the English version. This article offers solutions to some of the problems of translating an English technical document into a foreign language."Advances in information technology are drastically changing the profession of technical communication and the role of the technical communicator in developing and managing information. Educators must face the challenge posed by these advances to prepare students for the profession as it is now and as it will be in the future. One answer to this challenge is experiential learning theory, which places experience at the center of the learning process. © 1990 IEEE""Difficulty with writing may be attributable to lack of preparation. This article presents a worksheet which helps authors facilitate writing projects by identifying important preliminary considerations, the potential readers of the document, relationships of the writer to the audience and the document, the purpose of the document, and strategies to employ to achieve that purpose. Each of these categories is discussed in detail, in terms of the entries to be made on the form.

During the three-year experiment in managerial education, the faculty defined course objectives to meet the following challenges: student apathy and resistance to education; unproductive duplication among courses in the curriculum; inability of students to see the relationships between what they learn in various courses; inadequate communication skills; poor analytical and problem-solving abilities.""This teaching case presents the authors' experience planning, teaching, and evaluating a semester-long course within a computer science undergraduate program; the aim of this course was to develop soft skills that enable students to actively contribute within multicultural and transdisciplinary teams. Research question: How can an undergraduate-level course help computer science students better understand the multicultural and interdisciplinary scenarios that compose today's working environment? Situating the case: The literature review contextualizes the case as part of a broader group of literature concerned with curricular reforms that replace the traditional emphasis on memorization of fixed disciplinary knowledge with what have been called '21st Century Skills.' In addition, it builds a theoretical framework followed by the course that brings together Hofstede's Cultural Theory and Vygotsky's ideas regarding the social formation of the mind. Methodology: The researchers conducted two studies with a group of 62 students who participated in the course. The first one measured how students appropriated the concepts presented in the course and learning outcomes. The second one evaluated the students' perception of the course a year after they had enrolled in it. About the teaching case: Results show that the vast majority of students appropriate the concepts of the theoretical framework used throughout the course. In addition, most students perceive the courses' contribution to their professional lives positively-particularly regarding understanding cultural and transdisciplinary issues. A small group does not consider a course like the one proposed to be useful. Conclusions: The implication of this teaching case is that the ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences is something that can be addressed directly by a specifically designed course within a computer science curriculum (rather than exclusively being a secondary outcome of other courses). The limitations of the study are that it presents the authors' own teaching experience (therefore, it is not a third-party report) and that it uses pretesting and posttesting as an asessment tool for multicultural and transdisciplinary abilities. Future work would show how similar experiences could be conducted across other cultural scenarios and possible ways in which to engage the small group of students who do not consider the course useful. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Boilerplate paragraphs, pages, and even longer standard sections are materials taken from one writing and used with little or no change in another. Such materials can save time, cut costs, help to meet deadlines, and at times raise quality. This article outlines the advantages and disadvantages of using boilerplate in preparing long documents and suggests applications and guidelines for the proper use of boilerplate. It also proposes diagnostic questions and prescriptions for ensuring that off-the-shelf materials are accurate and up to data.""One of the more effective techniques for developing presentations of ideas, particularly for management, is to try to anticipate all possible questions and objections to the idea and then build into the presentation the answers or solutions to those questions or problems. Often an idea ″sells″ better if others are allowed or encouraged to become contributors and reasonable revisions or modifications are warmly accepted. Visuals are usually beneficial to any presentation, and an extemporaneous - but not unrehearsed - presentation is dynamic and flexible. Further advice on preparation and delivery is included.""This paper provides a brief description of the key points an engineer or scientist must consider when preparing for a technical presentation. Planning, organization, construction, and presentation methodology are all explored in a manner to allow a speaker to review presentation material and style and to improve any areas which appear to be weak. Among particular items discussed are: word selection, meaningless verbal interjection (e. g. , ″OK″ , ″you know″ ), voice control and variation, gestures (appropriate or distracting) and visual aids.""Point-of-purchase advertising (POP) is responsible for half of the purchase decisions made in the store. Because of: 1) the influence of POP on the sale of technical consumer products and the economy; 2) our need to understand trends that shape technical and business communication; 3) the intermedial nature of POP (where spoken and written words work with place, visual image, physical structures, and multimedia integrated marketing campaigns); and 4) its theatrical and local nature, we need both a situated and theoretical exploration of POP. Drawing upon three months' participant observation in advertising, I describe a POP composing process in an integrated marketing campaign. Cognitive responses to layout and the interrelation of rhetorical canons are considered for preparing communication for a marketplace that is three-dimensional variegated, noisy, and peripatetic.""This study explored strengths and limitations of table formatting choices by engaging twenty-eight participants in information searches in online tables, presented on a small-screen interface (Palm IIIc). Table length across conditions was held constant at three screens long (24 rows total) but varied from one to three screens wide (approximately 35, 70, and 105 characters per line). Target information was positioned in either the upper left, lower left, upper right, or lower right quadrants. Data collected were time on task, error rate, and level of participants' confidence in their answers. Experimenters found that increased horizontal scrolling imposed the heaviest burden on information search. This study supports restricting table widths to one screen on handheld computers. If necessary, however, tables can go to two screens wide without critical detriment to usability. While ruled line formatting is slightly better than interface character in providing visual support for the burden of horizontal scrolling, neither formatting option adequately compensates for the added burden.""In the author's experience, the speaker often overlooks the fact that in order to present technical material in so short a time and to such a large audience, the visual aids (slides or viewgraphs) must be very thoughtfully prepared. Frequently, engineers and scientists shortchange this important reporting of their work - often the main technical payoff of their professional labor. Two principles incorporated in visual aids for technical talks can prevent many typical negative audience reactions. The speaker must ″put himself into the audience″ and be concerned with the legibility and the comprehensibility of the materials he prepares for projection. A simple guide for legibility is that any text within a one-foot frame must be readable without optics from a distance of ten feet. Comprehensibility is guided by limiting each frame to the expression of only one idea.""Hypermedia, the facility for presenting information as a combination of text, pictures, animation, sound, and full-motion video, provides exciting new opportunities for presenting information to our audiences. It may also, however, place additional cognitive load on them and may change the way they process the information presented to them. Those who write for hypermedia applications may need to change the way they look at the writing process, and those who teach writing may need to reconsider what they teach and what they choose to emphasize. Additionally, teachers who use hypermedia materials may need to be sensitive to students ways of approaching and using the material. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Problems addressed are lack of excitement, poor control of time, unreadable visuals, bewildering complexity, poor question conduct, and abusing an invitation.""Conducting a successful technical seminar requires careful preparation. Pre-seminar planning includes (1) outlining the material, (2) developing much more material than is expected to be needed, and (3) arranging comfortable and appropriate facilities. At the beginning of the seminar there should be a topical outline and plans should be announced to take a break between topics or at least hourly. After the presentation, time should be allowed not only for questions and answers but also for an evaluation to help prepare for future seminars.""Personal communication is the most effective way of getting your viewpoint across. The skills that support effective speaking are information control, physical self-control, and dialog direction (for question-and-answer sessions).

The study reviewed the current production and dissemination of information published in the company's journals, monographs, and books. The result of this pilot survey will be a factor determining whether to continue to publish the material in its current format and whether this material can continue to be utilized throughout the secondary journal publishing field.""Tables and figures are an integral part of the medium of communication of science and technology. An analysis of tables and figures, relying heavily on Euclidean terms (point, line and plane) explains something of their power - their ability to display with clarity large amounts of data, complex data relationships, and intricate three-dimensional configurations. Analysis also clarifies the mutual dependence of tables and figures and their accompanying texts. Additionally, analysis makes clear the semantic gap between tables and graphs, on the one hand, and illustrations, on the other.""This annotated bibliography discusses over 120 print and online resources related to Web accessibility. It lists and describes resources that offer practical advice on how to implement accessibility, particularly in relation to the WCAG 1.0 and Section 508 standards. It also summarizes the findings of empirical studies that have examined Web site accessibility via automated tests, such as Bobby, and studies that have gauged user performance with assistive technologies, such as screen readers. The bibliography lists forums for discussing accessibility with other practitioners and researchers, and it cites sources for news and events related to accessibility. The bibliography concludes with a short discussion of trends in accessibility research.""Three formats for presenting a number of similar procedures in printed instructions were compared in an experiment: separate lists, an integrated list, and a table. Participants had to operate a device on the computer screen, following procedures that were presented in one of these three formats. The integrated list format and the table format were expected to provide an overview of the features common to the similar procedures, which would help incidental learning of the procedures. However, the experiment did not yield such results. None of the formats scored significantly better than the other in the augmentation of incidental learning. Since instructions in integrated list format take more time to read in the beginning than the other formats, the integrated list format can be considered as the least favorable format.""This paper presents the results of a survey of both business and aca demic leaders on the question of what communication skills and prac tices are most important in the world outside the classroom.

The paper argues that managerial monitoring of e-mail is ethically questionable because of its potential to violate privacy rights. After examining the legal guidelines related to e-mail monitoring, the article explores the ethical considerations surrounding this type of monitoring. Privacy issues and implications for management are addressed. The paper also offers suggestions for organizations that choose to monitor employees' e-mail. © 1995 IEEE.""The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of research and engineering has combined with soaring document costs to increasingly limit the private information center's ability to acquire appropriate documents for contextual screening or direct use. More photocopies, electronic copies, and translations will therefore be required. Such ready document access is also vital to national goals because over 50 percent of even government-funded research and development is performed by private industry. Private industry information centers thus feel strongly that their users' needs must be included in any solutions to the ″copyright problem″ . What they are after, however, is a ″fair access″ that will still adequately fund vital publishers and information services.""Problem areas in science news coverage were identified as part of a survey of the accuracy of science news reporting in newspapers. Mail questionnaires and newspaper clippings were sent to the major sources cited in the articles. Common problem areas in science writing were identified by examining the comments scientists made on the questionnaires. Specifically, seven problem areas are discussed: finding angles, writing leads, quoting accurately, using language correctly, interpreting technical conclusions properly, avoiding sensationalism, and using the words ″cure″ and ″breakthrough″ .""Computer security has long been a problem for data-processing organizations, and effective measures are gradually evolving to meet the threats to data stored in computer systems. Text-processing organizations have not paid as much attention to security, except in government defense and other contracting, but they should.

The potential security risks associated with a computer installation can be classified as follows: Natural disasters, such as flood, wind, and fire; Terrorism; Computer theft; Weakness in software design; Honest errors.""Teachers of intercultural business communication may want to consider using problem-based learning (PBL), an instructional approach that places learners in problem-solving situations, that is, students are presented with messy and complex real-life problems that provide a context for learning concepts and developing skills. This article describes how ill-structured communication problems that emerge in intercultural business relationships in internationalizing small- or medium-sized enterprises are used to provide a context for learning. It explains how these problems are tackled by learners through the implementation of PBL in four stages: problem identification, information acquisition, information analysis, and problem resolution. Finally, it discusses the reactions of the students, external participants, and instructors to the PBL approach. © 2008 Sage Publications.""The paper describes a systematic approach to preparing presentations that uses a four-step problem-solving method familiar to most professionals. Step 1, understanding the problem, involves analyzing the speaker's purpose, the character of the audience, and the demands of the situation. Step 2, devising a plan, consists of selecting a strategy to integrate information from the first step with the speaker's knowledge of the subject. Step 3, carrying out the plan, uses conventional techniques of organization, explanation, and visual representation to compose a draft of the presentation. Step 4, examining the solution, compares the draft with the plan and modifies the presentation in response to feedback.""Many short reports are not useful because they lack a framework for logical organization. Since these short reports often deal with ″case studies″ of a particular problem and its solution, rather than with full-fledged scientific investigations, the scientific method is not very useful as an organizational framework. An eight-step problem-solving model is presented that can be successfully used for organzing the short report.""Objectives of a professional technical journal for an audience interested in a field where both mathematical theory and practical developments are of interest are discussed along with some of the general problems and possible procedures involved in obtaining, evaluating, and selecting appropriate papers for publication. Although editorial management of journals for a specific field of interest is emphasized, many of the principles involved should be generally applicable. Some of these pertain to procurement of material; record keeping; obligations to authors, associate editors, and readers; obtaining meaningful reviews; and criteria for acceptance or rejection of papers.""More and more speakers are making presentations in countries abroad, and many do not appreciate the additional factors that this involves. Barriers to communication for listeners with English as a second language include different meanings for the same words, failure to understand idioms and abbreviations, differences in culture and national background, and lack of familiarity with accents. The most effective aid to understanding is to speak slowly. There are additional considerations when using simultaneous translation, in particular, uninterrupted use of the microphone. The article includes 20 points to be noted when speaking abroad.""The author, a senior civil engineer with the National Capital Development commission in Canberra, Australia, comments on communication problems in planning and development pertaining to his work with the Commission.

The journals are expected to provide items required for current awareness as well as data of an archival nature. As a consequence, decisions concerning the subject coverage, formats, and packaging of journals are also complex, particularly in view of the impact of these decisions on the economics of journal publication. The factors involved are presented and their effect upon the future of primary journals is considered."The corporate procedure writer has the unenviable task of forcing change. Writing the procedure is only a small part of the job - most of it consists in interacting with those in the corporation who are governed by the procedures. The writer must know something about the personalities of the people affected by the changes. This article categorizes these personalities and explains the tools that the procedure writer uses in performing his difficult task."'Policy and procedure writing' is a genre of applied literature familiar to many who have worked in large-to-medium sized businesses and institutions and, even more, to those employed by government. Procedure manuals, narrowly conceived, implement institutional policy as it affects more than one department. Such writing requires detailed procedural auditing, composing job instructions, coordinating paperflow and forms use, as well as general operational, financial, and information-processing systems analysis. Resulting procedures serve as a form of company 'legislation' settling interactions between departments, in an ongoing process of updating and managerial decision-making which creates a promising career possibility for the technical writer."Reports results of a case study of white paper readers at an engineering consulting firm  Provides a theoretical framework to aid in understanding how white papers are read."The author questions the lack of emphasis on process in business writing texts. The author outlines the process of business writing, involving prewriting, drafting, revision, and editing. Aside from the writing aspect of these activities, they also force the student to develop problem solving skills. The author looks at ""Communicating Through Letters and Reports,"" by C.W. Wilkinson, Peter B. Clarke, and Dorothy C. Wilkinson, evaluating its usefulness for teachers interested in emphasizing writing strategies. The author states that writing strategies might be more useful to students than teaching process.""The product vs. process controversy enters the Business Writing classroom concerning how class time is spent teaching writing. A product-oriented approach works on the assumption that students already know a great deal about their subjects and about how to write. Class time is spent on lecturing and discussing assigned readings, mostly giving directions for formats and organizational plans. Students are then assigned to write a paper based on their ability to comprehend and assimilate these directions. Such an approach tends to ignore the complexities of the writing process and often yields disappointing results. In contrast, a process-oriented approach devotes class time to small group discussion, collaboration, audience analysis, peer evaluation, multiple drafts, with emphasis on revision and on extensive planning. These are techniques which practicing writers use to produce professional papers. Much more time is devoted to how to write than to what formal or organizational plan the student should use. Such an approach impresses students with the complexities of writing in the professions. Students leaving a process-oriented Business Writing course enter the professional world with a better preparation for the realities of writing on the job. © 1987, Sage Publications.

In the design stage the writer sets the logic of the presentation, tailors the content to the audience, ensures that the language is understandable, and plans graphics to reduce the burden of reading. Reviewing, testing, editing, and revising are the post-design steps. Overall, document design is a recursive process.""These four early-1980's texts used in college freshman composition courses emphasize that the writing process includes a continuing series of recursive activities and decisions. The goal is to achieve a well-composed product--fiction or nonfiction--adapted to the intended audience. Three of these books introduce the composing process in the first chapter; one, in the second chapter. Depending on how these authors group the activities, the process has from 3 to 5 stages. Though names and content of the stages may differ, the total writing process for all tasks is similar. Basically, it includes: preparing (with focus on purpose, audience, fact-gathering, sorting); organizing (by whatever outlines are desirable for the particular task); writing drafts with appropriate ideas, words, sentences, paragraphs, order; revising according to standards of correct style, documentation, grammar, content, mechanics; and proofreading for accuracy in the final product. Their other chapters discuss details of the process activities. These books contain short examples; one shows also a complete product. Exercises in two texts total usually 1 to 4 pages in each chapter; the other two have no exercises.""This article examines the theoretical background for a process-based pedagogy and describes a possible course based on process. Process pedagogy is founded on the premise that knowing how to compose results in better writers than simply knowing what to compose. Theoretical background on process is presented. A sample progression for a semester-long course includes a description of the writing process with an overview and the phases in the process, and an application of the description to various assignments. Phases in the process are discussed, with an extended example (an instructional brochure). © 1987, Sage Publications.

Results suggest that process variables (the types of resistance offered by subordinates) are the most important influence on managerial choice of compliance messages. Reasoning was the most frequently employed strategy, and its use was associated with high levels of formalization in organizations. Power was an important influence only on the use of assertiveness, probably because high power over subordinates lowers the costs of using assertiveness so that benefits of use outweigh costs. Other variables had little impact. The findings support a functional rather than a “causal” model of com pliance message selection in organizations. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Good business writing, grows out of an understanding of process, but it requires a formulation of it that cannot be reconciled with the pedagogical theories, assumptions, and techniques of current process writing.""Wikis enable large, diverse groups of writers to effectively collaborate online. Although Wikipedia is the best-known wiki, businesses are increasingly using wikis to build documents and resources for internal use. Although many teachers of technical communication are interested in integrating wikis into their syllabi, assessment is difficult. Assessments based on traditional assignments fail because they do not focus on the social nature of wikis.

It discusses the differences between literary and technical editing, and defines the facets of editing that are of primary concern to the literary editor and to the technical editor. It emphasizes the need for both types of editing at different stages of manuscript development, regardless of whether each type is done by different people or by the same person at different times. In short, the literary editor is primarily concerned with things involving the language and mechanics of writing and producing a document, while the technical editor is primarily concerned with the document's technical content and how well it is presented to the intended audience.""The author maintains that in many components, product specifications written by or for a single department fail to meet the overall company needs. He argues that all such documentation should be structured to allow easy traceability of important product information to the authorizing source, as well as early verification that the end product will be what was originally intended.""This case study examined employeesa' perceptions about the types of information management could productively communicate through electronic communication to augment face-to-face contact with employees. The benefits of effective face-to-face communication between managers and staff are widely appreciated; however, the costs associated with this mode of communication require organizations to make decisions about when scarce resources should be allocated for face-to-face communication and when the alternative, less costly resource of electronic communication could be substituted. The study determined that employees perceived human resource information that is private (confidential), personal, or sensitive as critical to receive through face-to-face contact. Employees perceived that information not deemed confidential-meeting times, training times, policy changes, system problems, and information with numerous details-were just as productive and some even critical to receive through e-mail. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Although academy-industry partnerships have been a subject of interest in professional communication for many years, they have barely been considered in terms of globally networked learning environments (GNLEs). This empirical case study of an academy-industry partnership, in which the authors participated, examines the opportunities and challenges in applying GNLE practices to the design of a corporate engineering communication workshop. Using genre-ecology modeling as the analytical framework, the study demonstrates how the pedagogical processes considered for inclusion in such a workshop may be embedded in a network of institutional genres, some of which are associated with strong regulating controls. The findings from this study have implications for those who are interested in applying GNLE practices in workplace contexts and for those interested in using a principled framework for representing the work of such partnership activities. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""This article offers productive usability as a usability approach that focuses on the usefulness of civic Web sites. Although some sites meet traditional usability standards, civic sites might fail to support technical literacy, productive inquiry, collaboration, and a multidimensional perspective-all essential ingredients for citizen-initiated change online. In this article, we map productive usability onto broader philosophies of usability and offer a framework for rethinking usability in civic settings and for teaching productive usability. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.""The Graphic Arts Department of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has used computer graphics for production work since 1979. From the beginning the computer graphics project has been subjected to cost/benefit analysis. As the system has evolved and the work has gotten more complex, the methods used to measure productivity have changed. This paper discusses what productivity enhancements have been gained, how productivity is measured in this changing environment, and what the present trends in productivity indicate for the future.""To examine the attitudes and perspectives of individuals in successful companies who manage technical communicators with a specific focus on the products and processes that make up the bulk of their work. Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews. Results: This research helped to further explain the relationship between what technical communicators produce and how these products function in situating or framing their producers in relation to other subfields/related disciplines, such as UX design, information design, knowledge management, usability, and information architecture. Conclusion: While there is general agreement among the managers that the role of the technical communicator has to expand, there is no one clear agreed-upon strategy. Some companies are obtaining success using Agile methodology, while others are finding that this methodology, while stressing adaptability, is not easy to introduce. Corporate cultures do not change overnight. Still, integrated teams, a key component of Agile, are taking hold in most cultures. Equally important, the shift away from writing documents to directing content is well underway. The key now, as it has been for decades, is for technical communicators to highlight their value and make their contributions more visible. © 2015, Technical Communication.

Experiments are designed to allow role-playing by both student and instructor, so that work is conducted and findings are presented within hypothetical contexts of realistic interactions between industrial firms and their clients. Through role-playing, students learn to analyze an audience to state objectives clearly. Role-playing reinforces the realistic training students receive in cooperative education programs by allowing them to experience the pressures of professional communication responsibilities. It also narrows the gap between classroom and industry by focusing student's attention on the results and organizational implications of their work as well as on theory and method. Both written and oral communications are discussed.""To make the technical communication program at SUNY Institute of Technology at Utica/Rome successful and to give students an advantage of working with practicing professionals, the faculty thought it wise to add an advisory board composed of professionals, managers, and others associated with profes sional and technical communication.

It is believed that the thematic structure creates both dynamic and contemporary contexts for writing and research along with enough freedom to pursue individual student interests. The result is a higher degree of intrinsic motivation for the assignments. The course is a collaborative effort between an English department and a school of engineering designed to both improve curriculum and provide more assessment data for engineering accreditation. Among the criteria from the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the ""ability to communicate effectively."" Along with satisfying this criterion, the course discussed in this paper details how to capture data in support of an additional four of ABET's criteria known as ""a-k."" After highlighting these ABET criteria and giving an overview of the structure of the course, the paper details each theme, including their respective readings and assignments. This new course was taught for the first time in the 2006-2007 academic year, and the paper closes by weighing the outcomes and implications of adopting a similar format. The current version of the syllabus and reading list for this course are included in this paper. © 2008 IEEE.""At first glance, there seems to be very little in common between professional communication and a nineteenth-century detective story. However, there is a strong link between Poe's ""The Purloined Letter"" (E.A. Poe, 1975) and the successful practices of today's professional communicators, particularly technical writers and editors. In the story, Poe's writing methodology and his main character's investigative advice both offer useful guidelines for successful professional communication. ""The Purloined Letter"" is a formulaic detective story about Dupin, a witty detective who solves the case of a stolen letter, a case previously unsolved by the French police. Dupin uses intimate knowledge of human logic and reasoning to find the stolen letter. His method is contrasted with that of the French police who had spent months unsuccessfully searching for it. Dupin's means of finding the letter is a series of significant courses of action that can be applied to effective professional communication strategies. The article summarizes Dupin's advice and how it can be applied to effective technical communication today.""Phatic refers to the rhetorical function of creating effective communication channels, keeping them open, and establishing ongoing and fruitful relationships, all of which are vital in the age of digital rhetoric, social media, and global intercultural exchange. In this realm, the professional communicator functions less as an originator of new information and more as a space designer, a facilitator of others’ online interactions, a curator of user-generated content, and a communication leader. The phatic function—especially relevant to online interactions such as virtual teamwork, intercultural communication, and user help forums—deserves significant attention as a primary purpose for professional communication. © 2017 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article describes a beginning research partnership between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and two Mexican universities, the Universidad de Quintana Roo (UQROO) and Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, that has developed and implemented an environment merging the pedagogies of English as a foreign language (EFL) and writing across the curriculum (WAC).

In a high-context culture such as that of Korea, nunch'i governs verbal and nonverbal communication to such an extent that westerners who are not familiar with its basic concepts can fall prey to serious miscommunication. This paper defines and describes nunch'i, providing illustrations of its proper usage in professional communication situations. © 1996 IEEE.""This article describes techniques for finding and for preparing for consulting work in communications. It explores procedures essential to workshops, in-plant and extension seminars, free-lance and staff-writing and editing, scientific and medical journalism, reviewing and abstracting and translating services, and several of the communication links established by new federal legislation.""Professional communication is a growing component of English departments and other communication programs. Yet, in most cases, the term professional communication is used as a catchall term for various types of workplace and occupational writing. As such, professional communication, as it is currently framed, seems to have little to do with professionals or the process of professionalization. This article calls for a more thorough examination of the concept of professional communication by reviewing (1) the ways in which researchers have used this term to describe the rhetoric of professionals who communicate, (2) the democratic and knowledge-based contradictions between rhetorical scholarship and professional powers, and (3) the current challenges facing professional workers, including deprofessionalization and proletarianization. The author argues that if professional communication research and teaching are to remain prominent parts of academic programs, researchers, theorists, teachers, and students must become more aware of conceptual issues that inform and define professional work.""This study focuses on dominant terms whose usage generates a specific identity in the craft beer industry: revolution and crafty. Actors who engage these terms—brewers, writers, and consumers—create a narrative about the industry that gives craft beer a professional identity.

Research questions: (1) How do global managers currently use and experience professional virtual worlds (Virtual Worlds) as a communication media for global work? and (2) How do these Virtual Worlds support global and professional communication in a geographically distributed context? Literature review: We reviewed Virtual World literature in the area of social sciences, education, and games. Little research has been conducted on Virtual Worlds for workgroups. But those studies support the assumption that Virtual Worlds are suitable for global distributed work as a collaboration and communication medium. Methodology: With an explorative and qualitative interview research approach, we conducted 47 semi-structured interviews with virtual world vendors, researchers, and managers using virtual worlds in their work. Data were analyzed based on Grounded Theory Analysis methods. Results and conclusions: The results show four different use cases applied for professional Virtual Worlds: small team meetings, trainings, community building, and conferences. Furthermore, our findings confirm Virtual World literature that states that the professional Virtual World as a communication and collaboration tool supports geographically distributed work as well as visualization and learning in a global context. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Professional technical writers have a role to play as instructors in technical writing programs, as they are experts in the tools, procedures, and policies of a professional documentation department.

Methods: Analysis of literature, including social media, and conversations with our thought leaders. Results: A third aspect of establishing professional identity is described: emerging technological, sociocultural, and political currents. The ideological and economic processes were addressed in Technical Communication 58, 2011. Conclusions: Technical communicators are emerging as active players in today's dynamic enterprise with integrated skill sets to navigate rapidly changing work structures. Roadblocks are still present.""To determine what aspects of writing are most important in a business context, previous researchers have often surveyed business professionals as well as business faculty. We recently took a different approach. We asked business professionals to critique and evaluate a set of writing samples. We then asked business faculty to evaluate the same samples, and we analyzed the results from the two groups. We found that professionals judge writing on different criteria than do faculty. While both groups emphasize organization, professionals also emphasize wording/style, content, and sentence structure more than do faculty, who emphasize conciseness, spelling/grammar, appearance, and purpose. In addition, professionals are signifi cantly more lenient in assigning grades than are faculty and spend less time in evaluating the writing. In general, business professionals judge papers more on substance (content) and less on style (mechanics) than do business faculty. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Usually a dictionary lookup procedure is combined with a ″logical hyphenation program″ which bases its decisions on the recognition of certain characters, strings of characters, or patterns of vowels and consonants. The described program is such a logical routine. It is based on the word division rules of Webster's New International Dictionary and recognizes prefixes, suffixes, and other letter combinations which require special processing, including strings which are likely to belong to accented syllables. Otherwise, normal processing consists of finding the character pair corresponding to the greatest interruption of spoken sound, using a prestored table which contains a ″break value″ - for each possible pair of characters.""The article discusses the use of programmed instruction in teaching business communication courses. Programming is defined as the process of constructing instructional material in such a way that it allows a student to master a subject. Students are given small pieces of information as instruction progresses toward more and more complex materials. A study is presented in which the principles of terminal behavior, initial behavior, gradual progression, stimulus support, fading, and experimental program construction were learned and applied. Teachers reported becoming frustrated in the classroom because of adjusting from a traditional role as active leader in a face-to-face situation changes to the role of counselor.""The authors report the findings of programmatic research on the perceived seriousness of communication barriers to learning across five pedagogies. The theoretical basis and general method are related. Consistent findings over five studies have uncovered a generalized ordering of specific concerns as well as dimensionality of learning barriers. Discipline-specific differences do not appear to be present, but method and male-female differences are evident. The findings suggest that pedagogical research bound by discipline or univer sity may be more generalizable than previously thought. © 1988, Sage Publications.

The success of these tools comes not simply from their use, but from the teachers recognition that he/she is functioning as a supervisor or project leader. I believe it is not enough to tell students, “Here, go write a collaborative report,” OR even, to tell the students, “here, go write a collaborative report following these plans.” Rather, we must provide the structure and the leadership to foster that collaborative work. © 1991, Sage Publications.

The same project teams performed three separate projects involving the development of an HTML website, the development of a local-area network (LAN), and the development of blueprints for a wide-area network (WAN). Each of the projects exposed groups to a different level of complexity. The results of the study indicated differences in group information sharing, group communication focus, and group gatekeeping activities. In each of these cases, the groups had greater communication with the less complex project task, the HTML project. The study did not find significant differences in group communication concerned with member withdrawal or group conflict.""To help alleviate issues of free-riding and conflicts in team projects, this study proposes the systematic incorporation of project management methods to introduce a process-oriented approach to and a critical praxis in team projects. We examined how the systematic use of project management methods influenced students' performance in team projects. The findings demonstrate that such an approach enables the documentation and evaluation of and reflection on both individual and team work. Our findings indicate that project management tools enhance team member accountability and help reduce free-riding. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Much of the talk about the information revolution so far is just that—talk. A provocative mix of promises, hopes and hyperbole, some of it will come true over time. Most of it will not. Technology is moving at ever-increasing speeds, and predictions about technology are accelerating even faster. Yet practical needs and wants rarely keep pace. The purpose of this paper is to explore the disparity between the promises and possibilities of the information revolution. It examines the factors that traditionally affect new technologies, and the role of end-users in affecting outcomes. © 1995 IEEE.""Today's managers expect employees to be able to contribute not just their labor but also their analysis and ideas, yet little training is provided for writing the major document that contains such ideas: the internal proposal. Business and academic textbooks, as well as academic courses, focus almost entirely on external propos als, which are most appropriate in areas such as consulting and sales. The internal proposal (also known as the justification report), on the other hand, is applicable for almost any student's future career. It provides an opportunity for students to develop the competence and confidence to express their ideas in the workplace, encouraging them to demonstrate awareness and initiative, utilize problem-solving skills, and create a persuasive strategy. Because students are motivated to com plete this real-world assignment, it also inspires some of their best work. © 2002, Sage Publications.

Currently, an estimated 12 million men, women, and children benefit from the Bank's integrated financial and social-promotional services. In this paper, I analyze Grameen's microcapitalistic philosophy and practice, its approach to organizing microenterprises, and its adaptability as a model to different cultural contexts, reviewing two of its international replication experiences. Grameen's microcapitalism seeks freedom of individual thought and action for the poor by giving them access to credit as a fundamental human right. Grameen's combined organizing approach allows its employees and clients to create and share norms that prompt them to pursue concertive action for change. The two international replication experiences described here underline the adaptability of the Grameen model to different cultures and the centrality of cultural dynamics to the shaping of organizational communication policies and practices. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article explores how marketing communication in traditional media and new media leads people to the Web sites of technical communication companies, consultants, and independent contractors, and to what extent these Web sites then contribute to recruiting clientele. Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 technical communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services, and then interviewed half of these survey respondents. Results: Aside from drawing in a moderate portion of clientele directly, these Web sites also helped recruit clientele who originated through such traditional marketing communication as referrals and networking. Yet such traditional communication tended not to be as useful in leading people to these sites as newmedia communication, such as search engines and e-mail. Marketing communication's usefulness in leading people to a Web site is associated with that Web site's levels of success in recruiting clientele. Conclusion: A Web site's efficacy may thereby depend in part on the support of other communication, especially communication sharing a similar medium.""Communication efforts of the United States government to stimulate export development in the private sector are often unsuccessful because they are not specifically designed to overcome the attitudinal and informa tional constraints of nonexporters.

The author explains that she has begun to speak to her students about her own struggles as a writer, outlining the various strategies that she employs to accomplish certain writing tasks. Her students are directed to texts by both Donald Murray and Peter Elbow, which further reinforce the practice of freewriting, journaling, writing drafts, rewriting, and revision. Students begin to understand that professional writers encounter the same challenges and employ some of the same strategies as student writers in order to complete a final piece.""An employee's failure to differentiate himself or herself from the perceived attitudes of another is at the heart of much stress in organizations. The world of family systems psychology identifies a dysfunctional process, called psychological fusion, which stems from insufficient self-definition by an individual and results in a dependency upon others to meet an innate need to feel accepted. People suffering from psychological fusion perceive any criticism as a threat, making it impossible for them to receive the critical feedback that is necessary for growth. To experience intrinsic motivation, people require a sense of relative self-determination and competence. This paper argues that much as employers take an interest in such emotional health issues as substance abuse and stress, they should also address psychological fusion; the paper offers methods for dealing with this interpersonal communications issue.""Findings from psychological research reveal certain implications for rules of summarization. Some of these rules have been empirically verified, as has the finding that expert summarizers can verbalize the low-level rules they use, but not the high-level rules. The proposed rule for the selection of topic sentence (which was not used by experts) is questioned in light of the common confounding of topic sentence and main idea. The findings show that student readers share another erroneous assumption: the main idea is always in paragraph-initial position. Other, counter-intuitive results reveal, for example, that main idea can be extracted from simple technical prose without deep understanding, and that this can be done by computer. These findings can form the basis of class exercises and discussion, which aim to focus students' attention on their own summarizing procedures, and on the properties of texts.""Working from the premise that public input is essential to science policy deliberations, we analyze how two recent works of public communication about climate change (An Inconvenient Truth and Climate Change Show) draw on the rhetorical resource of apocalyptic narrative explanation to promote scientific fluency and inspire citizen engagement in the issues. By weaving together the proofs of ethos, logos, and pathos within a framework of cultural rationality, these narratives illustrate available means of persuasion for stimulating the public's informed participation in science policy discussions. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""Environmental impact studies often enlist professional communicators to develop and implement public engagement plans and processes. However, few detailed reports of these public engagement plans exist in either scholarly venues or government reports. This case reviews one public engagement project in transportation planning as implemented by one professional communications firm. Research questions: 1) What communication and engagement strategies do the consultants employ in their public engagement process? 2) How do professional communicators design engagement for diverse citizen groups? Situating the case: A number of cases have revealed the ways professional and technical communicators integrate participatory or user-centered design strategies in public engagement projects. These cases suggest that professional and technical communicators are uniquely positioned to develop ethical and effective public engagement plans for environmental impact studies. Professional and technical communicators are further prepared for this work because of their knowledge about theories of intercultural communication and rhetorical theories of delivery. Methodology: This case was studied over the course of 1.5 years using qualitative research methods, including observations, interviews, and textual analysis. About the case: This case reviews the work of one particular public engagement firm, VTC Communications, as they planned and implemented public engagement in one environmental impact study. This environmental impact study team was tasked with determining the best way to accommodate the increase in rail traffic the city anticipated with the development of the high-speed rail. The public's input was needed to fulfill environmental impact statement (EIS) requirements and to fully understand the community concerns regarding the increased traffic, noise, vibrations, and family/business displacements. VTC Communications was hired to conduct this portion of the environmental impact study, and their work included the development of a range of deliverables and events. Conclusions: This case provides an overview of the process of developing public engagement plans, the deliverables designed, as well as the key goals that guided the development of public engagement. My case suggests that effective public engagement can address intercultural concerns by developing projects that are adaptable, multimodal, and dialogic. © 2016 IEEE.""Many engineering students are unprepared to address public policy issues because their education is fragmented: they tend to focus narrowly on technical solutions to closed-ended problems in engineering and science classes; they don’t see the connections between engineering and public policy in their humanities and social sciences courses; and they don’t see how technical communication relates to either engineering or public policy. But technical solutions to public problems which fail to address their political aspects are not solutions at all. The authors discuss a multidisciplinary approach to professional communication which seeks to mend this fragmentation. In the 4-semester Engineering Practices Introductory Course Sequence (EPICS) program, students learn professional communication skills by working in groups on “real world” projects for which industry and government professionals serve as clients. These open-ended problems involve numerous nontechnical constraints, including a variety of public policy issues. Communication skills and the important connections among competent technical analysis, effective communication, and effective policy formation are reinforced and extended in the policy analysis course and senior design sequence, where students are required to consider and articulate the public policy implications of complex technological projects. © 1991 IEEE""In this article Professor Morton suggests that Public Relations should mean more to a firm than keeping a specialized staff of public relations workers.

The focal points for comparison are the two accident reports issued by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - reports that attempted (and failed) to persuade the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to change a problematic policy about rail communication alongside its technology for rail communication. The central question the article asks is, How can rhetorical theory help explain the CTA's inaction, which ultimately led to property damage, injury, and death? Classical and constructivist approaches, emphasizing rational deliberation between equals, on one hand, and the social construction of technical knowledge between professionals, on the other, offer plausible explanations for what went wrong. But only the materialist approach appears capable of discerning the ideological nature of the CTA's resistance to the NTSB's recommendations.""This study concerns itself with the public speaking policies, publications, and publicity practices of some of the country's largest corporations. The survey on which it is based shows that there is little uniformity in public speaking practices and that not enough is usually done to coordinate public speaking and the publicity and public relations activities that relate to it. ""For more than 45 years, research institutions have supported the ″publication charge plan″ and thereby shared part of the expense of publishing the results of the physics research they have sponsored. The cost of publishing falls naturally into two general categories: (1) editorial work and composition; (2) printing and distribution. An excellent fitting of publication income to publication costs can be made by adjusting the publication charges to cover the cost of editorial work and composition and then adjusting subscription rates to cover the cost of printing and distribution. Such an ideal situation does not exist in practice, but the basic philosophy of this kind of division is approximated at the American Institute of Physics for member subscriptions. Specific identification of cost categories and an awareness of their magnitude has also provided incentive to improve productivity and lower costs. Despite inflation, most publication charges are at nearly the same level as they were in 1970. In addition, publication schedules have been streamlined with monthly journals being put in the mail 35 working days after receipt of the last manuscript from the scientific editors. The overall result is a healthy publishing program with journals having a much larger circulation, at lower subscription rates, than journals published without a publication charge plan.""Eighty-seven editors of professional journals in engineering and allied scientific fields answered a questionnaire about their journals and the evaluation and publication of material received. The survey reported was undertaken to develop information about publication in a limited number of journals in high technological areas published by professional societies. It is found that the most common reasons for rejection of material are the subject (not suitable), coverage (questionable significance, too shallow, or questionable validity), and presentation (bad organization or ineffective expression). The most puzzling factors in working with authors relate to suggested changes and to the quality of expression. The most common mistakes are in organization and presentation of material and failure to follow instructions provided. The most common advice is to follow guidelines for manuscripts, write clearly and concisely, and present only material of interest to the reader in a logical sequence with citation of related work.""A reader's most positive acceptance of a journal is usually expressed by his subscription renewal. Some readers are denied this opportunity to express their feelings about a journal if they receive it gratis as part of a membership in a society or organization. A variety of techniques are used by editors and publishers to determine what the reader wants. The American Institute of Physics (AIP) has formed the AIP Publications Survey Panel. The paper examines the publication survey panel, the willingness of society members to participate, and the kinds of information wanted and received.""Information about a discovery by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was widely disseminated - both geographically and demographically - to people who could profit by it. This distribution was achieved by use of audience analysis: The story was written for different audiences in different levels of language and then mailed directly to those audiences, through newspapers, magazines, or by direct mail to the business address of the individual. This communication plan produced valid results in increased readership by recognizing the worth of the message, identifying the audiences who could profit by it, and preparing the message in different formats for these different audiences.""Pressure on scientists to publish is having undesirable effects on the scientists themselves, their work, and their journals. Changing the nature of scientific journals might alleviate some of these effects.""The current journal publication system has four immediate participants: researcher-writers, publishers, libraries, and readers. In response to technological developments which facilitate copying, publishers have increased their demands for additional revenue from libraries. The logic of the publishers' arguments threatens the very existence of institutions which purchase items with the intention of providing them to more than one reader. Society at large does have some interest in the spread of scientific principles and technological information, and the current thrust of the puslishers broadens the concept of the ownership of ideas. In addition, increased restriction on the flow of scientific and technical information may have a significant impact on the advance of science and technology itself.

Based on their experience developing Marketing the Technical Idea or Product Successfully! , the authors describe the principal steps in preparing an anthology. Many of the steps are analogous to those in all writing efforts (defining the scope and audience, making an outline, doing the research); others are unique to the preparation of an anthology (reviewing articles for inclusion, obtaining reprints and copyright permissions). Besides preparing a prospective anthologist with a framework, this article benefits other writers by reviewing several requirements common to the successful completion of any writing project.""Based on feedback from graduate students, from science and engineering faculty who teach graduate students, and from surveys about the skills graduate students need, the authors have designed and taught a graduate-level course in academic publishing. This article describes the need for the course and the theory behind its design, outlines the course content, and presents assessment data from the first three course iterations. The findings indicate that this course has increased students' awareness of the role of rhetorical and discourse knowledge as well as their level of confidence in their ability to write and publish professional work. Further, findings from interviews with faculty advisors yield insight into the benefits of the course for students, advisors, disciplinary programs, and cross-curricular initiatives. © 2007 IEEE.""The implications of a new government administration, technology, and social attitudes are viewed in terms of their effects on the publishers of scientific material. It is expected that there will be less government regulation, greater response to social and occupational needs and trends, increased use of information networks, and further specialization of small technical journals."This article suggests how technical communicators can achieve professional recognition and offers a forecast of the future for members of the profession."For years academicians have utilized communications models in the classroom envioronment as an acceptable vehicle for explaining the communication process. However, industry continues to report the necessity for improved communication skills from college and univer sity graduates. Bridging the gap between theory (through communica tion models) and practice (their application) is an extremely formidable and challenging task for educators. The purpose of this paper is to help university professors of communication to better bridge this gap. © 1979, Sage Publications.

Yet few scholars have attempted to put their theories to a test. The study reported in this paper attempts to do by using a conversation analysis tool called ethnomethodology. In an experimental setting, subjects were videotaped reading and responding to a set of instructions. Their responses indicate that 1) readers will often choose to play a role different from the one embedded in a text, especially if the text role offends them in some way, 2) readers with similar education and interest may display different reader roles, making these roles difficult to predict, and 3) within a single reading, a reader may change roles frequently. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the findings and the appropriateness of ethnomethodology for reader-role research. © 1995 IEEE.""Quad charts are a genre frequently used in scientific and technical environments, yet little prior work has evaluated their potential for reinforcing technical communication fundamentals. This article provides background information about quad charts and notes the benefits of implementing quad charts in the classroom. In particular, introducing engineering students to this genre appeals to their tendency to outline information and incorporate visuals in the planning stages of the composing process. The authors share their approach for integrating quad charts within a collaborative project in a fluid dynamics course and note the ways in which the genre facilitated effective project planning and communication within student teams. © The Author(s) 2015.""Based on a survey of English departments, this article, after predicting a con tinuing strong demand for teachers of business and technical writing in English departments, presents and analyzes the qualifications those depart ments prefer when hiring new faculty to teach business and technical writing. The response indicates that the most attractive candidates for these positions will be those who have completed degree programs that combine the study of literature and composition. These preferences suggest that some English de partments should consider making their degree programs more flexible and demanding. © 1987, Sage Publications.

They advance qualitative research as an alternative to (not a replacement for) quantitative research techniques in communication, define qualitative research and researchers, and propose a model of the interaction between the two types of research. © 1984, Sage Publications.

Using concepts from qualitative health research, this article provides a primer on qualitative methods as an initial effort to fill this gap in the technical communication literature. Specifically, the authors attempt to clarify some of the current confusion over qualitative sampling terminology, explain what qualitative sampling methods are and why they need to be implemented, and offer examples of how to apply commonly used qualitative sampling methods. © 2008 Sage Publications.""This paper summarizes the quality-control methods that the author has used or seen used at five IBM locations that publish various documents. The methods are editing, lead-writer review, peer review, self-review, technical-owner review, reviews by people with special skills, testing, walkthroughs, design review, checklists, mechanical reviews, and user feedback. The author gives his opinions about the advantages and limitations of each method.""When the professional who teaches technical communication uses quality control techniques that are common in industry, technical reports and presentations show continual improvement. These techniques emphasize participative management, which in the classroom means student involvement in improving the process of writing a technical paper or making a technical presentation. Another effective technique derived from industrial management is applying quality control at checkpoints during the process instead of relying on control points at its end. Thus, students become accustomed to process-oriented as well as results-oriented communication. A third improvement technique used by successful Japanese managers encourages and rewards suggestions to an extent unmatched even by the best U.S. programs. In the technical communication classroom, suggestions for quality improvement can be rewarded with extra credit. All these techniques help create a strong classroom culture that leads to student success in improving the quality of their work. © 1989 IEEE""The rapid growth in the number of conferences and papers appearing in conference proceedings publications has increased the need to examine the issue of conference paper quality. Since conference content is included in permanent repositories, such as IEEE's Xplore, the existence of low-quality papers in a conference will degrade the value and reputation of the conference and the repository. The aim of this contribution is to consider these issues from the point of view of the Conference Publications Operations Committee of the IEEE Computer Society, and offer ideas that could lead to improved conference publishing quality for all IEEE societies and even non-IEEE entities. © 2009 IEEE.""Measuring the quality of product reviews via helpfulness votes is problematic for several reasons. I delineate the components of product review quality in order to assist technical communicators who manage their organizations’ usergenerated content in identifying quality content and in helping reviewers produce quality content. Method/Corpus: I analyze results from secondary research on product reviews and discuss six important components of review quality. I focus most attention on five components of review quality that technical communicators can assess— informativeness, valance, credibility, conformity, and readability—and briefly describe a sixth component—user characteristics. I also exemplify these components, drawing from a corpus of 8,973 product reviews gathered in 2013 from a variety of retail and review websites. Results: Based on this analysis, I recommend strategies that technical communicators can use (1) to identify these components of review quality, (2) to develop a rich data set from which they can glean consumer wants and needs as well as trends related to their organizations’ products, and (3) to help reviewers write better reviews. Conclusions: As the amount of user-generated content grows, the need to learn from it and the need to improve it grow. By using their knowledge and skills in new ways, technical communicators who manage and develop product reviews can stay relevant and necessary as organizations rely more and more heavily on user-generated content.""Referees often disagree as to whether to accept or reject a manuscript for publication. Recent investigations have often focused on the study of standard rating forms that ask for appraisal of specified attributes of a manuscript. Scott asked reviewers to rate, on seven criteria, manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. There was some agreement on most of the criteria; correlations were often significant but never large. Importance of the problem and adequacy of design and analysis seemed to affect evaluation most strongly. Whether the use of such a rating form will lead to greater reliability of referees' recommendations is an open question. There are many reasons why referees disagree, of course, and research in this area should be broadly based. The decision-making process of the editor is also very complex and should be the focus of empirical investigation.""Quantitative content analysis can enrich research in technical communication by identifying the frequency of thematic or rhetorical patterns and then exploring their relationship through inferential statistics. Over the last decade, the field has published few content analyses, and several of these applications have been qualitative, diluting the method's inherent rigor. This paper describes the versatility of quantitative content analysis and offers a broader application for its use in the field. This discussion frames two original case studies that illustrate the design variability that content analysis offers researchers. © 2010 IEEE.""We present a user-centered database query language called QBT (Query By Templates) for user communication with databases containing complex structured data, such as data stored in the Extensible Markup Language (XML). XML has revolutionized data storage as well as representation and transfer methods in today's internet applications. The growing popularity of XML as a language for the representation of data has enabled its use for several applications involving storage, interchange, and retrieval of data. Several textual query languages have been proposed for XML retrieval, including the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) recommendation of XQuery. Native XML database systems have been implemented, all of which provide methods for user communication with the database, although most communication methods use text-based query languages or form-based interfaces. QBT, the language presented here, is one of the first attempts toward a generalized alternative language that is based on human factors of familiarity. It is ideal for documents with a simple yet highly recognizable layout (e.g., poems, dictionaries, journals, etc.). We present the QBT language and report results from an initial usability test that shows promise for this type of an interface as a generalized user-database communication method. © 2006 IEEE.""A description is given of software currently available for analyzing and editing the style of word-processed documents, usually those written by nonprofessional communicators.

This article examines research that assesses the accuracy of mass media science reporting. The author also gleans from the research ways in which engineers and scientists can improve the chance of getting their information accurately into the media through interviews with journalists."By emphasizing the negative meanings of words, ignoring variations in translations, and quoting out of context, Steven B. Katz has argued in an influential article that an ""ethic of expediency . . . underlies technical communication and deliberative rhetoric, and by extension writing pedagogy and practice based on it."" Katz's assertion misrepresents the motive of technical communication and its pedagogy, and it brings discredit to the professions of technical communication and the teaching of technical communication. His attempt to discredit the motive of technical communication is part of a two-millennia-long contest for status between intellectuals and the working classes, and it creates unnecessary mistrust at a time in history when people must focus even more on cooperating socially in order to sustain democratic cultures and our physical environment for future generations.""Design: QuikScan is an innovative format that makes print and online documents more usable. QuikScan employs within-document summaries formatted as numbered list items. These numbers correspond to numbers placed in the body of the document where the summarized ideas are discussed in full. QuikScan enables readers to (1) read summaries instead of the detailed content, (2) use the summaries as previews, (3) navigate quickly to the place where a summarized idea is fully discussed in the body of the document, and (4) direct other individuals to locations in the document. QuikScan is nonproprietary; anyone is free to use it and adapt it to their needs. Requirements: QuikScanning requires the skills of a talented editor and takes practice to master. QuikScanners must choose among four kinds of summaries and three numbering systems, depending on the document's heading structure and other factors. Document elements such as graphics require special techniques. The list items that make up QuikScan summaries must be skillfully written, and target numbers must be placed with care. Results: Empirical studies have demonstrated that QuikScan improves comprehension and the ability to navigate quickly through a document. In addition, QuikScan is regarded positively by readers. A pilot study suggests the value of QuikScan for blind readers. Drawbacks and limitations: QuikScan requires extra work, makes documents longer, and increases both visual complexity and the number of short pages. It is not suitable for documents that do not much benefit from summarization or for documents with free-form layouts.""The use of quirk topics can help solve one of the technical writing instructor's hardest problems: selection of a challenging topic. A quirk topic derives from some paradox of science or technology which, upon reflection, calls for thought. The quirk topic challenges the technical writing student to focus on the reader, gather data, and interpret and report data convincingly. This article explains the use of quirk topics, suggests twenty such topics, and explains how to solve problems of their use.""This case recounts my experiences during a four-year participatory design project with colleagues in Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I attempted to develop a system for people working in rural areas to share business information via mobile phones.Research questions: For the first phase of this project: How do businesspeople in Katanga Province use their cell phones to support their business operations? How do they want to use these phones in their businesses? How do their use and attitudes compare with those of graduate students at a Midwestern US university? For the second phase of this project: Can a cell-phone delivered information system be designed for artisanal miners and small farmers in Katanga Province to share local pricing information for copper, cobalt, and maize?Situating the case: Researchers in participatory design for social and/or technological change have traditionally assumed that including users in early design phases will result in democratization of project outcomes. When these participatory design projects are situated in intercultural settings, however, they are complicated by political and economic conditions, as well as differences in values and social relations. Because participatory design relies on dialogue within robust, multimodal communication networks, weaknesses in this approach arise when trusted social relations are not in place upon which to build these multimodal communication networks. Cases of participatory design between colleagues in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa illustrate profound effects of political and economic inequities on participatory design projects.Methodology: This is an experience report of a project that developed initially from a classroom project in which my students in the US conducted a communication audit for a partner based in Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A US-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) arranged the partnership and I later went to the field to carry out this project.About the case: Working with an NGO while based exclusively in the US, we attempted to develop a system from which people working in rural areas could share business information, such as reporting business conditions in a rural location back to the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters 75 km away, via mobile phones. The project did not work because people in Katanga were not familiar with the information design issues involved in the system and I was not familiar with the actual business situation at the NGO in Katanga. To address these issues, I traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo and interviewed NGO staff and clients. But my presence in the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters created irreparable social disruption. I continued the project with a new client in Katanga and revised goals for the information-sharing system, but that system, too, did not work for lack of a trusted social network of informants to participate in the information-sharing system. In the end, I was only able to complete an initial analysis of the needs.Conclusions: Despite the need to abandon the project, this case raised these questions about participatory design for information and communication technologies (ICT) projects when collaborators do not 'speak the same language:' How can communication researchers effectively build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations in order to facilitate successful participatory design projects? Given the research obligations and reward structures at US universities, is it feasible for communication researchers to spend the time to build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations, which may not yield publishable research or quantifiable results for three years or more? Given the political and social conditions in many developing areas, can communication researchers rely on the stable conditions and personal relations that are necessary to conduct participatory design for ICT projects? © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article engages disciplinary (and interdisciplinary) conversations at the intersections of race, rhetoric, technology, and technical communication and offers a case study of curriculum development that supports disciplinary inquiry at these complex interstices. Specifically, informed by a decolonial framework, this article discusses the status of cultural and critical race studies in technical communication scholarship; tentative definitions of race, rhetoric, and technology; the cultural usability research conducted and located accountability in the process of designing a graduate course that studies rhetorics of race and technology; and the implications of this inquiry for the discipline, field, and practices of technical communication. © The Author(s) 2012.""Technical writers and editors - as well as people who supervise or review the work of writers and editors - sometimes need to ″debug″ a piece of writing quickly. The method the author recommends consists of nine reviews - all made in one or two passes: 1. checking compliance with requirements to make sure the report or proposal hits the target; 2. ″dry-running″ complex procedures to make sure they will work; 3. cutting out or resolving incongruities; 4. verifying computations; 5. checking for suspicious data sources; 6. preventing omission of vital ideas; 7. verifying inclusion of promised materials; 8. playing critics' roles; 9. checking the adequacy of conclusions and recommendations. Note three precautions: First, these reviews focus mainly on the content of the proposal or report. The checks will not make the document more readable. Second, quick debugging will not turn bad plans into good plans. For instance, the checks may not always produce a proposal that sells a bidder's product or service. Third, a cursory debugging should never replace careful editing when time allows (or the importance of the writing demands) such editing. The nine methods are discussed in detail, and an example of their application is given.""Describes the usefulness of applying the principles of business process re-engineering to online documentation  Presents the benefits of user-centered design, iterative user and task feedback, and an interdisciplinary design team.""The above mentioned paper (W.A. Kennedy, ibid., vol.PC-31, no.3, p.130-4, Sept. 1988) put forth a case for using speaking assignments in the technical classroom as a means of addressing deficiencies in the oral communication skills of graduates of technical programs. In an introduction to this initial article, readers were asked to submit their critical comments and observations in order to provide the basis for a followup dialogue. The author summarizes and discusses the ensuing comments. He explores areas of general agreement with the suggestions contained in the initial article and areas of concern, and he offers some general conclusions and recommendations.""The author explores why computer users often do not use the HELP function offered by many programs. Three explanations are frequenctly offered for not using HELP: Asking for help: may break the user's flow of thought; disorients the user as far as navigation from screen to screen is concerned; and often does not provide the answer the user needs. Experience suggests that people have a low tolerance for unhelpful help, and that their initial expectations are quickly revised downward. What people think they want, what people expect, and implications of why users want context-dependent help are discussed. A conversational model for help is suggested. The application of a social, conversational model to human-computer interaction accounts for several phenomena that have been observed: people react badly to poor response time; people also react badly to very quick response time; and people react emotionally to programs.""This paper reports an empirical study in which 22 managers were interviewed regarding how they prefer to learn about popular management ideas. The managers indicated a clear preference for obtaining such information through seminar attendance rather than the reading of books. Through an analysis of the interview transcripts informed by socio-semiotic theory, the authors identify the semiotic code shaping this preference, chart its regularities and inconsistencies, and uncover several ironies in how this code is used and understood. These ironies reflect and give rise to contradictory responses on the part of managers which enable them to negotiate the conflicting demands placed upon them by the various competing value systems which govern and complicate their working and private lives. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""The work of a technical writer must be readable and easy to understand. Indeed, there are methods to teach students how to be readable. But is it reasonable to request creativity in their work? There are differences between the style of a technical writer and of a novelist. But there are also similarities. To be creative in his technical writing, the technical writer must be influenced by the novelist.

Most formulas are based on two parameters: word length and sentence length. They can provide an index of difficulty but they do not necessarily indicate what is wrong with a too difficult passage, nor do they show how to clear up foggy writing. This Forum is comprised of six essays, both pro and con, on the use of readability formulas. They provide background on the more common formulas and explore their general limitations.

Some evidence and reasons for this indifference are presented. Three current methods of measuring readability are dscribed. Two readability formulas involving word load and sentence load are the Dale-Chall, which uses a word-list, and the Fry, whch uses a graph. The cloze procedure is a nonformula technique which involves the reader as well as the material being evaluated. The application of these methods is illustrated with passages of technical writing of varying difficulty.""While readability formulas are intended to help writers and teachers of business communications, the formulas have in fact been counter-productive in several ways. The formulas don’t really help writers to predict the reada bility of their prose because they oversimplify, because they have not been calibrated for adult readers, and because reading is so highly individual. In addition, the formulas don’t help writers to produce readable documents either; though short sentences and words correlate with difficulty, they do not cause difficulty. Finally, the formulas hamper the teaching of business writing because they emphasize written products instead of the process of writing and because they discourage teachers from employing practical techniques that can develop students’ abilities to manipulate stylistic options. © 1981, Sage Publications.

The subjects received either a Code reading or a Commentary reading. The subjects answered fifteen questions about the reading and rated the complexity of the reading onfive dimensions. The subjects assigned to the Code reading had significantlyfewer correct responses and took significantly longer to answer the experimental questions than subjects assigned to the Commentary reading. Also, the Code reading was perceived by the subjects to be significantly more complex than the Commentary reading. These experimental results are in contrast to the Flesch Readability Formula and Gunning Fog Index readability level of the two passages, which showed the two presentation styles (code/legal and commentary/prose) to be of approximate equal difficulty. © 1983, Sage Publications.

An awareness by authors and editors of the techniques available through readability research studies leads to significant savings in time and effort, as well as increased benefits in comprehension and learning of the reader. Examples of use in technical publications show how exchanges between author and reader can be more effective and productive. The techniques have wide application also to publications of all kinds, and provide a valuable resource to achieve optimum results in communication or information products. The discussion is based on the knowledge and experience gained by the writer through academic and practical applications in editing and preparing a wide variety of general and technical communications.""Past research indicates that readability levels of annual reports are “restrictive.” But are they “restrictive” to their most important audience-the stockholder?

To answer this question, an analysis was made of the problems detected in four public information brochures. The average amount of feedback per participant did not vary among the four brochures, but the severity of the problems did. Male participants mentioned more problems than female participants, but the problems detected by female participants were on average more severe. Highly educated participants detected more problems than participants with a lower level of education. No differences in problem types mentioned were found between male and female participants, and only one difference was found between the two educational levels: Highly educated participants focused more strongly on the structuring of information. In general, brochure characteristics had more effect on the types of feedback collected than the two demographic participant characteristics.""A new orientation toward intercultural and international communication will demand a redefinition of the professional communicator and professional communication: Translation - understood in a broad sense - will become a crucial skill.

Specifically, the study examines reading ease between the English and Chinese versions of 65 corporate annual reports in Hong Kong and the English and Malay versions of 53 annual reports in Malaysia. The same passages from the Chairman's Address in both languages were scored using Flesch and Yang formulas for Hong Kong and Flesch and Yunus formulas for Malaysia. Results provide some tentative impression that the indigenous language version is easier to read than the English-written counterparts. In addition, evidence suggested that the English passages in Malaysian annual reports are easier to read than the English passages in Hong Kong annual reports. Taken overall, the results suggest that different language versions could produce different reading behaviour and may have resource allocation decision-making implications. © 2002 by the Association for Business Communication.""Classroom reading primarily involves reading to learn or reading that centers on topics, whereas workplace reading primarily involves reading to do or reading that specifies actions.

Scholarly publications and public discourse have suggested reasons for language choice, but these were not based on the perspectives of practitioners. Research questions: (1) What reasons do Dutch job ad writers give for using all-English, all-Dutch, or partly English ads and what genre factors inform these reasons? (2) To what extent do the reasons given by Dutch job ad makers for using all-English, all-Dutch, or partly English ads complement reasons mentioned in publications on job ads? Literature review: Genre theory identifies three factors as important determinants of genre: contextual factors (such as characteristics of the organization and the sector in which the genre is produced), reader-writer factors (characteristics of the genre's target audience and author), and textual factors (the genre's content, structure, and wording). The reasons mentioned for the use of all-English job ads are that English is the organization's corporate language and that the organization is looking for English-speaking candidates. The reasons given for the use of job ads in the local language are that English is less clear than the local language and that English words are strange and exaggerated compared to equivalents in the local language. Among the reasons mentioned for the use of partly English job ads are that English words attract more attention than equivalents in the local language and that English job titles sound more modern and have more status than equivalent job titles in the local language. Methodology: In this qualitative study, we conducted 25 interviews with practitioners who designed job ads in the Netherlands, selected because they had recently placed an all-English, an all-Dutch, or a partly English job ad in a Dutch newspaper. They were asked an open-ended question about their reasons behind the language used in the job ad they placed. Interview data were labelled and categorized; subsequently, patterns were identified across categories. Results and conclusions: The interviews showed that all three types of genre factors - contextual, reader-writer, and textual - underlie practitioners' language choices. Practitioners mentioned the same types of factors that were mentioned in publications on job ads, but gave a greater variety of reasons for language choice. Of the reasons mentioned by the practitioners, the large majority were not given in publications. These findings underline the importance of obtaining text producers' perspectives and can be used to sensitize both novice and experienced professional Human Resources writers to the relevance of genre factors in language choice. A limitation of the present study is that the desired effects of language choice mentioned by the respondents were not verified with the target group of the job ads. Therefore, future research on language choice in workplace writing should test whether particular language choices in job ads actually achieve the recruitment effects Human Resource Manager professionals expect. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This study provides insight into practitioners' reasons for choosing a particular language (English versus the local language) in the genre of job ads in countries where English is a foreign language (EFL countries). Scholarly publications and public discourse have suggested reasons for language choice, but these were not based on the perspectives of practitioners. Research questions: (1) What reasons do Dutch job ad writers give for using all-English, all-Dutch, or partly English ads and what genre factors inform these reasons? (2) To what extent do the reasons given by Dutch job ad makers for using all-English, all-Dutch, or partly English ads complement reasons mentioned in publications on job ads? Literature review: Genre theory identifies three factors as important determinants of genre: contextual factors (such as characteristics of the organization and the sector in which the genre is produced), reader-writer factors (characteristics of the genre's target audience and author), and textual factors (the genre's content, structure, and wording). The reasons mentioned for the use of all-English job ads are that English is the organization's corporate language and that the organization is looking for English-speaking candidates. The reasons given for the use of job ads in the local language are that English is less clear than the local language and that English words are strange and exaggerated compared to equivalents in the local language. Among the reasons mentioned for the use of partly English job ads are that English words attract more attention than equivalents in the local language and that English job titles sound more modern and have more status than equivalent job titles in the local language. Methodology: In this qualitative study, we conducted 25 interviews with practitioners who designed job ads in the Netherlands, selected because they had recently placed an all-English, an all-Dutch, or a partly English job ad in a Dutch newspaper.

Central to this framework is attention to the linking of tools, texts, and people distributed across space-time. This process foregrounds the complex mediation of activity and the dynamic pathways shaping the ways English is being reassembled in local-global ecologies. © Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Basic editorial questions regarding the rebirth of a journal and the questions of editorial and financial responsibility of the publisher are discussed. Three examples of reborn journals are given: one each in the fields of botany, medical biology, and zoology. The problem of changing the editorial image of a journal and the problem of new, competing journals in a particular field are also discussed."The author hypothesized that flashing target prepositions and verb inflections would result in greater recall of passages presented on a video screen. Thirty-four prelingually deaf freshmen were shown two passages on a video screen in a crossed-cell experiment. Eighteen students saw target prepositions and verb inflections flashed in capitals in a lesson on Newton but not in a lesson on Roemer. Sixteen students saw target prepositions and verb inflections flashed in capitals in the lesson on Roemer but not in the lesson on Newton. No statistically significant difference was shown between the groups of students nor between the two lessons. Students obtained scores of 97% on the targets when they were flashed in capitals and only 83% when not flashed (p less than 0. 0005)."The author reports on a survey of 323 Nashxille, Tennessee residents which was designed to ascertain how the public views and reacts to direct mail advertising in the mid-1970's. It was found that people are not particularly fond of advertising mail but they do tend to defend, within limits, mail advertisers'right to use the U. S. Postal Service. The research also revealed ways in which mail advertising can be made more productive. © 1975, Sage Publications.

The assumption seems to be that source success depends upon source credibility, selection of the right channel, and use of certain cognitive approaches. However, receiver motivational factors predispose the receiver to respond in a particular manner to a particular message. Message content and treatment must be fashioned so as to identify with receiver motivational predispositions within the particular communication event.""Recent advances in printing technology have reduced the cost of typeset-quality printers, but the production of attractively formatted documents requires typographic skill and special training on computer-based text processing systems. The goals of current research are to make text processing systems ″user friendly″ and to support the production of typeset-quality documents. Four software systems that aid the process of producing formatted documents are discussed: Scribe, developed at Carnegie-Mellon University; Bravo, an experimental system developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center; TEX and METAFONT, from Stanford University; and Etude, currently under development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.""Because the intricacy of language suggests that it both creates and reflects women's roles in society, reciprocal accommodation may be the best way for women to achieve influential positions in management. Reciprocal accommodation is a collaborative process whereby women practice empowering communication strategies while those already in positions of authority actively acknowledge women's right to those strategies and the power they represent. © 1991, Sage Publications.

However, posthuman contexts, such as virtual reality, challenge traditional methods for audience analysis and invention. In virtual environments, knowledge is constructed by and through embodied interactions with people, technologies, spaces, and ideas-and the dual processes of analysis and invention are conflated. In this article, I present data from a semester-long comparative study between two technical communication courses. Students in both courses created instructions for filming in a virtual environment, but students from only one of these courses experienced the space/place of virtual reality. The data emphasize the importance of embodied experiences in technical communication pedagogy and practice. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""To complement past emphasis on understanding other cultures, the field of intercultural business communication needs a stronger focus on understanding oneself. Cultural identity is an individual's sense of self derived from formal or informal membership in groups that transmit and inculcate knowledge, beliefs, values, attitudes, traditions, and ways of life. A broad conception of cultural identity should not privilege nationality but instead should balance components related to vocation, class, geography, philosophy, language, and the social aspects of biology. Cultural identity changes over time and evokes emotions. It is intertwined with power and privilege, affected by close relationships, and negotiated through communication. The proposed model of cultural identity highlights components directly related to business, such as economic class and professional affiliation, and demonstrates how culture not only connects people but also defines them as unique individuals. This model can expand research and enrich teaching in intercultural business communication. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""This research provides a framework identifying dynamic tensions that occur as subordinates try to maintain a sufficient degree of politeness while reporting to superiors on workplace tasks. Building on politeness theory, the framework suggests how conventional politeness dimensions, such as deference, solidarity, and non-imposition are challenged by organizational obligations and workplace tasks requiring confidence, direction, and individuality. The framework evolved from a series of analyses of two samples: one consisting of e-mail between international project teams and their domestically located supervisors, the other of Asian and U.S. business undergraduates' responses to two workplace scenarios involving critiquing a superior's work. Analyses revealed competing communicative dimensions relevant to subordinate-to-superior interactions, including dimensions that are underdeveloped in politeness literature. Examples from these data suggest that managing a sufficient equilibrium between these dimensions requires a substantial knowledge of rhetorical and linguistic alternatives.""This article considers how issues of power and legitimacy in technical communication are connected to clearly defining what a technical communicator does. An articulation of what technical communicators do can grant the field power in presenting a united front to employers with respect to the value technical communicators bring to the workplace. So as to leverage the power and legitimacy associated with articulating what technical communicators do, this article reviews and revises the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH)'s definition of technical communicator. To effectively revise the OOH's definition, this article reviews academic and practitioner scholarship in technical communication and the administration of technical and professional writing programs. It demonstrates that concerns about practical skills, conceptual skills, and flexibility are related to legitimacy and power. These concerns can be used as criteria to evaluate and revise the OOH's definition of technical communicator. In closing, the article discusses the benefits associated with the revised definition and how these benefits are related to issues of power and legitimacy in the field. © The Author(s) 2016.""Challenges some putative rules of grammar and mechanics in an effort to improve technical texts for the people who read them* Proposes that editing decisions be based on prescriptive grammar, ""organic"" grammar, and relevant research""What roles does writing play in larger communications also involving physically discrete but related texts of other media? How may the properties of what we normally consider writing be modified in such communications? The intermedial context of much workplace writing has been largely overlooked. This study of an insurance company’s communication department describes how (a) three written products served as parts of larger messages in multiple media campaigns, (b) an attempt to combine composing processes for print and video failed, and (c) conflicting generic and stylistic properties of other media caused an intermedial graft to fail. The author’s study shows that in the right circumstances, a multiple media “overtext” can override some of the rules that govern what and how one communicates in an individual medium. When a written text is involved, its nature may change as it forms symbiotic relationships with texts of other media. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Writing reuse is predominantly studied through the literature on single sourcing and enacted via technologies built on single-sourcing models. Such theoretical models and derivative technologies cast reusable content as context-less and rhetorically neutral, a perspective that overlooks the underlying rhetorical strategies of reuse. The author argues for a new understanding of reuse as a rhetorical act of creating hybrid utterances that gather their rhetorical strength by assembling ever larger and denser actor networks. © 2010 SAGE Publications.""The genre of technical description is seeing a resurgence, particularly in online locations, where new, hybrid versions have emerged. The technical explanation, one such hybrid, proliferates on the social message board site Reddit and the message board “Explain Like I’m Five,” in which answers to complex questions are crowdsourced. This study examines 233 such questions and their answers, identifying the effort needed to generate technical explanations as distributed and coordinative technical communication work. © 2017 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Roman Jakobson's six-factored model of verbal communication provides the schema to generate formal definitions of business writing and technical writing. It also enables us to apply these definitions to communication in the world of work. The six factors - addresser, addressee, context, message, contact, and code - have six parallel functions - emotive, conative, referential, poetic, phatic, and metalingual. Each of these factor/function pairs is present to some degree in all types of writing, from technical writing to poetry. However, in certain types of written communication a few functions dominate the others. For instance, the referential or informational function is primary in technical and scientific writing. An examination of different binary functional relationships yields distinctions among various types of writing. For example, the inspection of the you versus it relationship yields the most substantive theoretical distinction between persuasive business writing and technical writing. From this single theoretical distinction emerge various practical aspects of communication, such as good will, the 'you-attitude,' and the techniques of behavior modification applicable in business writing; and objectivity, clarity, and precision of meaning aimed for in technical writing.""This paper argues that virtual communication spaces such as the World Wide Web (WWW) offer unique opportunities for collaboration within technical writing classrooms. Three common types of project scenarios are identified, along with the discourse communities and collaborative relationships that are supported and emphasized by each project scenario. A technical writing assignment is described that emphasizes the benefits of students collaborating within the WWW, an emerging, real-world discourse community. In describing this assignment, we redefine collaboration to include activities used by WWW site developers and designers. © 1996 IEEE.""Professional identity is oft explored in the field, but such identities usually reside institutionally and may exclude women who engage in professional communication from the workplace of the home. One instantiation of this extra-institutional professionalism is mom blogs, the authors of which create content, find sponsors, and address issues important to mothers. Yet the women lack legitimacy as professionals because of the title ""mommy blogger"" and because of the notion that blogging is a hobby. My qualitative study explores how mom bloggers claim a professional space in communication. I interviewed 22 mom bloggers, using Faber's (2002, [18]) theory of professionalism and Durack's (1997, [17]) ideas of redefining terms, such as ""workplace,"" to include women. My findings show that mom bloggers engage in the characteristics of professional communicators, model egalitarian professionalism, employ an ethic of care that combats elitism, and challenge the field to include their work, from the home and through new media, as professional.? ©?2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article examines how writers used the World Wide Web to create and change documents, and how changing documentation challenged the production models and processes at a supercomputing company.""Designing a form for use by the general public requires application of many basic principles of technical communication, beginning with analysis of purpose, context, and audience.

If the editor sees that the author has not selected and arranged the ideas to accord with the audience and purpose of the report, he or she must reselect the necessary and sufficient ideas and rearrange them. Rhetorical editing thus calls on the editor to edit at the scale of the entire report - not just at the scale of individual words and sentences. Although seemingly a bold departure from conventional editing, rhetorical editing merely applies the principles of rhetoric widely used in technical writing and composition.""A primary goal of both distance and traditional courses should be that of distance reduction - a shrinking of the mental and time-dimensional separation between the students, the instructor, and the content to be learned. This sort of reduction brings the learning events of a class together in a holistic way that maintains an ongoing dialog with participants. This paper reports the results of a study that evaluated the use and effectiveness of course websites in three undergraduate technical communication courses. Research questions investigated students' site-visit frequency, purpose of use, and perceptions of distance reduction during out-of-class times via the constant availability of course companion sites. A survey was conducted to measure student responses to the course website used in their technical communication course. Anecdotal and empirical data indicate that course companion sites do decrease students' perceived distance during out-of-class times; however, they also produce unanticipated results, such as increased student dependency on online information and a low tolerance for out-of-date information. Future research is suggested to further investigate the impact of course websites on both cognitive and affective modes of student participation and learning. © 2004 IEEE.""The office of the future is conceived of as an increasingly automated office. To produce significant improvements when office procedures become automated, adjustments will have to be made in the way current office operations are performed. One of the important office operations is data entry. This paper describes current problems with data entry forms and discusses a method, called the syntax method, through which some of the problems can be eliminated. In particular, the technique used in this method for identifying duplicate names and improving the names of the elements is described. Results from a test of the method on three Department of Defense Contractor Cost Performance Forms are provided.""This bibliographic essay presents two divergent approaches to information theory—one quantitative and one qualitative—that provide fundamentally different orientations to the concept of redundancy. The bridge between these two orientations is the linking of information and probability theory to semantics. The mathematical and behavioral approaches provide the basisfor the systematic classification of redundancy: information theoretic redundancy, true redundancy, internal and input memory redundancy, and between-channel redundancy. Cost-benefit considerations of redundancy in business communication focus on the variables of time; space; and noise, the ultimate limiter of effective communication The authors report that, because noise exists in all communication channels and because humans have limited capacities as information-processing systems, the goal of eliminating redundancy is not a practical one. Three research implications for redundancy are (1) national and international business communication, with special emphasis on dual- or multi-channel corporate teleconferencing; (2) error-detecting and correcting systems in artificial languages designed for man-machine communication; and (3) assessing communication efficiency in terms of different degrees of corporate culture development. © 1984, Sage Publications.

We develop hypotheses based on the proposition that synchronous communication media are perceived to be more effective for convergence communication while asynchronous communication media are perceived to be more suitable for conveyance communication. These hypotheses were tested using data collected from 81 IM users in four organizations by means of survey instruments developed for this study. The results suggest that although IM was perceived to be a highly synchronous communication medium, it was not perceived to be as effective for convergence communication as it was for conveyance communication. These results seem to challenge the general propositions of media capacity theories. Theoretical implications are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.""The application of computer tools to mediating and promoting collaborative design efforts between mutually distant parties has become feasible.

We wanted to give practitioners a forum to provide their perspectives on what research is and what questions the field should be researching. Method: We conducted 30 asynchronous interviews with practitioners, and then analyzed the interviews for common themes and topics. Results: Interviewees (practitioners) noted an interest in research that examined how individuals (particularly specific audiences) use different technologies as well as an interest in collaborating with academics to explore research on different topics and from different perspectives. Conclusion: The information reported here and the related questions it raises can enhance understanding of and facilitate collaboration across the field. This study helps industry practitioners of technical communication to better understand how other industry practitioners in the field view and think of research; it also helps academic researchers in technical communication to better understand perspectives, assumptions, and expectations industry practitioners have about research. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Instead it is necessary to explore the ethical nature of the professional fields technical and science writing supports, the ethical positions in closely related fields, and the work that has already been accomplished in the general area of communication ethics. Once such a foundation has been established, one can begin to explore the most basic influences inherent in language uses on ethical concerns.""Extended interviews with recent engineering hires by a major electronics manufacturing firm reveal substantial differences in communication training among engineering programs. Despite differences in educational background and current position, however, these engineers identify the same set of key communication skills that they believe should be developed in undergraduate electrical engineering programs. These skills, which relate to the ability to communicate well in face-to-face and small group settings, to use electronic mail effectively, and to identify audiences and address them appropriately, can be taught without adding courses to the engineering curriculum, provided course content and evaluation of student work emphasize the importance of these skills. © 1995 IEEE.""This study explores the types of feedback and implicated relational systems in an online design critique using an inductive analysis of an online critique about a project focused on designing a new food pyramid. The results reveal eight types of feedback and three implied relational systems, all of which suggest relational archetypes that are disconnected from typical preprofessional activity systems. These results illustrate the potential for the online medium to be a space in which participants pursue idealized relational identities and interactions that are not necessarily authentic approximations of actual relational systems. Using these results as a foundation, the author discusses the potential relevance of the online medium to this setting and the implications of relational authenticity and genre knowledge on oral genre teaching and learning. ©2011 SAGE Publications.""This study examines the relational implications of same-sex workplace romances (WRs) and compares results with findings for heterosexual WRs. Working adults (N = 147; M age = 30.87 years old) read a scenario describing a same-sex WR and completed measures of deception, trust, and credibility. Results indicate that employees trust gay and lesbian peers dating superiors less, are more likely to deceive them, and view them as less credible than gay and lesbian peers dating other peers. Employees also perceive gay coworkers as more caring and of higher character than they perceive lesbian coworkers. Comparisons with prior research indicate that peers report less deception with gay and lesbian coworkers and higher perceptions of gay and lesbian coworkers' caring and character compared with heterosexual coworkers. Sex of the peer affected perceptions of gay and lesbian, but not heterosexual peers. There were no differences in the effect sizes for dating a superior versus a peer between gay and lesbian and heterosexual WRs. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between organizational communication satisfaction and organizational commitment in three Guatemalan organizations. Data were collected using three questionnaires: the Downs's (1990) Communication Audit Questionnaire (CAQ), the Mowday, Porter, and Steers's (1979) Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), and the Cook and Wall's (1980) Organizational Commitment Instrument (OCI). Results indicated that, first, there was an explicit positive relationship between communication satisfaction and employees' organizational commitment. Second, school teachers were significantly more satisfied with the communication practices and more committed to their organization than were the employees of the other two organizations (a hospital and a food factory). Third, supervisors were significantly more satisfied than were subordinates with overall communication practices. Fourth, employees with more tenure were significantly more committed to their organizations. Fifth, the three-factor solution for the Cook and Wall's Organizational Commitment Instrument did not emerge in this sample as theorized by its authors. A two-factor solution for the Mowday, Porter, and Steers's Organizational Commitment Questionnaire emerged as appropriate for the Guatemalan sample. Finally, conflicting findings in the internal reliability and factor analysis of one of the commitment instruments used in this study conducted in Guatemala and in studies conducted in the United States raise several important issues on the use of research instruments in cross-cultural studies. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""We evaluate 45 jobs professional communicators might occupy. Specifically, we examine the impact of creativity on careers that may become more or less easily outsourced domestically or offshore in the future. We are unable to find any particular relationship between creativity, per se, and job security. Instead, we find that people with knowledge of the processes required for innovation are more valued by industry than those recognized as creative. We suggest that to be prepared for the evolution of the global economy, technical communicators and their educators should understand ""innovation"" in its formal context and be able to apply that knowledge in their workplaces and classrooms.""Writing and speaking are basically different activities, and they must be separately developed.

Data were obtained from 116 managers using questionnaires completed anonymously. The investigation found that the managers' vision setter role was positively related to the use of the consultation tactic. Managers' motivator role was positively related to the use of ingratiating and inspirational appeals, and negatively related to the use of exchange and coali tion tactics. Managers'analyzer role was related to the use of pressure and rationality tactics, and negatively related to the use of the coalition tactic. Managers'task master role was positively related to the use of the exchange and inspirational appeals tactics.

Applications of technology in making direct communication are indicated; the re-presentation of direct communications is shown as a set of technological processes (e. g. , storage and play-back, or transmission and reception) with ideological reinforcement, and so is the reproduction of communications thus transformed or reconstituted (e. g. , production of photographic, electronic, typset, or coded copies). Storage and retrieval of reproduced copies are shown together, without methodological detail, as a separate, major aspect of communication, although they are considered to be part of the technological and ideological applications of re-presentation and reproduction."This article reports an experiment to examine the effectiveness of five different responses to a hypothetical proposal request."This study sought to determine the relative importance of business communication skills needed by the newly hired college graduate for the next ten years.

The presentation of information must be adjusted relative to the knowledge and interests of the writer's audience. Problems arise when the relative differences in audiences are slight, but nonetheless important. Albert Einstein's writing can be used as an example of skillful adaptation of material for audiences with subtle differences. A prime example is his special theory of relativity, which he published in three versions for technical, semitechnical, and nontechnical audiences. Students, teachers, and technical writers can learn much from the way Einstein uses tone, personal address, varying levels of diction, definitions, and concrete examples of each of the three expositions of his special theory of relativity.""Colleges of business grapple with a perceived lack of quality in their graduates' professional writing and recognize students' need to learn disciplinary discourses.

Research question: As entrepreneurs learn to pitch ideas to unfamiliar markets, how do they revise their slide decks by reusing content from other professional communication genres? Specifically, what strategies do they follow when reusing content? Literature review: The professional communication literature demonstrates that reuse tends to take place in documentation cycles where documents are set in interaction with each other and that reuse itself involves rhetorical choices. Yet such reuse strategies have not been examined in existing studies of entrepreneurial pitches in marketing and technology commercialization. Methodology: In an exploratory qualitative study, researchers textually analyzed 14 sets of five related document genres in the archives of an entrepreneurship program. These genres represented a full cycle of activity: application to the program, initial pitches, initial feedback from program personnel, detailed feedback from representative stakeholders in the target market, and revised pitches. Interviews and surveys of program personnel further contextualize the data. Results and conclusions: Entrepreneurs reused content from professional communication genres, including those that they had generated as well as those generated by market stakeholders. However, reuse went simply beyond accepting and copying feedback; as they learned to make their pitch arguments, these entrepreneurs had to weigh this feedback and engage with it critically. This reuse can be characterized as Accepting (repeating verbatim or in close paraphrase); Continuing (extending lines of argument); and Resisting (rebutting lines of argument). These findings suggest that entrepreneurs need all three strategies as they refine their pitches for their target markets. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Examines how Korean entrepreneurs in an entrepreneurship program revised their English-language slide decks for their competitive presentations (“pitches”) by reusing content from professional communication genres, including their own documents and feedback from potential stakeholders in their target markets.

Our discussion examines the field of professional writing, focusing not so much on defining it as a discipline as on working out its curricular geography, an activity that will affect its status in both academy and industry. To that end, we explore the status of professional writing within the department of English by (a) briefly examining the problem of defining professional writing; (b) reviewing several theoretical positions within English that have provided a status for professional writing—literature, rhetoric/composition, business and technical writing—to expose the competition for control of the term and to surface the implications of accepting these various groups on their own terms; and (c) considering the curricular status to which professional writing might aspire by sketching a geography that positions professional writing in a new space within English. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Until a generation ago, English teachers and editors admonished students and writers to uphold the traditions of formal style.

Wecan avoid a similar decline by regarding ourselves as teachers, not research scholars; as creators, not analyzers; and as secondary, not primary.""This pilot study investigates challenges experienced by technical communicators who work remotely from their audiences and project teams and identifies factors that contribute to success in these work arrangements. Method: I surveyed and interviewed seven technical communicators who worked remotely as consultants for large U.S. corporate organizations, including two Fortune 500 financial services companies, a professional services firm, and a safety certification organization. No participant performed more than 15% of her work on-site. Each participant had a minimum of three years' experience working remotely and had previous experience working as an on-site technical communicator for other organizations. The surveys and follow-up interviews provided qualitative data, which I then coded and analyzed. Results: Unlike local technical communicators, who may have limited contact with their end-user audience, these remote technical communicators had no direct contact with their end-user audience and instead relied on other in-house and remote team members (such as project managers) to provide audience information. The remote technical communicators reported facing challenges such as lack of social interaction; inability to stop working; and a lack of information and resources. They reported using various skills and strategies to cope with challenges, citing communication, selfdiscipline/motivation, and organization/structure the most frequently. Conclusion: Given the trend of organizations choosing to outsource writing and training jobs and hire consultants to take on these roles, technical communicators should acquaint themselves with the potential challenges of working on a remote team. Study participants reported such challenges as difficulty building trusting, new relationships; missing out on small talk and sometimes even critical conversations; and feeling isolated.""Business communication arose from the practical nature of the ars dictaminis and the merging of process-oriented humanistic epistolography with the medieval formulaic dictamen in writers such as Erasmus. Like the Italian church leaders and businessmen, medieval English gentry soon grasped the value of correspondence. English letter-writing guides and model books, which began to appear in 1568, mirror both Erasmus and the rigid models of the ars dictaminis. The increasingly utilitarian English commercial society of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries ultimately led to the demise of the rhetorical tradition that originally surrounded English letter-writing guides. Today's tendency to use a product (formulaic), rather than process (rhetorical), approach in developing business letters obscures the rich tradition surrounding the rise of epistolary method and reduces the effectiveness of the final product. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Citation of references by number, one-column, ragged-right-margin layout, and third-person writing style are also preferred by a majority of the respondents. The preferences of managers and nonmanagers are very similar for all aspects of technical report format covered by the survey.""The theme of the 1977 Teaching Methodology & Concepts Committe was, “Freewheeling in Business Communication.” Guided by one principle—to contribute to the improvement of instruction in business communication—members of the group were set free to pursue different and interesting areas of concern.

In the review process, significantly more managers than nonmanagers use the summary and conclusion, whereas significantly more nonmanagers use the abstract and title page. The most common sequence of review consists of the title page, abstract, and summary, in that order, for both groups. In the reading process, the conclusion, results and discussion, and summary are the components read by the highest percentage of both groups.""Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are often said to be risky business, especially in cross-border M&As, when an acquiring company faces a possible clash of both corporate and national cultures. This article focuses on the acquisition of the Argentine oil company Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) by the Spanish oil company Repsol in 1999. In particular, using a corpus of Repsol's M&A related press releases, the author demonstrates how the acquiring company draws on forward-looking statements, promotional language, and repetition to discursively display its financial and moral competences to negotiate the acquisition. The analysis will also show how, at a certain moment, Repsol introduces an appeasing antitrust narrative to respond to the hurt (nationalistic) feelings in YPF's Latin American environment. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Communication of consumer needs for scientific and engineering work through Requests for Proposal (REP) often fails because the RFPs describe the equipment, or means, to accomplish a given task rather than the task to be accomplished, or end.

This paper identifies that paradox and stresses that in response to limitations of time, the technical communications teacher must design an introductory course which reflects current research in communications and teaching methodology. The course must serve the engineering student efficiently and effectively. One such design for the beginning course is presented. Centering the introductory course on the feasibility report and shorter accompanying reports serves the engineer by permitting the design of a report which serves the reader. Such design demonstrates the writing process and dramatizes the relationship between the student-writer and the reader-client.""This article studies and determines the benefits for technical communicators using narrative to compose and edit software requirements specifications. Specifically, this article is an examination of requirements specifications written for a Web-based radiology application serving the medical industry. Method: The study adheres to the usability principle that successful design accommodates complex problem solving. Requirements specifications, the application, and the application's code are examined as part of the study. Results: The first determination is that composing detailed narratives within the requirements specifications can ensure flexible spaces for users, in this case doctors, to view, study, and manipulate data as they see fit. The article also acknowledges and accounts for the reality of low-level or code-level procedural programming required for creating such flexible spaces. The second determination is that employing narratological structures within requirements specifications also leads to technical inventions at the code level. Practitioners will have a better understanding of how their work facilitates the development of a software application's functionality, design, and even code. Conclusion: Ultimately, narrative is the suggested method for developing the flexible affordances desired by usability specialists and it simultaneously helps negotiate low-level code.""In this study we apply compliance-gaining theory to actual memos to determine if the principles explain the content and style of the memos, written by managers to their subordinates. The memos represent two tasks of managers: reminding employees of accepted behavior they have neglected to follow and announcing changes in policies and procedures. A textual analysis shows that features of compliance gaining governing message production do explicate the power base, verbal strategies, and tactics, as well as the negotiating process underlying these memos. On the other hand, the advice for delivering bad news—buffer, reasons, implied refusal, and positive ending—does not describe the text of these memos. In addition, many contextual features are foregrounded in a compliance-gaining analysis of the memos. Compliance-gaining theory, with its grounding in organizational behavior, may be more appropriate in analyzing management memos than the bad news formula, which is based on sales principles. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Research question: How do color differences change affective processes and outcomes in computer-mediated communication? Literature review: Several previous studies exploring particular characteristics and learning in computer-mediated environments influenced the review of the literature. The literature on color psychology indicates that color preferences and affective reactions to color can influence behaviors and attitudes. The literature on goal achievement motivation posits that affective dispositions influence goal orientation, motivation, and individual outcomes. The literature on affect infers that affective reactions are responses to events, and these reactions influence attitudes and behaviors. The current study draws on these prior studies to examine affective reaction to color and learning outcomes in a computer-mediated learning environment. Methodology: We conducted a quasiexperimental study with 79 participants, who listened to a visual presentation lecture with either blue or yellow background and then completed a survey on their affective reactions, learning attitudes, and outcomes. Results and discussion: The results of our study indicate that color is not neutral and may influence learning attitudes and outcomes and, hence, the color of computer technology interface design can influence learning outcomes. Practitioners and academics must take people's affective reactions to color into account in designs and studies of visual information presentations. The sample size and the focus on two color hues (yellow and blue) may have some limitations on the conclusions and generalizability of this study. Future studies should examine more color hues and color saturation to further our understanding of affective reactions to colors and consequent impact on attitudes and behavioral outcomes. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""A construct mediated in digital environments, information communication technology (ICT) literacy is operationally defined as the ability of individuals to participate effectively in transactions that invoke illocutionary action. This study investigates ICT literacy through a simulation designed to capture that construct, to deploy the construct model to measure participant improvement of ICT literacy under experimental conditions, and to estimate the potential for expanded model development. Research questions: How might a multidisciplinary literature review inform a model for ICT literacy? How might a simulation be designed that enables sufficient construct representation for modeling? How might prepost testing simulation be designed to investigate the potential for improved command of ICT literacy? How might a regression model account for variance within the model by the addition of affective elements to a cognitive model? Literature review: Existing conceptualizations of the ICT communication environment demonstrate the need for a new communication model that is sensitive to short text messaging demands in crisis communication settings. As a result of this prefect storm of limits requiring the communicator to rely on critical thinking, awareness of context, and information integration, we designed a cognitive-affective model informed by genre theory to capture the ICT construct: A sociocognitive ability that, at its most effective, facilitates illocutionary action-to confirm and warn, to advise and ask, and to thank and request-for specific audiences of emergency responders. Methodology: A prepost design with practitioner subjects $({N}=50) $ allowed investigation of performance improvement on tasks demanding illocutionary action after training on tasks of high, moderate, and low demand. Through a model based on the independent variables character count, wordcount, and decreased time on task $(X)$ as related to the dependent variable of an overall episode score $(Y)$, we were able to examine the internal construct strength with and without the addition of affective independent variables. Results and discussion: Of the three prepost models used to study the impact of training, participants demonstrated statistically significant improvement on episodes of high demand on all cognitive model variables. The addition of affective variables, such as attitudes toward text messaging, allowed increased model strength on tasks of high and moderate complexity. These findings suggest that an empirical basis for the construct of ICT literacy is possible and that, under simulation conditions, practitioner improvement may be demonstrated. Practically, it appears that it is possible to train emergency responders to improve their command of ICT literacy so that those most in need of humanitarian response during a crisis may receive it. Future research focusing on communication in digital environments will undoubtedly extend these finding in terms of construct validation and deployment in crisis settings. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This article claims that the debate over research in professional communication is grounded in ideology. The article discusses the ideologies of two research perspectives: a functionalist perspective, common in much social scientific research, and a critical interpretive perspective, currently emerging in disciplines other than our own. The article sets recent discussions of research in professional communication within a functionalist framework, then posits that a critical interpretive ideology provides an alternative. The interests advanced by both perspectives are discussed, and the viability of critical interpretive research in professional communication is supported. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To assess the present, it looks at the past and explores the road we have followed to our present position. It includes suggestions on the pro per subject matter of research in our discipline, presents a taxonomy for identifying research interests and relationships, and identifies areas in which we have been prolific and those in which we find much uncharted terrain. In so doing, it compares the research interests of the American Business Communication Association and two other major communication so cieties. It comments on research direction (and misdirection) and on re search types, tools, and developments. It also comments on the quality philosophy, and objectives of research; and it suggests explanations for current emphases in our field, noting the stages of inquiry through which it has evolved.

However, before a product is released into the marketplace, its developers would like to predict its acceptability in the target market. One predictor of acceptability is usability test results. Typically, usability testing takes place outside of the user's natural environment in a usability test lab, an artificial environment. This article suggest ways in which ethnographic principles, historically used to describe a culture from the point of view of someone within that culture, can be used along with traditional usability testing to predict a product's acceptability in the marketplace.""Research activity is an integral component in the formation of professions. Evidence shows that business and technical communication specialists conduct research in both academic and practitioner career fields. In other disciplines, course work has been recognized as the primary means for preparing students to conduct and consume research. Yet, no publications document the status of research methods course work for U.S. students specializing in business and technical communication. This study provides a descriptive basis for assessing three areas in those courses: research methods topics, required readings, and teaching or assessment methods. An analysis of the results leads to a proposed agenda for preparing students specializing in business and technical communication for their future work roles in both academe and industry.""Personal-computer-based communications media--electronic mail, bulletin boards, and computer conferencing--have great potential for integrating scholarly and scientific research networks. Research networks, or informal organizations of faculty who share an interest in a research area, are central to scholarly and scientific progress. They have been critized, however, for their exclusion of young researchers and of faculty at isolated or low prestige institutions. Studies show that computer networking opens network access by obliterating social barriers and status distinctions. It has often been argued that, if used as a medium for research network communication, computer networking could democratize research networks. Personal computer information services designed for personal computer uses, as well as personal-computer-based bulletin board systems, represent the most promising avenues for research network communication owing to their low cost, flexibility, and egalitarian ethos.""Interdisciplinary research is often recommended and occasionally studied, but little has been written about the personal, practical, and methodological issues involved in doing it. In this article, the authors describe one particular research collaboration between a business communication scholar and an information systems researcher. They present their observations about the political pitfalls and personal benefits of their interdisciplinary collaboration. As they attempt to generalize from their experience, the authors conclude that politics in the broadest sense of the term is the most critical challenge to the conduct of interdisciplinary research. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Although scarcely explored to date, US patent records provide numerous opportunities for research in technical and scientific communication.

A medical editor edits manuscripts authored by physicians and scientists in biomedical specialties. A training program which combines academic and on-the-job training requirements has been conducted at a military medical center over a two-year period. One Resident has completed the on-the-job phase of the program. She has been a contributing biomedical communicator in the editorial office during this period and received a master's degree from a local university in May 1978. The support of the medical center, the dedication of the Preceptor, the vision of the Mentor, and the educational background, interests, aptitudes, potential, and persistence of the student selected to participate in the residency program have been contributing factors in making the program successful. This plan is a practical and economical approach to rewarding an institution for its investment and to training technical/biomedical communicators.""Technical communicators are expected to work extensively with visual texts in workplaces. Fortunately, most academic curricula include courses in which the skills necessary for such tasks are introduced and sometimes developed in depth. We identify a tension between a focus on technological skill vs. a focus on principles and theory, arguing that we subvert the potential benefits of an education if we succumb to the allure of software. We recommend several classroom practices that help educate students toward greater visual literacy, based not only on recommendations from the research but also from our experience as teachers of visual communication.""Reviewers of technical documents must often work with nonnative speakers (NNSs) of English. Drawing on research in cross-cultural pragmatics and institutional discourse, we discuss linguistic patterns that document reviewers are likely to use when commenting on NNS writing. We anticipate miscommunications that may arise from some of these linguistic patterns, especially when a reviewer attempts to be both clear (so that the writer understands the comments) and polite (so that the reviewer maintains positive working relations with the writer). We recommend specific linguistic strategies that allow reviewers to balance clarity and politeness most effectively when communicating with NNSs.""The article makes the point that teachers learn to teach technical writing by learning what good technical writing is and how technical writing is done by those who do it for a living. Such learning requires the teacher to tap every available resource, and this article tells what those resources are. Among the resources discussed are books and journals, libraries, off-campus contacts, professional organizations, and others.""Hostile challenges to planned organization change are common and challenging to deal with effectively. Little research has explained successful responses to such stakeholder hostility. To address this gap, we use the concept of readiness to characterize the content of hostile challenges. We also use rhetorical strategies based on speech act theory to describe options for responding to those challenges. Because change agents must choose among multiple strategies, we continue a line of research investigating relative preferences among them. Ultimately, our aim is to offer six lessons for change agents who face hostile challenges based on evidence from research. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""Research in business disciplines about work-force diversity has been inadequate in terms of precise conceptualization and theoretical grounding. Two psychological paradigms from training literature (cognitive and affective) are examined here, but, because of their inability to explain the sources and significance of organization-level change, sociological paradigms about dominance and intergroup dynamics are presented as viable theoretical supplements. Substantive sharing of power with diverse or nontraditional employees hitherto marginalized in U.S. organizations is proposed as one potentially effective response to managing work-force diversity. Systemwide structural changes in U.S. organizations of today are recommended for optimizing diversity. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Our intent was to include the many facets of communicating in the business environment under one all-encompassing discipline since executive communication, management communication, organizational communication, as well as presentation courses and many others, are all part of communicating in business. If those of us teaching in our field view ourselves as members of a specific discipline rather than a sub-area or stepchild of a larger academic field, our peers are more likely to see us as a legitimate academic discipline. According to Boulding, external and internal legitimacy are necessary for work to be viewed as legitimate. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""Standard in many professional communications classrooms is the teaching of the general business letter and sometimes, more specifically, the complaint letter.

This tutorial complements existing teachings on standard form-letter writing and could serve as a supplemental component to a marketing or management course. © 2010 IEEE.""American document design process models reflect the assumption that comprehension and usability are the most important characteristics of effective documents. But it is increasingly evident that other cultures value other communicative features of documents and that purposes and intentions vary across cultures. This case study examines the responses of four sets of American readers (three sets familiar with American document design research and practice and one set of content specialists—engineers by training) to the visual aspects of an annual report. The original document was prepared for a midsized Japanese corporation and published and distributed in Japan; the American version is an almost literal translation of the original document from Japanese to English, with no changes in visuals, graphic design, or format. Protocol analyses of readers’ responses revealed distinct patterns of expectations and preferences based on 1) cultural biases, 2) degree of familiarity with the American document design model, and 3) ignorance of Japanese culture and corporate communicative practices. This study raises questions about the effectiveness in terms of cultural sensitivity of what we have called the “American” document design process model and usability testing procedures, and calls for extensive collaborative research designed to describe and analyze current practice in international settings. © 1995 IEEE.""This paper discusses a writer's responsibility in terms of the technical craftmanship represented in his document, and of the writer's responsibility to his audience, his field, and his own professional stature.

Audience responsibility is defined in terms of the message conveyed.""Science reporting serves a critical role in educating and informing the public. In a democracy scientific and technological information takes on greater importance as the lay public assumes a decision making role in public policy. Examples of government and corporate information systems raise serious questions about what the public is told. Recent patterns in journalism and public relations only reinforce these problems. The science reporter/writer faces four important elements in trying to inform the public about scientific and technological developments. First, the issues are highly technical and have experts on both sides. Second, the issues are unresolved and the debate continues. Third, the issues revolve around man-made problems. Fourth, there is either great benefit or great risk depending upon which side you believe.""New technologies continue to be developed in audiovisual communications at a rapid rate.

A minority applicant's name, address, education, work history, extra curricular activities, and choice of references may trigger unfavorable assumptions by the reader and unfairly influence the selection process. To reduce the chances of “detection” and being eliminated prematurely, some minority students Anglicize their names, use street addresses of relatives and friends in more desirable parts of town, and downplay ethnic-specific education, jobs, and affiliations. Concealing one's ethnic background, however, may be difficult and, more important, may be counterproductive. Minority students should write resumes that are accurate and accentuate the achievements that a potential employer would focus on. Business communication instructors should address concerns about discrimination in selec tion and hiring as they help all students choose the appropriate resume format and language to present their best selves. © 2003, Sage Publications.

The alternative policy courses may all be reasonable, and yet none of them may be clearly best for all stakeholders; support for an option must be cultivated through public rhetoric. Loci communes and Burkean transcendence are two potent rhetorical strategies that can help business leaders publicly weigh and civilly advocate a policy position relative to competing alternatives. This article develops and illustrates that argument by analyzing the public rhetoric involved in AirTran's attempt to build support for its hostile takeover of Midwest Airlines and Midwest's successful resistance to that attempt. Midwest's deft development of the transcendent term value helped it circumvent the initial deadlock between its preferred loci communes (i.e., the existent and quality) and AirTran's (i.e., the possible and quantity). The article advances a rationale and call for rhetorical scholarship to adopt more situated, social practice views of loci communes and transcendence. © 2009 Sage Publications.""While scholars and practitioners agree that human conditions provide the social framework from which technical information is created, our profession lacks agreed-upon practices for emphasizing humanistic aspects in our work. On the one hand, humanistic aspects can foreground the people involved in technical information and emphasize the social “subject” and the scientific “object” in knowledge-making. On the other hand, humanistic aspects can send unintended messages—oftentimes generating negative perceptions of technical information. This article furthers our understanding of how we use humanistic aspects in technical communication. After discussing the positive effects of using humanistic aspects in fatalgrams (mining industry accident reports), this article presents cases in which humanistic aspects generated negative perceptions of knowledge and which support a rationale for rethinking our uses of humanistic aspects in technical information. Last, this article offers a framework, based on an ethic of care, to guide decisions about knowledge-making with regard to human relationships."Proposes that technical and professional communication instructors reconsider their treatment of plagiarism Examines approaches to teaching about plagiarism and the need for rethinking plagiarism in light of contemporary workplace practice."In a profound sense, the teaching of business and technical communication (BTC) is always already the teaching of writing in the disciplines (WID).

The description is based on three empirical studies of professional writing practices. It includes the goals of review, the actors involved in the process, the moments in the text production process that review is taking place, and the procedures followed. The studies make clear that review serves more goals than just improving the text. For improving the text, other methods than review probably produce better and more reliable results, especially when the goal is to improve the usability of the text. But review also has the function of having the information checked by experts and of building consensus and commitment in the organization. Because in most organizations review is taking place anyway, all remarks about the quality and acceptability of the document that are collected in the review process can be considered additional information that writers could use - with caution.""The present confusion over what technical communication is or ought to be is a temporary condition brought on by challenges like those issued by Paul Anderson, John Brockmann, and Jack Selzer. They have raised important issues which challenge practices and assumptions which many in the field have accepted tacitly. However, the weaknesses they have identified in the disciplines of theory and pedagogy do not necessarily indicate the failure of those disciplines to come of age. Thomas Kuhn's concept of ″paradigm″ suggests that such criticism may actually indicate new growth in already mature disciplines."An historical approach to the study of the development of style manuals for book publishers and writers is undertaken. Guides of the ancient world are discussed and compared with the most widely used of today's manuals. Included is an evaluation of the changes that have occurred during this century. A shift from the publisher-oriented style manual to those with a greater concern for the needs and guidance of the author is seen. Today's spirit of cooperation appears to dominate the manuals that are now being published. The value of style manuals as a factor in helping to limit the ever-increasing costs in publishing is discussed and suggestions for improvement of format are presented."This teaching case describes the evolution of a course on content strategy aimed at advanced undergraduates and graduate students in the digital and professional writing programs at Michigan State University. The course has gone through three major shifts to reflect corresponding shifts in focus among professional and technical communicators: from developing content for the World Wide Web (original focus) to single sourcing; from single-sourcing to Enterprise Content Management Systems (ECMS), and from ECMS to content strategy. The case primarily focuses on the most recent shift. Research questions: How can a course on content strategy be useful to both advanced undergraduates preparing to enter the job market in industry and graduate students interested in learning theories in technical communication? In turn, how can a course on content strategy reflect current practices in industry while maintaining grounding for the course in academic research? Situating the case: Three emerging themes relevant to teaching content strategy emerge in the literature. The first is the role of the content strategist as an Editor-in-Chief, who creates a repeatable system for designing and managing all aspects of a website [1, 2, 3]. The second is the need to develop strategies for addressing stakeholders, especially clients and users, whose goals are to learn more about why they should invest in an organization and its broader vision. The third is adapting content for reuse, which involves designing content that can be easily accessed through various platforms and formats. How the case was studied: This is an experience report by the four faculty members who, together, have taught every section of the course in the last 15 years. Two of the instructors also participated in the course as students. About the case: The most recent version of the course is a one-term course that teaches theory and best practices for managing dynamic and distributed web content, while also incorporating assignments that help students practice content strategies with real clients. It addressed these issues with the previous version that focused on content management by collaborating with industry practitioners to help students understand the real-world implications of developing strategies for and creating web content with clients and organizations. It specifically addresses three themes identified from the literature - emphasizing the role of the content strategist as an Editor-in-Chief, differentiating the needs of clients and users, and designing for reuse. Course assignments include a landscape analysis of content-management systems and strategies used by various companies, designing content templates for specific clients, and developing a content strategy for a client selected by student groups. Key issues to address when developing the most recent version of the course included creating a course that was useful to graduate and undergraduate students aiming to enter content strategy professions, developing a balance between theory and practice in course readings and assignments, and revising a course to reflect current industry demands for skills in content strategy. Results: Anecdotal evidence from students is that the course was successful and acts as a defacto capstone for the program. Through their course evaluations and unsolicited follow-up emails, students exiting the most recent version of this course became valuable assets who help organizations develop big-picture strategies for adaptable content to be shared through various platforms. Conclusion: A course on content strategy that incorporates current industry perspectives helps graduate and undergraduate professional writing students become more adequately prepared for their future professions working with organizations.

To avoid one of the possible disadvantages of using focus groups, namely, sequencing or dominance problems, the method was combined with a troubleshooting text evaluation method: the plus-minus method. The combined approach produced valuable information about complex acceptance and relevance problems - information that could not easily have been obtained with other methods - part of which became available only after extensive discussion, during which opinions often changed. Information from the focus groups appeared to form a solid basis for decisions on revising or maintaining the text. Group discussion of critical remarks clarified whether the problems were related to the text or the company situation in which the manual functioned. In this way, problems with the text could sometimes be avoided by changing the situation or by explaining the situation to the readers."This article reports on an effort by the authors to use usability testing as a component of online teacher training for their multimajor technical communication course. The article further explains the ways in which program administrators at other institutions can create their own usability testing protocols for formative online teacher training in course design and in principles of user-centered design. © 2017 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing"Infographics exist on nearly any topic you can imagine, proliferating in the digital age with social media. As this genre continues to explode in the business scene, business and professional communication instructors can no longer ignore showing their students infographics. After first defining the genre and outlining how it situates itself within business and professional communication, this article offers two approaches to increase awareness and exposure of infographics for students. The first focuses on an analysis assignment using infographics; the second focuses on a production assignment. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication."Reviews past and current resources related to the plain language movement.

This paper discusses the elements of persuasion, emotion and pleasure, balance, perception, dynamics, style, form, and shape as they apply to both the concept being communicated and the typographic medium. © 1988 IEEE""As a concept of rhetoric in technical writing, relevance involves an awareness of time. The report deals with the past; the manual, with the present; the proposal, with the future. To be considered relevant, however, all the modes of technical writing must relate to the present reality of the audience. Writers must recognize this need not only as it influences grammar and style but also as it affects larger concerns of organization and tone. Realizing that the temporal classification of modern reports, manuals, and proposals correlates with Aristotle's designation of forensic, epideictic, and deliberative discourse, technical writers can discover a body of rhetorical theory on which to base choices about selection, arrangement, and presentation of subject matter.""Rhetoric has traditionally been associated with philosophy and politics, with social and institutional good. Scientific and technical communication was originally so associated in the works of Francis Bacon but became disassociat ed from politics for historical reasons reflected in the works of Herbert Spencer and John Dewey. Because of changes in science and technology symbolized by Albert Einstein, however, science itselfhas become more political. In response to these changes, technical communication ought to reestablish its traditional association with politics. Specifically, it ought to adopt a rhetorical approach to communication about scientific and technological problems that affect the social and institutional good. © 1987, Sage Publications.

This relationship between content and rhetoric means that the English teacher can base his evaluation of the written work of science and engineering students on these three axioms: Axion I. Poor rhetoric signals poor technical knowledge. Axiom II. Poor rhetoric manifests unscientific thinking. Axiom III. Poor rhetoric demonstrates a lack of concern for engineering values.""The instructor and students in a technical writing class constitute a complex organizational unit with an array of interests, needs, values, and agendas. The need to negotiate and define both shared and conflicting goals and assumptions presents a richly problematical rhetorical situation. In this context, we can use the old standard organizational genre, the memo, in ways that are both rhetorically and pedagogically rich, helping students to write themselves—and their instructors—into a more vital, satisfying, and effective learning environment. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In particular, we do not know how user-derived data are applied by professional designers in their decision-making arguments. Research questions: (1) What kinds of evidence and appeals do advocates of user-centered design use when supporting claims within design decision-making sessions? (2) How do evidence and appeals used by professional designers compare to evidence and appeals used by previously studied novice designers? Literature review: Previous research of user-centered design that also incorporates data-driven personas has concluded that while some observed groups dedicated to user-centered design see personas as a way to further improve upon user-centered design methods, personas rarely become an integrated part of the design process and are often not incorporated in recommended ways. Prior research of decision-making within the design process has concluded that decision-making is a highly variable, but often deeply collaborative activity that can be assessed through a variety of argumentative lenses, including the Toulmin model of argument. Methodology: In this case study, a one-week, onsite exploratory observation was conducted in the workplace of professional designers. All meetings were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Postobservation interviews were also conducted with the participants. A discourse-based analysis was conducted on the transcriptions to identify the various types of rhetorical appeals and evidence used by the designers during their decision-making meetings. Results and conclusions: This onsite observation found that this particular group of designers supported about 50% of their claims with evidence, with 5.1% of the evidence in support of a claim referencing user data, and 33.4% of evidence in support of a claim referencing the designer's own opinion. These results suggest, among other things, that personas (the key user-centered design tool used by the observed group) are perhaps not necessarily a helpful rhetorical tool for persuasion in decision-making meetings, that designers who conduct user research are more likely to reference user data in support of claims, that these designers might have a broad notion of what constitutes user data, and that prior experience can serve as a powerful persuasive force. In addition, appeals to user data were the least common type of appeal employed by the novice and professional designers. However, this exploratory study is limited by the condensed observation time and its single group of designers. Future studies may use the methodology established here to explore the uses of evidence of additional groups. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Computer-mediated communication (CMC) via the Internet is fast becoming a significant communication medium for technical and professional communicators. Research emerging from a number of disciplines is beginning to articulate the numerous social and organizational factors involved in the use of CMC. A significant question for communicators to ask is how organizations, which traditionally prefer structured and accountable communication, can exist in the open-ended and unregulated world of the Internet. A rhetorical analysis of the protest over Lotus MarketPlace illustrates the complexity of traditional corporate communication in the nonhierarchical and often highly emotive forum of the Internet. Organizations can interact within this complexity more successfully by changing their rhetorical strategies. © 1995 IEEE.""Professionals involved in the creation of text-based communication face a number of challenges. These include overburdened and often uninterested users juxtaposed with the writer's desire to communicate relevant topical information. Uninvolved users are likely to ignore the message. This may be exacerbated by increases in text length designed to increase the amount and/or detail of information to be communicated. An experiment was conducted to examine the effect of rhetorical figures in text headings as to how users read and process the text (hereafter, readership, as used in marketing). To the extent that higher levels of text readership increase user knowledge and skills, enhance topic-related attitudes, and facilitate beneficial topic-related behaviors, higher readership should yield desirable communication outcomes. Headings with rhetorical figures were hypothesized to enhance readership, particularly under conditions generally associated with relatively low readership, namely, lower perceived information relevance and longer text. Results generally support rhetorical figures' abilities to enhance readership, especially with longer texts.""White papers are commonly produced by for-profit organizations to market high-tech products and services and are often created by technical writers. But writers of this genre have little evidence-based research to guide them. To fill this void, the authors tested a rhetorical move structure with a sample of 20 top-rated marketing white papers and found that, despite the lack of industry standards for white papers, those written for marketing purposes display similar rhetorical moves: introducing the business problem, occupying the business solution niche, prompting action, establishing credibility, and providing disclaimers or legal considerations. Based on the results of this study, the authors advance guidelines for writers of this genre and suggest areas for future research. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""This paper examines the development of sales genres in mainland China in the pre-reform period (1949-78) and the reform period (1978 to the present). In the first period, sales qingshi (requests raised by subordinates), sales pifu (official replies), and sales tongzhi (circulars) were used. In the second period, sales qingshi and pifu disappeared while sales letters and sales invitations began to appear. In addition, sales tongzhi have evolved in response to changes in the economic context. All of these sales genres are related to the three larger genres in Chinese written discourse: xiaxing wen (the superior writing to the subordinate), shangxing wen (the subordinates writing to the superior) and pingxing wen (equals writing to each other). In the history of Chinese written discourse, these three genres reflect the social structure. Changes in the social structure are the fundamental reason for changes in specific sales genres. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""Using cultural empowerment as a conceptual framework, this study emphasizes the interrelated role of culture, rhetorical agency, and empowerment in discursive analysis and communicative practice. Twelve black business owners were interviewed using a narrative inquiry approach. Thematic analysis revealed that these entrepreneurs enacted rhetorical agency in ways that work within oppressive systems and resisted damaging dominate discourses about black businesses. By highlighting the rhetorical narratives of black entrepreneurs, this study also addresses the need for a more culturally sensitive approach in business, professional, and organizational communication. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.""Engineers' use of rhetoric differs from that of scientists because of the material objects engineers work with and the material conditions under which they act. For engineers, ""publication"" takes the form of releasing a marketable object, not a refereed article. Thus, they have less need than scientists do to create written theoretical work and can instead build knowledge by group discussion of instrument traces that they tie directly to the object. The fact that they usually work in hierarchical, for-profit organizations also affects their rhetorical practices, as they must shape the actions of those both below and above them in the corporate hierarchy.""Survey and anecdotal evidence indicates that universities do not prepare students well for writing in the workplace. One important reason for this failure is that rhetorical theory dominates the teaching of technical communication in the academy. Though extremely influential in the academy, rhetorical theory is inappropriate for teaching some kinds of important workplace communication (instructions, online documentation, computer-human interfaces, indexes), and it does not address important skills that practicing technical communicators need. Instrumental discourse differs from rhetoric in its purpose, in its absence of reasons and argumentation, in its task-oriented approach, in its emphasis on accessibility, and in its emphasis on economics. As a result, instrumental discourse is much more appropriate for the genres and skills that practicing technical communicators use, and it offers significant advantages to students, and in the long run, to the academy itself.""Entrepreneurship has undergone significant transformations in the past decade due to crowd-based models of innovation and the increasing popularity of crowdfunding. Crowdfunding provides an alternative to the way entrepreneurs traditionally raise start-up and operational funds for a venture. Moreover, with crowdfunding platforms, citizens and communities are increasingly able to engage in entrepreneurial work not only for profit but also to address social and civic problems. Problem: Given the expanding boundaries of entrepreneurship, it is increasingly important for professional and technical communication teachers to prepare students to be ethical entrepreneurs and embody a widening array of rhetorical skills. Our teaching case addresses the question of how we might incorporate new and emerging forms of entrepreneurship, such as crowdfunding, into the professional and technical communication classroom in ways that foreground the social, civic, and ethical dimensions of that work. Situating the case: To address this question, we first situate our teaching case in relevant literature from professional and technical communication and social entrepreneurship, and then compare it with similar cases of crowdfunding being used for educational purposes. How the case was studied: We describe what we observed before, during, and after teaching a project structured thematically around civic crowdfunding. We had two sources of data: (1) a collection of teaching materials, including syllabi, day-to-day lesson plans, project prompts, in-class activities, correspondence between instructors, and informal teaching logs used to record impromptu reflections throughout the course of the semester; and (2) the civic crowdfunding project materials produced by students. About the case: Two distinct but related problems have motivated the development of this teaching case: (1) the context of 21st-century entrepreneurship has rapidly changed as a result of new approaches, including crowdfunding; (2) this shift has also led to an increased emphasis on civic and social matters of concern, which have increasingly become more important in contemporary business models. Ultimately, we seek to understand how entrepreneurial writing projects can meld commercial and financial motivations with civic exigencies, direct participation, and stakeholder engagement. As such, this civic crowdfunding sequence takes place over two phases: (1) students conducted primary and secondary research on a local problem or exigency and used this as evidence for a white paper and a project proposal; (2) students developed a feasible solution to this problem which then formed the basis for crowdfunding campaign materials, including a Kickstarter page, campaign video, and branding materials. Results: Our results focus on two projects that clearly foreground a social and civic mission; we point to these two projects not as perfect examples, but rather as illustrative cases of how students engaged crowdfunding as a form of civic entrepreneurship. Conclusions: Our teaching case has demonstrated the need to prepare students not only to pitch venture ideas for a small audience of investors, but also to consider how to identify and frame problems, construct stories about these problems as pressing matters of concern and, ultimately, develop ethical relationships with stakeholders and increasingly diverse investors. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Drawing on a survey of the content management (CM) discourse, the author highlights CM trends and articulates best practices in content strategy that CM thought leaders are helping organizations adopt. These trends and practices are changing the nature and location of rhetorical work in organizations that produce intelligent content. In these contexts, rhetorical work is located primarily in the complex activity of building content strategy frameworks that govern text-making activities.

Many explanations for the reversal of EPA's cleanup plan at Aspen could be advanced, but we concentrate on the definition of risk communication upon which EPA's internal risk communication guidelines are based—guidelines that its field representatives are invited to follow. In particular, we now explore ownership messages conveyed through metacommunication conflict with EPA's risk communication guidelines. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

As a public space, the Center uses fact sheets, posters, and three-dimensional displays to make arguments about the storage of nuclear waste; we argue that the physical space, text, displays, and online space are all elements of risk communication. We offer a new way to read these elements of risk communication and suggest potential opportunities for public agency.""Experienced politicians seem acutely sensitive to the risks of dealing with hypothetical questions and use various techniques to avoid responding.

Yet, even though we recognize the rapid growth in this field, we know only a little about the special teaching and consulting functions of communication practitioners. This survey of in-house trainers, personnel generalists, and external consultants reveals a process by which practitioners develop an interpersonal relationship between target group and trainer. This process, in turn, may contribute to role conflicts as practitioners attempt to justify the scope and cost of com munication training while preserving the relationship with their client. © 1979, Sage Publications.

Four specific programs of interaction now in effect at Battelle Memorial Institute and Ohio State University provide Battelle personnel ready access to information on the state-of-the-art of rhetorical theory and assure them of a large pool of well trained writers as potential employees. The technical writing faculty gains confidence and a better understanding of the tasks typically performed by technical writers over long periods of time. Description of these particular programs of interaction suggests ways to foster similar programs elsewhere, even in the absence of nearby research foundations."This paper describes the suggestions for improvement made by nine colleagues about an article written by the author. These suggestions are placed in categories and examples of each are provided. The suggestions are then compared with those provided by a set of computer-based text-editing programs. The results suggest that both the contributions of humans and computers are limited in certain respects. Text-editing programs can deal well with textual issues (perhaps better than humans) but humans have prior knowledge and expertise about content which programs currently lack. An optimal approach would be to combine computer-based and human aids to writing and to explore further how computer-based programs can be made to match human skills."The National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) is directed to evaluate the effects of the new copyright law with respect to new, developing technologies.

However, such teams lack a common context, and knowledge gaps exist among dispersed team members making collaboration difficult. This paper seeks to examine whether and how properties of team context (e.g., familiarity with team members and task) have the potential to moderate the effects of structure of team context (e.g., dispersion) on dispersed team collaboration. Further, this paper teases out these effects in teams with a varying extent of dispersion. Findings offer evidence that a unique constraint of distance that dispersed teams face may not be the key factor that determines their performance. © 2011 IEEE.""The author advocates developing language awareness as an essential communication skill for preventing or ameliorating occupational burnout.

In some scientific fields, however, there is a sufficiently well developed market for products that advertising income becomes a more than significant potential source of revenue. In such cases, it is financially possible to produce technical publications that are both inexpensive to purchase (less than 10 annual subscription) and that have large circulations (sometimes 30,000 or more paid subscribers). Such publications - technical magazine/journal hybrids - have a number of advantages, chief among which is the opportunity to give subscribers a great deal more for their money, but they also present difficulties for the publisher. Among these difficulties are the unpredictable nature of advertising support and the consequent difficulties in budgeting, the need to maintain high circulation, and the editorial challenges inherent in serving a large and possibly heterogeneous readership. These points are illustrated with reference to two American Chemical Society publications that are ″hybrid″ in nature, Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Science and Technology.""During the past 30 years the technical report has developed into an important primary medium of communication in science and technology, to the extent that it is sometimes seen as a threat to primary journal publication. At the same time the (unclassified) report has been accused of not meeting the same standards of authority, scientific rigor, and retrievability as conventional journal publication. Report publication is reviewed in the light of standards commonly accepted for journal publication, and the inherent characteristics of technical reports are assessed. It is concluded that both reports and scientific journals have distinct roles to play in the communication of scientific and technical information, and that a cost-effective system will make full use of the strengths of both.""Discussed are some elements and techniques of editing from the author's experiences as an editor in Australia and which may be applicable to other countries.

The fact that several companies usually prepare competitive proposals for the same potential contract increases the importance of an effective presentation. Each proposal represents a formidable hurdle in the race for profits and survival. The purpose of this paper is to briefly outline what an effective proposal is and define the engineer's role in preparing one."Argues that Web designers and users communicate through personas and that the success of a site depends largely on how well these personas suit the purposes of both  Presents guidelines that designers should ask as they construct and evaluate a site."This article analyzes the ideological assumptions that have driven the conception and development of hypertext, demonstrating how it has developed from an apractical romantic viewpoint that remains a very strong driving force.

This study examines consequences for the local instantiation of the police use-of-force policy genre in the wake of a controversial shooting in Denver, Colorado, and traces ways in which the formation of a multi-interest task force charged with revising the police department's policy altered the policy's conventional activity system.

However, this article analyzes two Russian teaching contracts, rhetorically comparing purpose and audience, culture, gender, and the role of the individual versus the state. For historical, political, and economic reasons, less documentation is used in business transactions in Russia than is used in the United States. Subsequently, communication scholars have been afforded little opportunity to analyze Russian business documents. This study uses anecdotal episodes as a framework for examining Russian culture and analyzing university teaching contracts, concluding that the contracts are not only brief and factual but also reflect a more oral, less litigious environment than Western countries like the United States.""The Self-Actualizing Case Method (SACM) employs a participative management approach to provide trainees with the authority and responsibility for carrying out the case presentation, analysis, and peer evaluation.

In 2000, the EU ruled that the United States (US), through its voluntary Safe Harbor program, met that requirement. Since that time, however, the EU has charged that many US companies that claim to be in compliance with Safe Harbor policies are not. In this article, I report on a study of the privacy-policy statements of 20 randomly selected US companies that claim to be in compliance. Of the 20, 19 are not in compliance. This study argues that as EU Member States begin to examine Safe Harbor carefully, they are likely to force US companies to adhere to more stringent privacy policies.

Through an examination of talk-in-interaction with a thorough description of relevant embodied actions, the author analyzes how meeting participants co-construct social roles by employing different uses of free-standing ok. More specifically, the author focuses on two different uses of free-standing ok in business meetings: ok with averted eye gaze and ok with maintained eye gaze. The author addresses the question of how the chairperson uses free-standing ok to accomplish different actions and to perform ""doing-being-facilitator."" By describing where the chairperson looks while producing ok, I also discuss how the chair manages both the coordination of face-to-face interaction and the practical task of facilitating the progress of a meeting.""Although Samuel Johnson is best known for his poetry, prose fiction, essays, criticism, and dictionary (the first one in English to deserve the title), he also produced a small body of technical writing. These writings include prefaces to the technical works of others and two technical pieces of his own: one on determining longitude at sea and the other on stresses in bridge designs. These works are of interest to contemporary technical writers for the clarity and conciseness of Johnson's explanations of difficult and complex matters. Of more general interest is the range of Johnson's knowledge and his ability, evidenced in these works, to grasp immediately the essentials of a subject.""The number three has a strong psychological appeal. Grouping thoughts or saying things in a series of three - three points, three qualities, three reasons - attracts attention, creates rhythm, and facilities memory.

Levels of readers' knowledge represented schema theory while message coherence represented text-centered theory. Newly developed instruments measured background knowledge and reader understanding. Text reading material was also developed. The research design consisted of a 2 × 2 factorial with business and nonbusiness subjects. The primary conclusion is that background knowledge (schema theory) affected a reader's ability to understand business communication. However, coherence (text-centered theory) did not affect understanding. Because coherence is only one textual quality, this study demonstrates the importance of additional research on the variables that affect reader understanding. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""Schizophrenic disorders, perhaps the most serious of severe mental disorders, develop in adulthood in about 1% of the population.

A stratified random sample of faculty from 21 midwestern universities was selected to complete a 20-item survey. One variable revealed gender differences: Men were more likely than women to perceive children and family responsibilities as constraints on their ability to do scholarly writing. A second variable approached significance: Women were more likely than men to identify themselves as doing theoretical work. Although the women and men in this survey reported to have published similar amounts, women were less likely to be associate and full professors than were men. This study suggests that the organizational culture and structure of academia privileges men. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

It shows that many of the accounts were widely optimistic and sensational in their claims about the potential uses of nuclear power, and suggests the reasons for the sensationalism and overconfidence in science and technology. The concluding section discusses the general implications for the present and future popularization of science and technology journalism and communication.""One method of assessing the opinions that physicians hold about science writers is to examine the public record, represented by two periodicals: the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine. The citations to the news media that appear in the indexes of the two journals during the last fifteen years yield thirty-four opinion pieces, consisting of editorials and letters to the editor. The timing and content of medical news are of particular concern to physicians. Specifically, they watch for violations of the Ingelfinger Rule and the press embargo system - policies designed to ensure that physicians have access to medical information before it becomes widely disseminated to the general public - as well as errors of medical fact.""Production of journals on microfiche provides such radically new possibilities for both publishers and subscribers that it can reasonably be described as a publishing revolution. For the publisher, using microfiche rather than print makes possible significant cost savings for black and white periodicals with circulations up to at least 50,000. It is even economically feasible to produce microfiche publications in full color. For many journals, the savings are so great that distribution can be by first-class mail, thus bypassing second-class mailing regulations and increasing the speed and reliability of distribution. If publishers pass along these savings to subscribers, the latter benefit from lower subscription costs. Although some individual subscribers will have to purchase microfiche readers, the low cost of a reader (approximately half that of an office typewriter) suggests they will be willing to make this investment. Most advantaged by microfiche publishing are libraries; they benefit not only from reduced subscription costs but also from elimination of the need for binding and for finding shelf space for bound volumes. The present predicament of scholarly libraries is so serious and the economic advantages of microfiche publishing are so great that libraries may exert a backward pressure on publishers to force them to use microfiche, whether they want to or not.""This article studies a set of scientific/technical articles published in Internet homepages. Focusing upon current trends on genre theory and the functional approach deployed by Halliday and Martin [1], linguistic features and schematic structure are analyzed in relation to more standard genres. The structural analysis suggests that these kind of texts imaginatively realize and assume the standpoint and main tenets of a lay audience that just consumes specific genres, most being analogous to the persuasive, manipulative, amusement-oriented genres of TV news stories, tabloids, and commercials. It is pondered that much of the ""technological utopianism"" (term used by Kling) [2] surrounding the ever increasingly standardized Internet discourse turns the Internet into a productive vehicle to sustain technoscience as modern myth by spreading and forging that utopian imagery into the audience's consciousness, and that scientists are taking fruitful advantage of the utopian, futurist, and often sensationalist accounts of the Internet as a formidable frame to advertise themselves and the deeds achieved in their laboratories.""If technical communication is to merit acceptance as a discipline, two things must happen. First, a general body of theory must be developed from which hypotheses can be generated and tested. Second, a significant number of technical communicators must become proficient researchers and regularly apply sound research procedures to analyze the problems facing the profession. This article provides an introduction to research and the research process. Its goal is to provide practical and theoretical insight into the process of research by focusing on the classifications of research, the technical and intellectual aspects of research methodology, and the evaluation of research findings.""Scientific and technical jargon - specialized vocabulary, usually Latinate - plays a vital role in scientific and technical communication. But its proper use continues to be a point of discussion because of our concern with audience adaptation, rhetorical exigence, rhetorical purpose, and ethics. We've focused on teaching students - and on convincing scientists, engineers, and other writers/speakers - to gear their specialized language to the recipients of their communication, to the occasion calling for their communication, to what they wish to accomplish through their communication, and to the ethical goals of safety, helpfulness, empowerment, and truth. These are exactly the sorts of things we should be doing. My contribution to this conversation is a reinforcement and, I hope, an extension of the argument that we should also be teaching and convincing students and professionals: 1) to fully appreciate what makes jargon either good or bad; 2) to carefully distinguish jargon usage from other aspects of scientific and technical style; and 3) to recognize that in every context, even in communication among experts, jargon should be used judiciously - that is, in the most helpful, least taxing way.""Borrowing from scientific logic, the technical writing teacher can demonstrate differences between the way researchers/writers solve problems and the way readers comprehend written reports that are roughly parallel to the differences between deductive and inductive logic. As three pyramid theories of writing and their application in university and industry classrooms demonstrate, learning both systems of logic and how to transpose one into the other enables students to understand and structure their information from their reader's viewpoint. In this logical context, opening with the conclusion finally makes sense to most writers.""Because the typical layman does not understand the scientific and technological accomplishments of our nation, a modern educational program must be created to bridge the gulf of misunderstanding between the scientist and the nonscientist. The underlying success of this creative program is founded on the effectiveness of technical communication.""In the field that investigates infectious brain diseases such as mad cow disease, the verbal and visual packaging of scientific visuals associated with identifying the agent, prion, its processes, and structure served the community ritual of establishing belief in a highly unorthodox phenomenon. Visual promotion fed into cultural expectations of single agents and simple processes, even though the actual agency and disease process have proven highly complex and perhaps unknowable. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""Proposes taxonomy that identifies the roles and designs of screen captures Suggests that screen captures help users switch attention, develop a mental model of the program, verify screen states, and identify and locate window elements and objects.""This study set out to validate the supportive role of screen captures for switching attention. Forty-two participants learned how to work with Microsoft Excel with a paper manual. There were three types of manuals: a textual manual, a visual manual with full-screen captures, and a visual manual with a mixture of partial- and full-screen captures. The findings show that participants in all conditions looked up from the manual to the screen on about 97% of the cases in which such a switch was called for. Rank order analyses showed that users of the visual manuals switched attention significantly more often than did users of the textual manual. No differences were found between conditions on learning effects and training time.""This paper calls for moderating the polarizations that too often define research attitudes and practices. Careful definitions of research and types of research can lead to a more balanced view. Descriptions of and solutions for three major categories of polarities—1) attitudes about research and who should conduct it, 2) impressions of what research is, and 3) conceptions about research methods and findings—form the basis for adjusting the extremes. With a nonpolarized concept the business communicator can become a more productive business communication researcher. © 1979, Sage Publications.

Through a visual rhetorical analysis of a patient record used in an optometry teaching clinic, this article illustrates that a genre's visual representations provide significant insights into the social action of that genre. These insights are deepened by an insider analysis of the patient record that highlights how content analyses of visual designs need to be elaborated by contextual considerations. A combined visual rhetoric and RGS analysis shows that clinical novices learn to interpret the record's visual cues to safely traverse the complex requirements of this apprenticeship genre. The article demonstrates that visual rhetoric research can meaningfully contribute to the understanding of genres by presenting an enriched contextual analysis achieved by consulting with context insiders. © 2007 Sage Publications.""This pilot study obtained baseline information on verbal and visual rhetorics to teach microscopy techniques to college biology majors. We presented cell images to students in cell biology and biology writing classes and then asked them to identify textual, verbal, and visual cues that support microscopy learning. Survey responses suggest that these students recognized some of the rhetorical strategies used and conflated others, revealing intriguing questions for further research in undergraduate microscopy education.""Virtual teams enable knowledge workers from around the globe to participate in a variety of projects through computer-mediated interactions. Given that many of these virtual teams, including those involved in open source software development and other systems development, may not have preassigned leaders, it is important to understand the factors that explain why an individual may be considered a leader by team members in other locations. Specifically, the factors information systems development (ISD) ability, contribution, knowledge transfer, and team cohesion are hypothesized to influence remote leader emergence in distributed ISD teams. The proposed model is tested in a study using ISD teams composed of student members from both the US and Scandinavia. ISD ability, contribution, and knowledge transfer in cohesive teams were found to be significant predictors of remote leadership emergence. The study also suggests that US and Scandinavian members do not use the same criteria for identifying remote team members as leaders and offers a theoretical explanation of the results. © 2009 IEEE.""The authors of this article, a researcher and a practitioner, revisit the collaborative process by which a training program addressing report writing for police officers was developed and implemented as a means of understanding why and how this collaboration was successful.

This study aims to ascertain the status of English communication education and English-medium instruction at a Korean engineering school and to offer workable suggestions for English communication training for Korean graduate engineering students. Research questions: Should English communication education be offered at the graduate level in Korean engineering schools? How could English communication education be improved for Korean graduate engineering students? Literature review: Studies of English communication education for graduate engineering students indicate that English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students have English needs to publish internationally and English needs for English-medium instruction classes and for after graduation. Furthermore, individual assistance and e-learning programs might strengthen English communication education and academic writing for EFL graduate engineering students. Methodology: An evaluation study was conducted at an institution that has been leading the wave of English as the language of instruction. We collected data from documents as well as through surveys of faculty and students in graduate engineering programs. Results and discussion: The study was conducted at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The results showed that students' English fluency is critical for the success of using English as a medium of instruction. To facilitate this fluency, universities need to establish an English communication center that provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to English language training. Faculty also need the services of such centers. It is also advised that a thesis writing course be customized according to students' actual writing and communication abilities and enhanced with collaboration between engineering faculty and English education faculty. © 2014 IEEE.""Many companies now offer their employees opportunities to telecommute. What variables influence an employee's decision to accept the opportunity? In this study, telecommuting workers responded to a vignette describing a manager and an employee at a time when the employee had been given the opportunity to apply for a telecommuting program. The vignette systematically varied (a) the manager's promptness in mentioning an employee mistake; (b) the manager's reaction to negative feedback; (c) the manager's loyalty to employees; and (d) the length of time the manager and employee had known each other. The results showed that relationship duration significantly affected whether respondents thought that the employee should telecommute. Managerial reaction to criticism and managerial loyalty significantly affected forecasts of the worker's and manager's working together successfully. The results suggest that relationship predictability (duration) may constrain, and that communication behaviors (reaction to criticism, and loyalty) may facilitate an individual's decision whether to telecommute (Bernardino, 1996). The results also support the concept of telecompetence (Warisse, 1996) which argues that interpersonal factors influence the adoption and use of new communication technologies. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""Instructions for operating a control panel were presented in five different formats: flowchart, logical tree, yes/no tree, decision table, and list. Subjects had to choose one out of eight buttons, depending on the settings of the control panel. The results show that the decision table resulted in more errors, and that both the decision table and the list took longer than the three other formats, which did not show mutual differences. It turned out that the subjects valued most the format they had been using, except for those who had worked with the list. It is suggested that the users' ease of orientation for a diagram's format, both during reading and after ""switching"" between equipment and instructional text, explains the differences between the formats.""This article deals briefly with when to use and when not to use eight types of graphs: arithmetic and semi-logarithmic line charts; column, bar, and pie charts; 100-percent column charts; frequency distribution charts; and pictorial charts.

Using a new process—silence—for developing listening skills, this study compared the effects on perceived listening effectiveness of a self- imposed period of silence versus attending a lecture on listening skills versus a combination of a self-imposed period of silence and attending a lecture. While no significant differences were found for either lecture or silence or the combination of the two on measures of perceived listening effectiveness, qualitative data from journals kept by the participants suggest that the act of self-imposed silence greatly improves awareness of one's listening effectiveness and the value of developing beneficial listening skills. © 2003, Sage Publications.

One must differentiate the varieties of freedom to better understand how different interests manipulate the freedom mythology to achieve different ends. This study examines the scholars who have framed the hypertext debate and the rhetoric employed by the companies that want to sell it to locate a more complex picture of how these interests use the freedom myth. Such consideration leads to discussion of what might shape hypertext's emergence as more than an information-dispersal system.""To achieve important medical advances rapidly in a public climate of goodwill, effective communication is imperative between the laboratory scientist and lay person; between the scientist and business person; and between business and its various constituencies. Public relations is taking a more active role in explaining arcane science, and developing sound strategies to win public understanding and support. This requires developing new channels of communication-both outside and inside the company-to bring management into more direct positive contact with the scientist, the lay person, the investor, the reporter, and all other parties. © 1989 IEEE""Although problems resulting from ambiguity in technical discourse are generally recognized, few studies provide examples of actual instances. Specifically, the problem known as bypassing has not been fully explored. This paper therefore examines an important historical example, the medical term antiseptics, to show the impact that bypassing can have on communication of technical information. The term antiseptics was in use for over 150 years before Joseph Lister adopted it in the 1860s to describe his new system of surgical treatment. A review of published responses of Canadian doctors to Lister's writings indicates that confusion arose owing to the fundamentally different perceptions of the term for Lister and his audience. © 1988 IEEE""Collaborative tools typically employ linear threading for representing and organizing the contributions of the discussants. We argue that linear representations provide little support for the conceptualization, contextualization, and visualization of the discussion. To address these drawbacks, we propose the usage of semantic networks for representing discussions. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of semantic network representation to discussions through the development of a prototype named CollectiveThought. We also test some of the potential benefits of semantic network discussion representation with an empirical study. More specifically, we compare these two modes of discussion representation (i.e., linear versus semantic network) in terms of effects on the communication process as measured by perceived contextualization and on the communication outcome as measured by mutual understanding, using both subjective and objective indicators. The results show that semantic network discussion representation leads to a higher level of perceived contextualization and better mutual understanding. © 2006 IEEE.""Writing faults can be comprehended under a powerful concept from information theory. The concept is ″semantic noise″ , the noise of meanings. Implied in this concept is the possibility of analyzing writing faults quantitatively.

The dangers of misunderstood communication come from our being intentionally oriented or word-bound. People often seek truth in high abstractions that are many verbal steps removed from reality rather than concerning themselves with the facts. The author feels that both business writing and journalism are too often regarded as lower forms of English. Writing is viewed not as an art form but as a tool or tactic. Practical semantics involves the use of symbols for understanding, thinking, informing, and persuading. ""This new course combines the four basic communication skills of reading, writing, speaking, and listening with the research and reasoning skills needed to give communication meaning. The course is based on a series of semi-programmed exercises that are tightly integrated to progressively introduce the student to more complex tasks as the course progresses. The semi-programmed exercises also make it possible for instructors, through the use of the principles of delegation and management by exception, to efficiently teach larger classes than is possible with traditional methods. Research has shown that in these large classes, students significantly improve their performance. The students themselves rated the course as being one of the most valuable they had taken in preparing them for writing term papers, participating in discussion groups, and preparing them for success in their post-college years.* © 1978, Sage Publications.

Data are based on participant observation, formal and informal interviews, focus groups, and document analysis, including presentations, meeting notes, and e-mail correspondence. Drawing on the concepts of sensemaking, identity construction, and habitus, analysis of the members' stories suggests three key conclusions: reliance on collectively constructing stories; use of stories to deal with ambiguity and anxiety; and use of stories to construct and regulate identity. When viewed through a narrative lens, these results illuminate the interconnection of storytelling and networking strategies in a women's resource network that provides a hybrid of both expressive and instrumental benefits. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication."Readability of professional technical material was assessed by scientists and engineers. Less than 33 percent proved ″easy″ to read and understand. Further investigation showed that sentence structure had the greatest effect on readability."In most textbooks on technical writing, understandability of sentences is misleadingly equated with grammatical primitiveness. In actual technical writing, however, writers regularly conform to six basic rules dealing with the uses of base clauses and free modifiers, as well as punctuation. There are ten types of free modifiers, which can be used singly or in parallel or nonparallel sequences. All types are used either to add details to a key idea expressed in a base clause or to make transitions between one sentence or paragraph and another.""Regular journal publication becomes less effective as specialties become narrower and reader interest spans a broader range of subjects. Journals also are subject to some time delays due to their periodic publishing schedules. Publication of separate articles can overcome these problems, but in turn require strong information retrieval system support, a method of establishing a good technical profile of readers, an author recognition system that gives equivalent credit to being published in a journal, and a strong marketing department. If separate publications are properly designed, they can be self-supporting, without page charges, in technical areas that are not practical for journal publication. Separates can also automatically operate in regular journal areas. A valuable by-product of separate publications is an automatic tally of the people interested in or working on a specific technical project. Covered in the paper are the editorial, peer jury, production, distribution, and management systems associated with the Society of Automotive Engineer's method of primary publication in separate format.""One business school addressed the ""zeitgeist"" of the financial crisis by introducing in its inaugural seminar the cultural and ethical values too often absent from the types of transactions students are trained to manage. Drawing from cross-cultural and communication studies, the author tested ""serious games""-cultural situations and personal development exercises aimed at rewarding rule-based cooperation, interpersonal communication, and cultural empathy. Observations made during the games fostered curriculum reform by integrating humanistic concerns considered vital for international finance careers. Linking such training to business learning objectives enhances accountability, rule-based action, and cultural awareness reform. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""Teachers at all levels of college instruction use service learning, a popular pedagogical tool since the mid-eighties, to teach students both social consciousness and pragmatic, real-world writing skills. This article explores the concept of service learning as rhetorical action in the field of technical communication in general, and the question of whether service learning is appropriate in beginning level technical writing courses. Using my experience through two years of service learning instruction in community college classes, I respond to the charge that students in lower-division courses may lack the maturity to successfully enact service learning assignments. I also analyze the appropriateness of the community college as a catalyst for community-based writing projects.""This study examined the relationship between service providers' sociality usage and customer satisfaction with the service provider: The Service Provider Sociality Scale (SPSS) was administered to 250 undergraduate students enrolled in a small, midwestern college and 194 residents from locales near the college. Whether it was a professional (doctor; hairdresser) or nonprofessional (convenience store clerk, fast-food employee) service provider; regression analyses revealed that ""courteous expressions"" and ""personal connection"" socialities were positive for both occupational groups; however; a stronger relationship existed for professional service providers. Nevertheless, regardless of service provider occupational type, courteous expressions explained significantly more unique variance in customer satisfaction than did personal connection socialities. Therefore, the communicative actions of service providers may influence customer perceptions of commitment and affect economic prosperity across service entities. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper reviews major sources used, describes the wide variety of methods and programs, tells how to locate employers and how to administer programs, and covers some special problems of cooperative education.

Clarity, a function of the target audience, is analyzed according to its seven components: brevity, accuracy, completeness, order, emphasis, consistency, and objectivity.""""The seven habits of highly effective people"" (S. Covey, 1989) has become a classic precisely because Covey's principles are applicable to both personal and professional responsibilities-from building a stronger relationship with one's family to becoming a more effective leader within one's business organization. I have tried to suggest some ways that Covey's paradigm might help us rethink the way that we approach the writing process. This article is my interpretation of how we can apply Covey's seven habits to writing. The habits are: (1) be proactive; (2) begin with the end in mind; (3) put first things first; (4) think ""win/win""; (5) seek first to understand, then to be understood; (6) synergize; and (7) sharpen the saw (i.e. self-renewal).""Finding a method to determine terrestrial longitude was critical in the early seventeenth century as countries attempted to establish territorial boundaries. The magistrate and natural philosopher Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (1580-1637) spent much of his life working on a solution to this problem. As an early technical communicator, he was concerned with the criteria of acceptable observations, the standardization of materials and methods, and the communication of results. He refined a variety of strategies to obtain these observations and ensure their accuracy. He persuaded missionary priests to make observations throughout the Levant by promising patronage and gifts or stressing practical applications in the solution to the problem of longitude and church calendar reform. Although Peiresc did not resolve the issue of determining longitude, his efforts did provide the basis for work by later astronomers.""This article interprets technical communication research about sex differences according to social role theory, which argues that sex differences are enculturated through experiences associated with social positions in the family and the workplace. It reevaluates technical communication research about sex differences in communicative and collaborative styles in the classroom and the workplace and about the effects of the double bind that women experience in the workplace. The article concludes with a recommendation that theoretical frameworks explaining sex differences remain flexible and able to account for social change.""Our survey of women who graduated in engineering from Kansas State University indicates that sexist language persists in the workplace, that women react to it in various ways, and that such language can engender sexist attitudes which often have deleterious effects on the company and its employees. We believe technical-writing teachers have some of the responsibility to sensitize students to exclusionary language. We show how that language violates professional ethical practices, demonstrate that some technical-writing text strivialize the issue of sexist language, and suggest methods and resources for teachers to use in the classroom. © 1990, Sage Publications.

In so doing, designers extracted from language a meaning structure and arranged it spatially as an ideogram—a word con-struct—within which there were reticulations or networks. Use of these traditional procedures is even more relevant in the new media as codification of language is an integral part of the design of electronically published documents and electronic interfaces. This paper addresses the relation of shape and color, which are two of the parts of a composition, and also their relation to the enmnrphen«mn of written language. A composition is seen as a gestalt which has shape and color within a geometric construct: this affects comprehension and meaning. Therefore, what is seen can be modified by changes in shape and color within a geometric construct: this modifies comprehension and meaning. One may appropriately distinguish between an active attitude to visual stimuli, which is prevalent in the conception of shape, but applies also to color, and a receptive attitude, which is encouraged by the perception of color, but applies also to shape. It is probably the expressive qualities, primarily of shape but also of color, that engage the actively organizing mind; the allusive qualities, primarily of color but also of shape, that spontaneously affect the passively receiving mind. Generally, it seems that composition is less comprehensible if its geometric construct is not based on both conceptual and perceptual values. © 1991 IEEE""Examines the implications of greater professionalism for the future directions of technical communication  Considers the role of academic programs and professional societies in shaping the future of the profession MARJ DAVIS is professor and founding chair of the technical communication department at Mercer University, Macon and Atlanta, GA, where she teaches in the BS and MS programs.

Training is often focused on analysis of faulty procedures or lack of procedures over a more systemic approach. This research explores the existence of the psychological construct of shared mindfulness and examines how it is communicatively constructed and enacted in a high-reliability environment. The qualitative study examines shared mindfulness in 10 aviation student dyads in a decision-making crisis situation to identify the communication behaviors of the construct and to determine whether shared mindfulness may lead to more effective pilot decisions. Findings reveal both the existence of shared mindfiduess as a communicative construct and seven inductively derived communication process categories that create shared mindfiduess in a dyadic situation. Those dyads demonstrating more communication behaviors of shared mindfiduess also made the most effective decisions. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Shared teaching, also known as team teaching, is an innovative way to balance teaching and research. Shared teaching benefits students by providing the perspec tive of two or more professors in one class. Such an approach also benefits profes sors by giving them more concentrated time for their research. A review of the lit erature on the topic and examination of two distinct shared teaching models show that shared teaching has advantages and challenges for both faculty and students and is a viable option for reallocating resources. © 2003, Sage Publications.

First, the project should be grounded in habits of thought appropriate for the field. Next, the class activity should give students the responsibility for putting these habits into practice. Finally, assessment should be distributed among a range of stakeholders and should be contextualized to give value to students' work beyond the classroom. © 2012 Copyright Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""This study explores factors affecting the implementation of intranets, which are the technology upon which many knowledge management (KM) systems are built. Because intranets facilitate sharing of employee knowledge, many believe that organizational culture will influence intranet implementation. The results of this study found that intranet implementation is facilitated by a culture that emphasizes an atmosphere of trust and concern for other people (ethical culture), flexibility and innovation (developmental culture), and policies, procedures, and information management (hierarchical culture). Management should ensure that the proper values are in place to optimize intranet implementation and facilitate knowledge sharing.""Speech-act theory can illuminate and unify the principles of written busi ness communication through its emphasis on intention, context, and language, especially in relation to the reader.

Technology, entertainment, and design (TED) talks represent a new genre of presentation characteristic of Jamieson’s notion of electronic eloquence in that presenters weave together an engaging narrative complete with a strong visual presence. This study applies Bandura’s social cognitive learning theory to explore how students make sense of TED talks. Students responded to two questionnaires in two different classes: a basic public speaking course and a technical communication course. The results suggest that students learn vicariously through viewing mediated presentations, thus shaping their view of public speaking as a coproduced, networked, and engaging narrative. The authors offer recommendations for communication practitioners related to electronic eloquence and the rhetorical tradition. © The Author(s) 2016.""In short courses on effective communication presented for industry in Great Britain and Europe by UWIST, Cardiff, the emphasis is on practical work, with extensive group discussion of each participant's attempts at various communication tasks.""The scope, scale, and substance of business communication are undergoing a sea change as the result of recent developments and emerging uses of communication technologies.

However, these tools are not equally effective in helping job candidates showcase specific skills during the hiring process. In a survey, we asked recruiters about the skills they seek in applicants and the best method for students to demonstrate those skills. The top five skills sought, not unexpectedly, are 1: communication (oral and written); 2. computer literacy; 3. interpersonal/social; 4. critical thinking/leadership (tied); and 5. teamwork. Recruiters still favored the resume and interview as methods for demonstrating these skills, but they also felt a portfolio was useful in providing evidence of these skills in context. None recommended video presentation. Based on this study, we suggest that instructors provide students with explicit instruction on developing resumes and portfolios and in performing well in interviews. © 2002, Sage Publications.

This study examines IPO prospectuses of 57 biotechnology firms listed on the NASDAQ between 1997 and 2002. Using regression analysis, this article shows that the clarity, intensity, and consistency of the corporate strategy signal are not strong enough to affect the 1st-day initial returns. However, consistent communication of a prospector strategy negatively impacts 30-day initial returns, whereas consistent communication of a defender strategy positively impacts 30-day initial returns. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""The purpose of this study was to learn about readers' ability to logically comprehend sequential procedural instructions, presented as isolated graphic frames. Further, this study sought to find out how text and graphical aids can help comprehension. The 20 participants in this study received a stack of graphic cutouts demonstrating the action in a sequential assembly process. Readers had to sequentially order the collection of unordered graphics with either supporting text describing the action or supporting graphics showing the completed action. Results showed that readers often falter when process information is not presented as part of a configuration and also falter often at points where they need to comprehend instructions demonstrating transitions between subassemblies. Further, data also showed that performance was better with outcome graphics as an aid than with text as an aid, although the difference was not statistically significant. © 2007 IEEE.""An experimental program was designed to test the effect of using various sources of index terms on retrieval effectiveness and costs. The purpose of the experimental program was to provide quantitative data for making a management decision on indexing procedures for an information storage and retrieval system. The tradeoff between input cost and retrieval effectiveness was the primary factor in the decision. The experiment was designed to provide the needed data. The full technical document text was divided into five categories: title,; abstract; table of contents and lists of figures and tabels; author-assigned keywords; and the body. An experimental data base of technical documents was created. Manual indexing using thesaurus-controlled keywords was performed. The index term source by category and the time required for indexing by category were recorded. It was concluded that excluding the body of the document reduced indexing time (and therefore input cost) significantly with relatively little degradation in retrieval effectiveness. The optimum retrieval effectiveness/cost ratio was achieved using titles, abstracts, and table of content and lists of figures and tables. Author keywords alone proved entirely inadequate. Since many information retrieval systems, both those based on text-derived automatic indexing and those based on manual indexing depend entirely on titles, abstracts or less than full document texts for indexing and retrieval, the importance of these document elements cannot be overemphasized. The implications of this experiment are that technical writers and editors must consider eventual inclusion of their work in a retrieval system. With this consideration, more effective titles, abstracts and tables contents will result.""Although many technical communication teachers and programs integrate some form of service-learning pedagogy, there is a dearth of technical communication research on the silent partners of these projects: the community partners. Drawing upon research data from 14 former community partners of professional writing service-learning courses, the authors suggest that understanding community partners own self-defined stakes in service-learning projects can challenge hyperpragmatist representations of community partners and aid us in the continued creation, management, and critical evaluation of service-learning pedagogies and curricula. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Simplicity, as an ideal in the design of visual representations, has not received systematic attention. High-level guidelines are too general, and low-level guidelines too ad hoc, too numerous, and too often incompatible, to serve in a particular design situation. This paper reviews notions of visual simplicity in the literature within the analytical framework provided by Charles Morris' communication model, specifically, his trichotomy of communication levels—the syntactic, the semantic, and the pragmatic. Simplicity is ultimate ly shown to entail the adjudication of incompatibilities both within, and between, levels. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Each student gives a ten-minute oral presentation, followed by a five-minute question-and-answer period. Presentations are grouped in panels of five papers; each panel is moderated by a session chairperson. Students receive copies of the schedule and presentation abstracts prior to the opening sessions. Presentations are evaluated by the students and the instructor for technical content, visuals, and delivery using a standardized evaluation checklist. Students learn to analyze and speak to a heterogeneous audience; to distinguish the strengths and weaknesses of presentations and visuals; and to convey assessments to others in a professional manner.""The article discusses ways to motivate students in business writing classes, and comments on the lack of respect that exists regarding the teaching of business writing.

Method: Cross-sectional sample survey of 1,000 STC members conducted in May 2008; multiple survey contacts by email with link to online survey instrument. Results: Of 276 respondents, half reported using SS/CM methods and tools. About 1 in 10 respondents reported experience with a failed implementation of SS/CM; half the SS/CM users reported significant downsides or tradeoffs. Perceived top drivers of SS/CM adoption were faster development, lower costs, regulatory and compliance pressures, and translation needs. About 1 in 9 respondents used Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). Large company size made use of SS/CM significantly more likely, and work groups using single sourcing with content management were significantly larger than work groups of other SS/CM subgroups and non-users of SS/CM. Single sourcing without content management seems destined to achieve a larger proportion of adopters than single sourcing with content management, barring a technology breakthrough. Among all respondents, Microsoft Word and FrameMaker were the most-used primary authoring tools. Conclusions: With regard to these methods and tools, STC members appear to be in the Early Majority phase of Everett M. Rogers's innovation adoption curve. Diffusion of these methods and tools appeared to have been steady in the five years prior to the survey, with no dramatic increase in more recent pace of adoption."Considers how most technical writing uses a craftsman model and evaluates the applicability of that model to single sourcing Proposes a technical communication career path with distinct job responsibilities for junior and senior writersCautions that failing to focus on the people in the organization may diminish the success of a single-sourcing initiative Covers changes that need to occur in the organization to support a single-sourcing initiative and ways to address issues of change"Because corporations today face fierce international competition, they must produce and maintain high-quality documentation-but at minimal cost. Optimizing a writer's time and effort will no doubt become a key study area as we try to do more with less, without sacrificing quality. One way to increase a technical writer's productivity is to design documentation so that it covers a broader product area. This approach gets more use (or reuse) of the text.

It is claimed that these techniques of teaching technical writing will help the student: 1. To improve and to refine the style of technical writing. 2. To learn how to analyze an audience intelligently. 3. To be encouraged to read scientific literature and to criticize the various styles of scientific writing. 4. To become acquainted with the large variety of scientific/technical journals. 5. To learn the resources of the library. 6. To read technical/scientific magazines analytically. 7. To write reports professionally. 8. To be motivated to write articles for possible publication in scientific/technical magnazines. 9. To write science books for children. 10.

Students typically are told to employ topic sentences and transitional expressions without being told why these devices are crucial to effective communications. To understand fully the importance of paragraph cohesion, technical writing students require both a theoretical framework and a common-sense methodology for the construction of coherent paragraphs. By employing principles from information theory and structural linguistics, this essay offers a teaching strategy that attempts to help the student understand the importance of paragraph cohesion while at the same time offering suggestions for the construction of coherent paragraphs.""This study traces Renaissance and post-Renaissance technical writers' use of classical rhetoric in English instruction manuals on the sport of falconry. A study of the period's five prominent falconry manuals written by four authors - George Turberville, Simon Latham, Edmund Bert, and Richard Blome - reveals these technical writers' conscious use of classical rhetoric as an important technique to persuade readers to accept these authors' authority and trust the information they were disseminating. These manuals employed several classical rhetorical techniques: invention by using ethos and several classical topics, classical arrangement, the plain style, and adaptation of the orator's duties. The explanation for this classical influence rests in the authors' own knowledge of classical rhetoric derived from sources such as Thomas Wilson, as well as the sources from whom these authors obtained their knowledge of falconry. The article ends by suggesting the origins through which these classical rhetorical techniques influenced the writing of the manuals. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Based on the results of a 2004 self-study and review by the Northwest Accreditation Commission, the Professional and Technical Writing (P&TW) faculty at Weber State University decided to implement a full program assessment.

P&TW faculty also consulted relevant literature, focused on a theoretical approach, developed outcomes for each course, and created a holistic rubric to evaluate student portfolios in the program’s capstone course. In fall 2007, faculty will begin using the outcomes and rubric in order to determine whether or not student outcomes meet course objectives, to monitor course description changes and additions, to standardize and improve faculty approaches to grading and teaching, and to track students’ work with various clients. After five years, faculty will report preliminary results of their program review.""Regardless of their oral communication ability, students must be willing to use their communication skills to be successful in business professions.

Until recently, the concept of small talk has been largely ignored or denigrated. However, recent studies indicate that small talk may play a key role in building relations and trust between staff in companies, which is of key importance in effective and productive business. Based on an empirical study, the article argues that small talk may be of particular value to speakers of business English as a lingua franca (BELF) in allowing them to develop solidarity, despite linguistic and cultural differences, and thus increase the likelihood of avoiding or successfully overcoming communication problems. In addition, insights into the nature of such small talk may be of value in raising awareness of aspects of effective communication in international business and the notion of international communicative competence. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""The author discusses the results of a mail survey of 42 software-manual writers, editors, and their managers residing in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. The survey analyzed the concept of task orientation in computer manuals. Analysis of the survey led to the following conclusions: software-manual writers, editors, and their managers overwhelmingly think task orientation is the best way to organize manuals. The type of manual you write (system or application) or the size of computer you write for does not influence the effectiveness of task orientation. When a writer organizes a manual by tasks, he or she most often uses an organizational strategy where each major tasks is described in a chapter. Finally, respondents described problems encountered when writing task-oriented manuals, and techniques used to write effective task-oriented manuals.""Presents information about China that the authors have gained as teachers, consultants, and travelers.

A survey was conducted in 1992 in the headquarters of a large, geographically dispersed telecommunications company in Maryland which used an in-house electronic mail system. The findings showed that electronic messages were not widely used for socioemotional purposes but were certainly more common among certain groups. Messages pertaining to socioemotional content were generally avoided in downward and diagonal communication. Younger employees who had worked for the organization for a shorter period of time and were holding lower level jobs were more likely to communicate socioemotional content via electronic messages. These people were less often involved in the decision-making process and felt they did not make effective decisions. However, socioemotional use was positively related to perceived quality of work. Consistent with previous studies, upper managers tended to use electronic messages for routine tasks. When time pressure was involved, electronic messages would be used for complex tasks. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""″Scientific communication″ is defined as the public display, by an individual scientist or small group of scientists to other scientists, of the results of recent research accomplished by the individual or small group, by means of papers published in scientific journals, delivered at conferences, or informally distributed among members of invisible colleges. A ″social function″ of scientific communication is defined as an effect of scientific communication on a scientific discipline or on one or more of its members. It is argued that the social functions of scientific communication grow out of three fundamental characteristics of science as a social enterprise: (1) science is a professional occupation; (2) science is a value-directed norm-governed social activity; and (3) science is a system of social exchange. The characteristics of scientific papers are examined in light of their social functions. It is suggested that these functions may be classified in three categories: (1) surveillance functions; (2) socialization functions; and (3) social control functions.""Facebook (FB) is a popular communication medium and community building tool for health outreach, promotion, and support groups for patients with chronic and rare conditions. Medical writers and health communication specialists are often tasked to write the content and support community interactions in health-related FB interventions. However, studies have reported mixed results at sustaining patient participation and engagement in FB interventions. Questions remain about the relationship between health behavior and FB usage and best strategies for evaluating health-related FB interventions. Furthermore, few studies examine health-related FB usage of people not designated as patients, which might help identify native activities that can sustain participants' interest in and engagement with FB interventions. This study examines offline and online health-related activities of FB to identify characteristics shared by people who use FB for health-related purposes. The data from 455 users indicate that offline social health activities do not transfer online; privacy issues, interaction preferences, and differences between FB and offline networks may be barriers. FB campaigns and interventions should have modest and focused goals, such as supplementing offline activities and increasing preexisting FB activity. Designing FB interventions for networks and social groups with preexisting emotional ties and trust would be ideal. © The Author(s) 2016.""The study attempts to study how an empowered Chinese public coped with and interpreted the environmental crisis of the ConocoPhillips oil spill and how ConocoPhillips reacted to the growing influence of social media. Research questions: In what ways did the Chinese public exercise its new power through social media in addressing the ConocoPhillips Oil Spill Incident? How did a multinational company like ConocoPhillips act during the crisis and react to the voices of the public through new media? Literature review: Social media has caused a power shift in China by allowing the ordinary Chinese public who used to be the silent majority to expose scandals and express their opinions about crises with greater freedom. At the same time, pressure is growing on corporations to exercise social responsibility, through responding to economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary expectations that society has. Stakeholder theory indicates that only by meeting the needs and expectations of the individuals and groups who can affect or are affected by the firm's objectives can a firm survive and succeed. In developing countries, corporate social responsibility is characterized by a lack of systematic and institutionalized approach, with stakeholders, such as the public and community, being neglected for a long time. Methodology: Researchers conducted a thematic analysis of 932 microblog and blog entries about the ConocoPhillips Oil Spill Incident in China that were published on leading Chinese social media websites between June 2011 to February 2013. Results and discussion: The study found that the oil spill sparked an uproar of anger and criticism in the Chinese online community. Most posts on microblogs and blogs engaged in finding the causes and laying the blame for the oil spill. The overwhelming majority of the Chinese public attributed the crisis to the faulty laws and inaction on the part of the Chinese government regulators, to ConocoPhillips, and the Chinese joint venture partner China National Offshore Oil Corporation's failure to undertake due responsibilities. In response to mounting online criticisms, ConocoPhillips exhibited little interest in engaging with the Chinese public and showed poor communication in terms of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The study's theoretical contribution lies in combining CSR and Stakeholder theory with Discourse Power theory. Practical implications to multinational corporations seeking long-term business development in the developing country contexts, such as China, are that managers need to engage in responsive listening, actively participate in online conversations, and constantly scan the social media environment to manage its relations with the general public. Particularly, firms experiencing crises can gain the public's emotional support by communicating emotion-laden messages through social media. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Students raised with pervasive technology are believed to have developed skills and ways of thinking that require new approaches to education.

Unlike a traditional payphone in public, cellphones do not have privacy booths. Therefore, the ways in which people respond to cellphone calls in public spaces provide markers for social topographical space. In this study I explore how cellphone users negotiate privacy when using cellphones in public space and how those within the proximity of the caller negotiate space in response to these callers. Based on a year-long study involving observation fieldwork and in-depth interviews, I discuss the flexibility with which people constantly negotiate their private and public sense of self when using and responding to cellphones in public spaces. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Specifications of the hardware, the logic and assumptions of the software, and examples of the input language are provided for a typesetting system used for mathematics copy.""The field of software documentation is reviewed by examining manual writing before and after 1985.

The initial goals were to give the students the opportunity to learn about the practical aspects of cooperation between two geographically separate institutions and to study specific problems anticipated by the teachers with regard to communication, coordination, language, culture, requirements' handling, testing, and bug fixing. This report focuses on communication and coordination within the cooperative project as these were identified as the most significant problem areas. We also thought that these areas were the most interesting and the ones most likely to lead to improvements. This report not only describes our findings but also gives hints about what to think about when running similar projects both with respect to project-related issues and teaching issues.""Utility of problem solving exercises for software learners was analyzed. Problem solving exercise with a well defined goal and on-your-own exercise to explore options independently were the two types of exercises provided to learners of a spreadsheet program. It is expected that learners with ill-defined goal would gain more from problem solving exercise, while leraners with a well defined goal would profit more from on-your-own exercises. The results confirms the hypothesis which can be explained as a consequence of differences in the mental models of the learners.""The article discusses various issues of communication in business. The author feels that the term communication has eclipsed composition in titles of courses and textbooks. The term communication applies not only to writing, but to all forms of speech, both verbal and nonverbal. The use of liberal arts in higher education is discussed, noting that aspects of liberal arts education are found in most curricula. The author criticizes the state of technical writing education for not emphasizing fundamental writing skills.""In this article, the author uses the critical vocabulary developed by Bruno Latour in his recent work Politics of Nature to offer an alternative way for technical and professional communicators to approach and articulate their work. Using the Discovery Channel's Mythbusters to explore Latour's vocabulary, the author argues that positioning technical and professional communication as more than transmitting and translating, but instead as the collecting of articulated propositions about the common world in service of the common good, thoroughly grounds its practice in rhetorical theory. Such a positioning also ascribes value to technical and professional communication without reinscribing the false dichotomy between science and politics.""This article reports Social Sciences Citation Index® citations of six periodicals, three that cover business communication explicitly and three that address related areas. The results indicate that business communication articles are cited by many different journals - primarily in the areas of written communication, social sciences and education, and business and economics - but are not cited frequently. The results also indicate that business communication periodicals compare favorably on several indexes of impact with 10 communication journals studied by Clement So. Some differences are noted between the six journals, and the most-cited business communication articles are identified. © 1996 Sage Publications, Inc.""This article is placed with the defined area of study of ″coherence,″ which is seen as one of the three parts of recent work in the ″discourse analysis″ of contemporary English prose with emphasis on technical writing. One element of the total system of coherence is seen to be the ″associated nominal″ which, together with repetition, substitution, deletion, synonymy, among others, enables writers to maintain the thread of continuity in a text. Introductory details of associated nominals are given, and some of their purposes and environments of use are described with the use of examples of actual English use. Potential effects of this work on the teaching of technical writing are mentioned, and detailed references and an annotated bibliography assist readers who may wish to read further. The references are followed by brief comments by the present author on 8 of the more recent references. 23 refs.""This study was designed to assess the effects of delay in publication of information in medical journals. The case study concerned the natural history of an article that appeared recently in a medical journal. The particulars of this article from the time of its conception through its consecutive submission to, and rejection by, four major medical journals, and its eventual publication, instead, in a minor medical journal have been studied. The subject of the article was a new form of treatment for Amanita verna poisoning. The period of delay between clinical treatment and publication of the article was 21 months. During this period, however, information about this clinical case received general publicity through newspapers, magazine articles, radio, and telephone. These details then were considered in the context of the medical journal's traditional role: to communicate information that sometimes may be urgent. The effects of delays and breakdowns in the information system that links medical authors with medical readers by way of medical journals and the influence of other media on medical communication also have been considered. To remain effective as channels of communication in an information-conscious society, medical journals must reassess their traditional methods of transmitting information by becoming aware of faults in this specialized communication system and by ensuring that information that is primarily of medical interest does not, by default, have to be transmitted by other channels.""An experiment was carried out to investigate whether it is useful to add system information to procedural information in instructional text. It was assumed that readers of instructions construct both a procedural and a system mental model, and that the latter enables the readers to infer possible missing information in procedural instructions. Moreover, it was assumed that system information would increase the cognitive load during reading and practicing, and that it would affect the appreciation of the instructions as well as the self-efficacy of the reader. The participants in the experiment read instructions and practiced with a fictitious machine before performing a number of tasks and answering a questionnaire. The results indicate that system information increased the cognitive load during reading and decreased self-efficacy, while the instructional text with system information was judged as more difficult. The effect on performance is limited: system information leads to faster performance for correctly completed tasks.""Writing for publication in the professional literature brings prestige to the author and recognition to his employer. Yet in many organizations, few technical articles are written for publication in the professional literature. This paper discusses some of the elements involved with writing technical papers for publication within a technical corporate environment. It outlines some of the major incentives and barriers to publishing and offers suggestions for addressing the barriers from both the author's viewpoint and that of management. Those elements composed the foundation of a workshop designed to encourage technical professionals to write for publication. The workshop included exposition of the reasons to publish, addressed barriers to publication, discussed skill building, and contained company-specific briefings on internal release procedures and management support for writing. © 1989 IEEE""Letter writing, known as dictamen in the Medieval and Renaissance periods, was formatively dependent upon the theory of oral rhetoric of the ancient world, some reflections of which are still apparent today. Three oral rhetoric precepts were applied by letter writers: inventio, locating material for three kinds of letters; dispositio, organizing letters into an introduction, body, and conclusion; and style, applying ornateness along with clarity and correctness to prose. Representative English, Italian, and German letter writing practi tioners carried the oral tradition along. © 1988, Sage Publications.

The instructional system, as defined in this paper, is a collection of people and things that has the purpose of changing the capabilities of a group of students through learning. It is designed to insure that changes in student capabilities take place. Four general methods for developing an instructional system are explained and so is the importance of role playing in developing an instructional paradigm for organizational communication. © 1977, Sage Publications.

He must be particularly aware of the conditions under which they will be reading what he writes. His tasks are then to articulate the problem (and explain why it is a problem), then, drawing on his knowledge of the readers, to motivate them to carry out the specific solution that he proposes. This game plan, effective as it may sound, is not likely to succeed, however, unless the writer adopts the proper tone. His attitude, whether approval or disapproval, contempt or respect, must be appropriate to the topic, to the audience, and to the writer-audience relationship.""A reprint of the article, originally published as ""Reconciling Theory and Practice in Business Writing,"" published in the May, 1948 issue of the periodical, is presented. The article discusses the theory and practice of teaching business writing. Although the general principles of business writing and other kinds of writing are the same, it must be adapted to the situation."This article examines the psychological aspects of business letter writing. The growth of the business letter as an item of major financial and operating importance is significant among all industrial and business developments. Most business correspondence textbooks devote large amounts of space to business letters. Several steps to a sale which salesmen should follow are listed. The basic differences between sales letters and advertisements are listed. The author notes that several factors affect the writing of collection letters and adjustment letters. Formal announcements of the status of delinquent accounts and histories of previous collection efforts do not qualify as attention-compelling devices. A pilot study suggests hat some aspects of 'good' writing in fact inhibit comprehension and that some awkward styles tend to enhance retention. This kind of research could have strong effects on both the practice and the teaching of technical writing."Many teachers of technical writing are guilty of blindly following tradiation and convention in teaching students to rely on the outline as an organizing device, in categorically condemning the passive voice, in magnifying the importance of form and format, and in insisting on a set of inflexible rules for grammar and style that ignore widespread usage. Implicit in the attack on shibboleths is a plea for honest pragmatism in determining effectiveness in technical writing.""Special Dictionaries of terms in electronics and computers/data processing can be very helpful to the writer or editor, even though they are expensive and their lack of conventional dictionary features may be frustrating.

One discovers that the distinction between dynamic and stative uses of verbs is crucial for understanding the various functions of passive sentences and nominalizations in business and technical writing. Then the functions of passive sentences and nominalizations are enumerated and illustrated with sentences from business and technical texts before discussing the various devices for expressing agency in passive and nominalized sentences. Only by understanding the various functions of these sentence types can instructors of business and technical writing offer specific and practical advice."This article looks at several theoretical approaches to the teaching of business communication. Problems and confusion resulting from attempts to define communication are discussed. The author notes that most people assume that communicationbehavior is conscious or willed. The objectives of business communication training are to facilitate the behavioral objectives of communicating by improving and increasing the behavioral tools of the communicator. Basic differences between the structural and functional approaches to business communication are discussed."Making sense is the hallmark of purposeful writing, yet too few people take the time necessary to revise what they have written. No one should be satisfied with a first draft. Writing is a process and, as such, requires taking whatever time is necessary to produce worthwhile writing. Included are seven tips to consider in the revision process: (1) keep subjects, verbs, objects, and complements close together; (2) maintain an average sentence length of less than 20 words; (3) prefer the active voice; (4) eliminate the indefinite ″this″ ; (5) simplify verb tenses; (6) ensure that all paragraphs have clear topic sentences; and (7) avoid ″this is″ and ″there are″ constructions. Some helpful textbooks are listed.""Standardized news selection, rigidly patterned reporting, and an outdated conception of the nature of the scientific enterprise have produced a misleading picture of science in the mass media. Thoughtful, interpretive reporting based on a broad understanding of the history, philosoohy, and sociology of science could vastly improve public understanding.""A study of the oral communication experiences and training of obstetric sonographers can provide insight into the complex expectations these medical professionals face as they complete their technical tasks and communicate with patients. Unlike other diagnostic medical professionals, obstetric sonographers are expected to provide detailed information to patients during the exam, a practice not typically found in the work of other types of medical diagnostic professionals. This study presents the results of interviews with 23 obstetric sonographers who described their communication experiences and their views on sonographer training in communication. Results suggest that sonographers experience complex communication challenges in the workplace that are not typically addressed in their education, nor are they officially recognized in the official discourse of their profession. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Drawing on arguments by Carolyn Miller, Steven Katz, and others, this essay claims that teaching ethics is particularly important to technical writing. Next, the essay outlines a classical, sophistic approach to ethics based on the theories and pedagogies of Protagoras, Gorgias, and lsocrates. This sophistic approach emphasizes the Greek concept of nomos, internal and external deliberation, and responsible action or articulation. The final section of the essay discusses possible problems and pedagogical applications of sophistic ethics in the contemporary technical writing classroom. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The son of an unlettered country innkeeper, Cola combined a passion for classical rhetoric and literature with extensive training in legal documentation to create and sustain a messianic regime. By imitating Ancient Roman memos and reports in his written edicts, Cola convinced the people that he was their tribune and savior. The aristocrats and clerics chafing under Cola's authority, however, considered these documents sortilegio, sheer witchcraft. When Rienzi's edicts became increasingly selfserving and grandiloquent, the mob, sickened by his megalomania, tore him to pieces. Although he was posthumously declared anathema by the Church - partly for having invented the fountain pen - Cola's legislative reforms, and his revolutionary use of the classics to reshape administrative writing, helped pave the way for Renaissance Humanism.""This article describes the background of the creation of SOVAM TELEPORT, analyzes the problems it has faced and how it has attempted to solve them, describes the organization's customers and services, and speculates on the synergistic relationship between Russian society and its telecommunications industry. © 1994 IEEE.""This paper was delivered as the keynote address of the American Business Writing As sociation's Thirty-First Annual Convention, New Orleans, De cember 28, 1966.

However, even when men and women are objectively equal on these dimensions, receivers perceive men as being more persuasive as speakers than women. In addition, these two dimensions do not account for other measures of credibility which affect persuasive business communication. This paper expands the model to in clude dimensions which explain gender differences in speaker credibility in persuasive business communication with support from the gender literature. Research proposi tions are suggested, and implications of this research are discussed. © 1989, Sage Publications.

The aim of the study is to provide a better understanding of instructional video patterns and typologies and to find associations between video style usage and course attributes such as the MOOC platform and course subjects. Method: Five global, generalist MOOC platforms were selected for this study, which was conducted in two phases: First, a qualitative survey was made to identify frequently used video styles and build a classification scheme. Second, a sample of 115 courses in the selected MOOC platforms was used to account for video features and style frequencies. Various statistical tests were performed to discover associations between course characteristics and video style usage. Results: Seven video styles were identified as the most frequent in MOOC courses. They fully describe the video stock of 85% of the sampled courses. A typical course uses two different styles. The study reveals two broad competing approaches to display instructional contents in MOOC videos: speaker-centric (a visible person speaks the contents) and board-centric (a large rectangular surface displays the contents). The actual usage of each approach is significantly related to the course subject area: Arts and humanities courses exhibit a preference for speaker-centric styles, while engineering and hard science courses favor board-centric videos. Social sciences and health courses are more neutral. Conclusion: Current MOOCs are focused on few representational styles, with speakers and boards as the two main models. The observed usage is consistent with a strong attachment to the lecture as an instructional technique. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

The article analyzes why current communications courses have failed to address the oral skills improvement needs of the technical student, identifies the special advantages of the technical classroom as a forum for improving speaking skills, outlines some considerations for designing and evaluating speaking exercises, and anticipates some of the concerns which might occur to the technical educator considering such a program. © 1988 IEEE""Within a theoretical context of speech accomodation theory, this study follows Lambert et al.'s (1960) ""matched-guise"" technique. Seventy-two African-American students at a mid-south university listened to and evaluated a tape-recorded excerpt of a speech given by Jesse Jackson at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. The first version of the speech was translated into Ebonics. After students listened to the first four-minute speech in Ebonics, students then proceeded to answer a questionnaire concerning the ethos/source credibility and perceived sociability of the speaker. Next, students listened to the same audiotaped speech (given by the same speaker), except the text of the speech was translated (and subsequently delivered) in Standard English. The students then rated this second speaker on those same ethos/source credibility and sociability scales. The speaker who used Standard English was viewed as more credible (i.e., more competent and having a strong character) and sociable than the Ebonics speaker. Both of these scores were significant at the p≤.05 level. Future research replicating these results is urged across other African-American samples."Communicators have special opportunities to promote environmental ethics.

We examine the language employed in practitioner-oriented texts and consultant websites on diversity. We first illustrate the characteristics of the managerial metaphor, including the emphasis on achieving competitive advantage and a ""quick-fix"" orientation toward improving managerial competencies regarding diversity. We then analyze the implications of the managerial metaphor in terms of (a) whose interests are emphasized by the metaphor, (b) whose interests are (potentially) marginalized by the metaphor, (c) how the metaphor system relates to power and economic interests, (d) how different metaphors present alternative positions, and (e) implications for business communication. We contend that language that constitutes individuals as resources emphasizes managerial and economic interests and potentially marginalizes human and ethical aspects of diversity. © 2002 by the Association for Business Communication.""The article focuses on factors relating to effective communication. Speaking and writing relationships help and hinder effective communication. Due to these factors business communicationstudents must be aware of differences between business speaking and business writing. Alternately, research must focus on the need to understand speaking and writing relationships in business communication. Previous research on speaking and writing relationships has revealed textual differences on the syntactic, lexical, and conventional levels.""The R&D manager is responsible for the management of the technical information flow into and within his organization. Complicating his management task is the fact that a large amount of such information flows in informal, unplanned networks. Playing key roles in these inormal information networks are a few special communicators who act as information focal points, who seem to have special access to information sources, and who are involved in a relatively large number of information transactions. It may be possible for the R&D manager to influence informal networks in a positive way be identifying special communicators, by further enhancing their exposure to information, and by giving them special consideration in the allocation of information-related resources.""This article introduces a special issue assessing the attitudes, ideas, and practices of technical communication managers representing several prominent companies on the Society for Technical Communication’s Advisory Council in 2013–2014. Method: The research team used a modified Delphi method to assess the opinions of this group of experts over several rounds. This article describes and justifies the methodological approach of the entire study. Results: The results are described in three individual articles following this introduction in the special issue, taking up the topics respectively of Identities and Relationships, Products and Processes, and Training and Education. Conclusion: Technical communication should pay more attention to the perspective of publications managers. © 2015, Technical Communication.

He states that there is a need to balance the need to be published and gain recognition with the goals and purposes of ABCA publications. He comments about the need to talk about the demands brought about by changing technology. He mentions that writers need to understand what the jargon they use in their articles means. He suggests that writers need to be careful to understand the balance between individual interests, professional needs, and what writers can offer in their writing.""Electronic media has become a common way of acquiring knowledge and of communicating within and among corporate organizations. It offers the major advantage of easy transmission of information anytime and anywhere. This new communication tool, however, also presents disadvantages as the impact of a global 24-hour workdays has intense implications on people's lives. It also fosters a struggle for dominance because the system can provide shared knowledge among all the constituents of an organization which, in turn, would be a threat to the management's privilege to keep company secrets.""Adding appropriate visual aids to technical verbalizations typically increases the listeners' retention severalfold. In preparing visual aids, highlight just the key information, show relationships, avoid clutter, and aim for ″artist's rough″ rather than art quality. Characteristics of several ways of presenting data visually are discussed. For effective meetings, presenters should also provide background and orientation to give participants a common starting point and then should not present more information than the particular audience needs to know.""At various times since the first issue of the American Journal of Physiology was published in 1898, the American Physiological Society has responded to developments in physiology by starting new journals, buying an existing journal, and establishing sections within journals. Now, specialization within physiology demands further modification to clearly defined specialty journals. The pressures that caused this action to be taken are described, as well as the options considered and the implementation of the final plan. The publications program being developed is one that should serve the specialists within the field without penalizing generalists or librarians.""The problem of specialization in news reporting is enormously complex and often confusing, with arguments centering around how much expertise the specialized reporter should have and how he should acquire it. In perhaps no other area is the complexity and confusion greater or more perplexing than in science writing. Strengths and weaknesses of specialized training for science writing were explored in a mail survey of 152 newspaper, magazine, and free lance science writers in the United States and Canada. Advantages and disadvantages of specialized training were identified through analysis of comments which many science writers made on the questionnaires they returned. Some recommendations for potential science writers are presented.""This paper analyzes the PowerPoint handouts of 22 engineering undergraduate students to establish criteria for judging the persuasive capabilities of the students' visual argument in handouts that are expanded versions of PowerPoint slides used for presentations. Specific guidelines on how to create effective visual arguments that are useful as slides meant for presentations cannot be used as handouts. Method: The criteria were derived primarily from Doumont's (2002) three laws of professional communication that suggest how to combine rhetorical and visual elements to form coherent arguments. Results: The results show that Doumont's laws are helpful in judging the persuasiveness of the students' visual arguments. In addition, the weaknesses in the students' visual arguments applied to all three laws, which is in line with Doumont's view that the laws have an order of precedence. Conclusion: The guidelines in this paper can help practitioners convert their slides into handouts more effectively and encourage teachers to spend more time teaching visual argument in the classroom.""International research findings and anecdotal evidence alike suggest that new accountancy graduates often begin their careers with inadequate oral communication skills. However, there is a lack of well-grounded empirical data concerning precisely what accountancy employers mean by ""oral communication"" and what specific skills they value most highly. This article describes a research project investigating the importance of 27 oral communication skills for students intending to begin an accountancy career in New Zealand, as perceived by chartered accountancy professionals. It also examines how frequently accountancy employers are finding these desired skills in new graduates. The findings reported in this study offer important guidance concerning the oral communication skills that new graduates will find most useful in the New Zealand accountancy workplace and suggest useful directions for accountancy students internationally. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article introduces Speculative Usability. Whereas traditional models of usability rely on the salient features of an object-user relationship focused around the uses for which the object was designed, the goal of Speculative Usability is to notice an object as it interacts with other objects (in addition to but including human users) and to be vulnerable to an object's unintended effects. The payoff of this speculative approach is an increased inventional capacity for usability testing. © The Author(s) 2015""This article applies speech act theory to business communication principles in order to determine why certain messages succeed while others fail. Specifically, it shows how H. P. Grice's maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner illuminate the writing process in business communication. It also discusses the pros and cons of conventional versus nonconventional business writing strategies. It suggests that speech act theory provides both a theoretical framework for discussing business communications and a practical means of analyzing individual messages. © 1983, Sage Publications.

This bibliography cites 178 resources for technical communicators interested in improving their speaking skills. These resources include organizations and publications concerned with speech; institutes, seminars, and courses on oral communication of technical information; and standard works and selected articles on informational speech. This bibliography is not complete but it is a start for technical communicators in business, industry, and government who are intent on improving their oral presentation of technical information. Many of the sources also discuss technical writing.""A five-year interdisciplinary effort by speech scientists and computer scientists has demonstrated the feasibility of programming a computer system to ″understand″ connected speech, i. e. , translate it into operational form and respond accordingly.

The statistical result was that speaking tasks were rated slightly higher than writing tasks for all engineering fields surveyed, independent of whether the respondent spent more time in engineering or in management. Also, more than 50 percent had job-related spoken communication with technical personnel at least daily and with nontechnical personnel at least weekly.""Spelling skills of 439 college business students were assessed using a conventional spelling test comprised of 25 business-related words and 25 other commonly used words. As a group, business students scored higher than previously established high school norms, although a substantial number of business students demonstrated spelling skills below the ninth grade level. Students with high college grade-point averages, who ranked high in their high school graduating class, who are female, and who currently work only a few hours outside the home tended to be better spellers. Recommendations are offered to business educators concerned about their students'spelling skills. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Yet instructors of professional communication genres have discovered that students' motivation may be enhanced when they write assignments for audiences of peers within the classroom or professionals outside the campus. Yet client-based projects require writing students who have never yet written for an external audience to make a leap beyond the classroom. To bridge the gap between writing for classroom peers and writing for professional clients, this article describes a third and intermediate choice of audience, namely, external peers in cross-classroom collaborations that occur via telecommunication. The author places this intermediate-audience strategy within the larger conversation about the impact of audience on student writing outcomes, applies the strategy to professional writing pedagogy, and reports the results of a small pilot study that provide some preliminary support for the strategy. © 2009 Sage Publications.""Experiments were performed on the propagation and stability of voidage fronts produced by a sudden change in operating conditions. Linear instability theory, assuming the fluidized mixture to behave as an effective Newtonian fluid, predicts a high degree of instability, in disagreement with experiment.""Drawing on insights from Goffman's dramaturgical approach to interaction, this article demonstrates how meetings are team performances routinely concerned with sustaining or challenging interpretations of power relations. The data for this article were collected at a British embassy, relying on participant observation, audio recordings of weekly gatherings of Heads of Section, and interviews with the people that attended the meeting. The analysis focuses on the double role behavior of the Ambassador as the director and central player of a team performance and the conflicting ideologies these shifting roles entail.""Technical communication increasingly occurs in distributed, cross-cultural, and cross-organizational environments in which stakeholders may have widely disparate-even conflicting-perspectives. Information and communication technology for development (ICTD) is one such environment. Balancing complex and conflicting perspectives of multiple stakeholder groups is a challenge, and unstable stakeholder participation is a widespread problem in ICTD projects. The study presented here shows that stakeholders' participation in a project was sustained most easily when the value that the stakeholders would gain from such participation was congruent with their respective national and organizational cultures. This study has implications for technical communicators working on cross-organizational projects, particularly projects that occur in distributed, cross-cultural environments. © The Author(s) 2013.""Standardization in typography, spelling, abbreviations, and citations provides a semblance of uniformity to a journal. Standardization guarantees greater flexibility in the use of copyeditors in an office that publishes several journals. However, journals in different disciplines lend themselves to different formats and styles: a large journal with many articles is more efficiently set in double-column pages of small type, while a journal containing many equations requires a single-column page with generous size type and citation of references in the text by author and date instead of by number. Such deviations from routine standardization keep copyeditors alert. Perhaps the most important area of standardization in a redactory office is in the procedures of checking galley and page proof.""The authors describe two of the organizations involved in standards development in the U. S. : the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). They discuss the mechanism for standards development, the life cycle of a standard, and the revision of American National Standard Z39. 18-1974, Guidelines for Format and Production of Scientific and Technical Reports.""Business and industry spend a great deal of time and money in standardizing office and shop methods, all to promote efficient operations. Yet they give little - if any - thought to one pervasive operation that wastes an unfathomable amount of time and money: written communication. They allow almost any writing approach, as long as something is written, because they believe that to know how to write an English essay is to know how to communicate on the job. Nothing is further from the truth. Writing in business and industry requires a particular philosophy as well as special writing mechanics that, when combined and standardized, promote efficient communication. This article advances such a philosophy - and some basic writing mechanics - for that standardization.""This article reports the findings from analysis of end-of-life court cases and case files from one state public guardianship administrator as well as interviews with guardians or surrogates to identify how language and principles of the courts are operationalized in end-of-life decisions for those who are unable to make decisions for themselves.

Central to this study is a shift from activity to mobility systems. Building on technical communication scholarship, the frame integrates actor networks and activity theory knotworks. Disrupting workplace and national container models (methodological nationalism), the analysis is grounded in a study of Israeli start-up entrepreneurs. Dubbed the Start-Up Nation, Israel contains more start-ups per capita than any other country in the world, with its high-tech industry made up of a dense ecosystem of conferences, accelerators, meetups, social media, and coworking spaces. Tracing actants’ trajectories across this social field, the author argues for a conceptualization of entrepreneurs as knotworkers who mobilize genres, modes, languages, and spaces. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.""On October 22, 2012, six scientists and one civil servant were convicted of manslaughter for failing to properly warn the people of L’Aquila, Italy, of an impending earthquake that resulted in over 300 deaths and 1,500 injuries. This article investigates a key event leading up to this conviction: An emergency meeting of scientists, civil servants, and politicians to determine whether or not an advanced warning should be issued to the residents of L’Aquila. The following investigation of this emergency meeting uses functional stasis analysis to identify the primary breakdown in deliberation that ultimately led to a message of calm and reassurance immediately prior to the devastating earthquake.

Writers must be able to cooperate with subject-matter experts and team members to make effective decisions and complete projects. Scholarship also suggests that rapid changes in technology and changes in teaming processes challenge workplace communication and cooperation. Professional writers must be able to use complex software for projects that are often completed by multidisciplinary teams working remotely. Moreover, as technical writers shift from content developers to project managers, our responsibilities now include useradvocacy and supervision, further invigorating the need for successful communication. This article offers a different vision of an ancient heuristic-stasis theory-as a solution for the teaming challenges facing today's professional writers. Stasis theory, used as a generative heuristic rather than an eristic weapon, can help foster teaming and effective decision making in contemporary pedagogical and workplace contexts.""Although self-assessment is an important genre in both the academy and the workplace, it is often static. The resulting fixed identities are problematic in a creative economy that requires fluidity. Drawing on the work of Carruthers and Goffman, among others, we argue that memory and meditation, encompassing inventory and invention and coupled with rhetorical performance, constitute dynamic self-assessment. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.""This article pilots a study in statistical genre analysis, a mixed-method approach for (a) identifying conventional responses as a statistical distribution within a big data set and (b) assessing which deviations from the conventional might be more effective for changes in audience, purpose, or context. The study assesses pharmaceutical sponsor presentations at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug advisory committee meetings. Preliminary findings indicate the need for changes to FDA conflict-of-interest policies. © 2015 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""To test the theories that drive technical communication research, investigators may statistically analyze data gathered for descriptive or experimental studies. In such analyses, investigators often set a very small statistical risk of rejecting a true null hypothesis of no relationship between variables to avoid subsequently incorrectly accepting an alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship. By this normal procedure, investigators may unwittingly lower the statistical power to reject a false null hypothesis of no relationship, and, thereafter, they may incorrectly fail to accept the statistically alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship. Our purpose is to demonstrate how to use a statistical table for planning ahead to gain acceptable power and how to report the power fully in the results. Even after an experiment has been completed, investigators can still estimate and report the power. Careful attention to power contributes to more meaningful tests of theories, and good reporting gives readers a clearer picture of the meaning of the tests.""Changes in United States military specifications, standards, and amendments received in the period from July 1, 1973 through September 31, 1973 are listed.""Out of centuries of domination by males has come a language that subordinates females. Girls and women from birth are barraged with words that are harmful to their self-images. Traditionalists argue that the language should not be changed to bring women into equality because of the “sanc tity” of ancient language patterns. But which is more important, the improvement of social conditions or the protection of words whose roots lie in archaic languages and whose only claim to being “right” lies in their establishment by male-dominated cultures? Let's not sacrifice women at the altar of words and tradition. © 1977, Sage Publications.

Several methods, for use individually or in groups, that have been developed to stimulate creative problem solving are reviewed: brainstorming, question prompting, attribute listing, relationship forcing, morphological analysis, logical analysis, input-output system, and area thinking.""The growth of individuals investing in the stock of publicly traded companies in the late 1990s coincided with the development of new media outlets for equivocal financial data. Discussion board participants enact an assortment of messages, experience a number of texts simultaneously and therefore are always immersed within a multiplicity of discourses. One such cyberspace was examined to investigate participants' sensemaking related to their financial holdings. Through the use of Weick's double interact, discussion board participants make sense of and organize equivocal messages. For business communication practitioners, these sensemaking processes call for the creation of dialogic texts that engage readers on multiple levels. Limitations and future possibilities for research are surveyed. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""During the last 30 years, proposal writing has seen a succession of systems appear which have extended the historic writing technology of planning by subject outline and rough drafting for review. In 1962 the Hughes Sequential Topical Organization of Proposals (STOP) system introduced the modular format and topical storyboarding. In the 1970s Hyman Silver brought out Scenario, which emphasized requirements analysis and section storyboarding to discover proposal strategy. Also, Hudson Patton brought out his unique and successful graphics oriented (GO) technique to defeat “armwaving,” or inadequate substantiation of approach. In the 1980s, Shipley Associates taught us how to use action titles to improve salesmanship. All of these features and others were consolidated in the Hughes STOP and GO system (1981–1989), which provides an ideal combination of strategy, comprehensibility, credibility, and sales. STOP and GO represents the state of the art in proposal writing methodology. © 1992 IEEE""To help readers better understand the craft and the rhetorical power of narrative as used in corporate and community settings—and to illustrate strategies that rhetorical storytellers may employ. Method: This article analyzes storytelling by means of a case study in the art of narrative as used in support of an organization, community, and industry. The organization is Y-12 National Security Complex, which makes parts for America’s nuclear arsenal and does research and production in nuclear materials for medicine, biology, industry, and nuclear energy and propulsion. The community is Oak Ridge, Tennessee and environs. “Industry” references the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge and beyond, including its partnership with the U.S. military. The subject of the case study—the person whose narrative art is here analyzed—is Ray Smith, official historian of Y-12. The material analyzed comes from publications by Smith, notes from interviews with him on multiple occasions, and many sessions of listening to his stories both in person and via recordings (documentaries, presentations available on web sites, etc.). Results: This study finds that Smith’s stories connected with the Manhattan Project, and the years preceding and succeeding it, constitute a model set of narratives displaying the rhetorical power of storytelling in an organizational setting. Conclusion: By studying the ways narrative is successfully used in professional settings, we deepen our understanding of rhetorical storytelling as well as our ability to use it. This skill has wide application to contexts of technical and professional communication. It can be used to elevate public opinion about a corporation, community, or industry; to breed confidence among consumers and investors; to construct leadership models for managers; to inspire and motivate employees—and in virtually any other sort of rhetorical enterprise. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Along with the story of each editor, the article presents generalizations about the editing process in this particular organization. The description suggests that editing is a complex, meaning-making process. The three editors seem to make changes in the documents they edit based on their expert knowledge of writing, their empathy for readers, and their assumption of authority over a document. Although they all make rule-based changes that rely on external authorities, such as style manuals, they vary greatly in their readiness to use their personal authority in interpreting the needs of an audience. The editors gain the authority they need to make reader-based changes by assuming the role of language specialists and by enhancing the teaching role important in their organization. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The storyboard technique, with its modular format, enforces a writing discipline that sharpens the message, uncovers gaps in continuity, and optimizes the balance in discussions of constituent topics. Overall visibility of the entire proposal usually can be accomplished, permitting rapid comprehension of the quality of organizational and production parameters, and the effect of changes on these. Proposals printed in the storyboard format are more interesting and easier to read.""Storyboarding is an efficient technique that provides proposal managers and writers a disciplined, yet flexible, framework for planning, developing, and reviewing proposal text incrementally and sequentially. The technique facilitates intragroup communication so that all team members are aware of the “message” being developed to sell an approach to a customer's problem. A major benefit of storyboarding to proposal teams is that it encourages consistency which, in turn, ensures that the proposal complies with the customer's requirements and the bidder's win strategy. © 1989 IEEE""Drawing on an extended ethnographic study of the textual practices of economists at the Bank of Canada, this article looks at narrative construction as a communal process of corporate knowledge making. Employing theories of narrative, genre, and distributed cognition as a conceptual frame, the article traces three stages in the development of a narrative known in the bank as the monetary-policy story. Evolving across a number of written genres, this symbolic representation functions as an important site of intersubjectivity among the institution's economists. In its final form, the narrative serves the bank's executives as a shared cognitive and rhetorical resource for making decisions about monetary policy and communicating these decisions to the Canadian public. This account of knowledge making at the Bank of Canada may be useful as a heuristic for researchers studying the dynamics of discourse in other professional settings.""A reprint of the article from the February 1955 issue of the ""Babson Institute Alumni Bulletin"" is presented, discussing writing and sentencestructure.

Because current research suggests immediacy behaviors may indeed be present, we developed a strategy for measuring immediacy in an online MBA course and related the results to student grades on final team projects in the course. Learner-to-learner, noncontent-related statements showed minimal affective behavior, but that lack did not have a negative effect on grades. The study suggests that students do not automatically provide supportive feedback, compliment each other, and express appreciation or agreement unless the instructor builds a learning community and transfers interactive roles to the students themselves. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study investigates a distinct type of ethos, signalled ethos, and how it is used in eight business speeches. A rhetorical analysis of the speeches resulted in five categories of signalled ethos; the categories center around deference, self-criticism, similitude, expertise, and the inclination to succeed. The study examines the rhetorical functions of these categories and suggests that signalled ethos is a useful concept for understanding the types of images authors create of themselves. © 1991, Sage Publications.

It also discusses the origins of the misunderstanding of the role of these two skills in the technical writing classroom and demonstrates how this failure works against an efficient and successful technical writing program. Some suggestions are offered to remedy the existing problem but would form the base for a comprehensive technical communications curriculum.""Incorporating social and emotional skills (EI) training into the business communication curriculum is important for preparing students to function effectively in a global workplace with its complex informal networks, intercultural issues, team emphasis, and participatory leadership. EI skills enhance communication behavior in work groups and improve the quality of student responses to various business scenarios. Scientific research indicates that modeling social and emotional behavior is key to acquiring competency in these skills. This article describes four classroom strategies for developing EI skills in business communication courses. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""Technical writers rarely work on patent applications, but the typical documents writers prepare during research and development are important during patent disputes. Patent disputes are so costly that the potential for these disputes weighs heavily on the minds of those preparing patent applications. The relationship between technical documentation and the legal processes surrounding research and development need to shape a writer's documentation practice. Research question: What legal concepts do technical writers need to know when working in research and development? Key concepts: Patent prosecution is the process of obtaining a patent. Technology transfer is the communication that places an innovation into the marketplace. Patent disputes arise when a party believes its patent rights have been infringed. The work of technical writers becomes relevant during patent disputes. Two Supreme Court cases inform the process for reconstructing the meaning of patent claims during a dispute: Markman v. Westview, Instruments, Inc. and Phillips,v. AWH Corp. Markman limits the audience who determines the meaning of a claim to the judge instead of a jury, and Phillips establishes the role written documents have in a patent dispute. The Phillips case shows how a judge might use technical documentation to determine the meaning of a patent claim or term. From these cases, we can draw strategies for preparing technical documents. Key lessons: While impossible to know prior to a patent dispute how a document will affect the outcome of the dispute, technical communicators can adopt three strategies for preparing precise and complete documents. First, technical writers can adopt a 'liminal' practice-the ability to interact as needed with different disciplines. Second, technical communicators can approach new subjects with assent, a type of seeking understood in order to fully explore a new technology. And third, technical communicators can approach writing about research and development as a technical translation practice to translate highly scientific or technical language into precise plain language. Implications to practice: By developing a liminal practice, technical communicators can build a robust documentation practice that includes the contextual nuances essential for work in patent prosecution and technology transfer. © 2014 IEEE.""To understand how strategies of containment operate in recall notices, a writer or reader must first consider two goals that these notices attempt to accomplish. The first of these goals is obvious: a well-constructed recall notice entices a consumer into returning a defective product to the manufacturer, allowing the manufacturer to repair or replace the product. The second goal, while somewhat less obvious, is equally important: the recall notice controls damage to the manufacturer's reputation. Faced with the unpleasant task of recalling a product, the manufacturer can use that recall notice to mitigate its responsibility for the defective product and to demonstrate its concern for the consumer.""You know one when you see one, even though they come in all shapes and sizes. The titles of these small, hand-held publications usually contain the word guide, summary, or reference. Many of us in the documentation business have coined the terms job aid or quick reference to identify these small packages of information that readers can refer to at a moment's notice. Quick references are small, portable packages of information that can be seen in the pockets of programmers, high-tech equipment operators, and even shoppers at the grocery store. But where did they come from? What strange breed of documentation is this? Is there rhyme or reason in the design of quick reference documentation? This paper presents a description of various quick references and discusses their design. © 1988 IEEE""More than 1,600 serials from across the disciplines were identified as sources for technical communication scholars The 99 most frequently cited serials are described. This citation analysis is distinguished from others by the size of the database (25,000+ citations), the 10-year review of articles published in five technical communication journals between 1988 and 1997, the number of serials cited and reviewed, and the focus on technical communication as a discipline. The analysis yielded two observations. First, five technical communication journals have grown in strength as forums for discussions of technical communication. Second, the serials cited illustrate the diversity of resources referred to from business, education, psychology, science, and technology-related sources. As a discipline, technical communication has developed depth and rigor through building the base of its research and theory while integrating the research and theory gathered from a number of disciplines.""Faculty, departments, and colleges are being pressured by state legislatures, boards of trustees, and re-accreditation organizations to assess themselves and their prod uct aggressively. Assessment may deal with demographics, such as number of stu dents per class; perceived quality, such as the nurnber of publications by faculty; or by outcomes, such as who hires the graduates and how well the graduates per form. External advisors are helpful in conducting such evaluations. One such group is an alumni advisory board, which can be established and operate with min imal effort and cost, yet can yield many benefits. The Alumni Board of the Infor mation and Decision Systems Department at San Diego State includes recent graduates nominated by faculty, is targeted at about 75 members, and is queried several times a year on issues related to curriculum, new topics of interest to the classroom, and job trends. © 2002, Sage Publications.

These violations suggest failure of editors and teachers to get their message across and of writers to approach writing with fitting concern. The most frequent and significant violations are selected and explained. Speculation on causes and suggestions for elimination of the violations accompany the explanations."The document provision function, operating between publishers (suppliers) and libraries (customers) has typically been provided by not-for-profit organizations. It is argued that this has evolved because heretofore the combination of technology and copyright law has allowed the economic interest of the supplier to be ignored. The new copyright law, however, in addition to recognizing the interest of libraries, does make an explicit recognition of the supplier's economic interest. The classic supplier-customer relationship has been reestablished, and this has had a profound effect on how the document provision function should be structured.""The documentation describing a technical project or product frequently takes one of two forms: too little documentation to present the necessary information properly, or too much documentation poorly organized and poorly written. To help overcome this problem, a four-level approach to project documentation is described, with documents assigned to each level according to their intended use. The technical writer can then judge how to construct a given document because the audience for each documentation level is clearly defined. The four-level approach consists of Level 4 (Operational) for users, operators, or maintainers; Level 3 (Theoretical) for applications engineer or designer, technical salesman; Level 2 (Engineering) for design engineer, systems analyst, electronics technicians, machinists; Level 1 (Design and Archival) for scientist, research and development staff, contract administrator, tests laboratory.""We present a proposal for HDITA, an HTML5-based version of the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). We report on an exploratory study about the feasibility of using HDITA as an authoring platform for technical content. We asked how novice technical writers describe and evaluate the complexity and difficulty of the different stages of the HDITA authoring process and if novice technical writers can author effective topic-based technical content in HTML5 (HDITA) without full knowledge of XML (DITA). Method: To evaluate the feasibility of authoring and publishing with HDITA, we modified the Instructions assignment of an introductory college course called Technical Writing. Students wrote blog posts during the authoring process and completed a survey on the perceived difficulty of HDITA. We evaluated the quality of HDITA Web deliverables with college students from diverse technical and academic backgrounds. Results: Most author students were somewhat confident authoring technical content with HDITA, and most said they were very likely to somewhat likely to use HDITA in the future for technical writing projects. Students reported that the most difficult part of using HDITA involved Web templates and not HDITA itself. Twenty-seven students evaluated HDITA deliverables and gave them positive scores using a rubric for assessing quality technical information. Conclusion: Acknowledging the small number of student authors involved in this feasibility study, we can still conclude that novice technical writers did not perceive creating technical documentation with HDITA as difficult or highly complex. Most student evaluators were able to complete the assigned tasks following the instructions created in HDITA. © 2016. Society for Technical Communication.

An academic service-learning (ASL) component is included. Adopted as a required class for a master of science degree in accounting at two universities, this course supports accounting accreditation. Surveys offer evidence that both accounting practitioners and faculty rate, in slightly different order, the three most important skills as written communication, oral communication, and analytical/critical thinking. Accounting curricula worldwide are under pressure to develop better skills in these areas as well as to meet assessment and accreditation directives and criteria. The authors designed a communication course utilizing ASL that not only meets all of the above objectives but also provides the student with hands-on experiential learning. Information about this course provides a guide to accounting and business faculty who may wish to pursue such an approach in their schools. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""This tutorial is the outgrowth of a corporate request for a website critique by undergraduate, Net-Generation (Net-Gen) students. Fifty-four sophomores working in teams of four and five in the College of Business at the University of Southern Indiana critiqued the website of Kimball International.

In many scitech communications, the Appendix is the right place for detail not of immediate interest to most readers; this option is grossly under-utilized.""The author outlines the steps involved, from overall structure to word sequence. Several techniques can help a writer determine an effective overall structure; analyzing the audience, assessing audience needs, segmenting the report, structuring the report deductively or inductively, and sequencing sections of the report. Audiences for technical reports usually consist of more than one person. Moreover, these audiences may have different levels of expertise and different interests and needs. Therefore, knowing the audience is the first step to writing an accessible report. Listing both primary and secondary audiences, with their levels of expertise, their interests, and the specific content each requires, is a useful technique. The author gives examples of primary audiences (a laboratory supervisor and her director) and of secondary audiences (laboratory technicians and upper management), indicating the kinds of information each needs. Detailed suggestions for meeting these needs follow.""In this article, we present a usability experiment in which participants were asked to make intensive use of information on an intranet in order to execute job-related tasks. Participants had to work with one of two versions of an intranet: one with an organization-based hyperlink structure, and one with a task-based hyperlink structure. Efficiency and effectiveness were measured in terms of execution time and task accuracy, respectively. After the task execution, participants were asked to evaluate the task as well as the intranet. The results show that participants perform more efficiently with the organization-based structure, which is probably due to their familiarity with this structure. A post hoc analysis revealed, however, a learning effect in the task condition, which suggests that once users are acquainted with it, a task structure is at least as efficient.""This article examines editorial strategies revealed by employees at MAMM magazine, a publication covering breast cancer and other women's reproductive cancers. Drawing on personal interviews and on-site observations, the author discusses specific patterns of editorial decision making in two areas of cancer discourse: the presentation of medical information and the portrayal of survivors' identities. These patterns are tied to particular organizational, cultural, and ideological influences on editorial practices emphasized by participants in the study as well as to economic outcomes for the publication. © 2005 Sage Publications.""This case study, an example of scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) research, explores student motivations to collaborate with both peer teams and community partners in a service-learning course. Written by one instructor and three undergraduates, the article draws on personal narratives, student reflections, and a postcourse student survey. Our experiences and findings suggest that in courses like these positive extrinsic factors motivate students to collaborate in ways that the extrinsic motivators in typical assignments do not, helping to foster trust and shared goals. We also share our work as an example of how to include student voices in SoTL work. © The Author(s) 2014.""Writing comments on student papers takes tremendous effort, and this study attempted to determine how students use these comments, the importance of the comments, and methods to encourage students to use comments. The results revealed that students' course grades did not correlate with their use of comments; however, students were likely to review comments if they had to rewrite assignments. Significant differences existed between course grades and these variables: (a) how well students read comments, (b) how useful com ments were, (c) how well students understood comments, and (d) how likely students were to get help in understanding comments."The author has developed an approach to the major report that allows the student to assume the role of a consultant in his field while simultaneously permitting him to feel independent and creative. The inexperienced technical writer must create a realistic situation in which someone would require the technical information he wishes to convey. Placing the student in the role of a consultant makes him more aware of his audience and its needs. This problem-oriented approach effectively increases the writer's liberty to choose an appropriate topic and his responsibility to present it in a coherent and professional manner.Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALGains) is a Web-based instrument for measuring student perception of their learning in a variety of courses. The authors adapted this instrument to measure students' achieved proficiency in analyzing cases in an advanced business communication class. The instrument showed that students did achieve a high level of proficiency and that they did so equally in both traditional and online classes. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication."Business communication students at two midwestern universities were polled on the first day of the 1995 spring term to determine their (1) written com naunication assignment likes Idislikes; (2) oral communication assignment likes/dislikes; (3) experience using e-mail; and (4) attitudes toward written, oral, and e-mail communication. The 144 respondents viewed oral communi cation less positively than they did either written or e-mail communication. Significant differences were found among overall ratings for oral, written, and e-mail communication. In addition, students with prior e-mail experience gave significantly higher ratings to it and to oral communication than did those who had not used e-mail. © 1997, Sage Publications.

As teaching technical writing online becomes more widespread, teachers and scholars are identifying ways to increase teaching/learning efficacy. One way of accomplishing this goal is by continually reflecting on different types of student ethos being constructed in an online course. The changes that occur in the ethos development process can be contextualized through activity theory, which emphasizes the dynamic, evolving nature of social environments. Activity theory's focus on cultural history and tools makes it ideal for exploring active communication among multiple participants in an online technical communication environment. The triangle of human activity adapted and developed by Engestrom (1987) provides a framework for exploring ethos as an object within an online course's activity system. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.""The following article is a report of a survey funded by ABCA to determine how students evaluated their first course in business communication.

This qualitative study explores the role of the internship in narrowing the work expectation-reality gap. This article addresses two research questions: (a) What do students learn about work through internships that they did not know before? (b) How is this new knowledge reflected in their advice to future interns? Analysis of 59 intern exit interviews or surveys reveals two categories of communication-related discovery that in turn influenced subsequent advice messages. Practical implications for business curriculum and career development programs are discussed. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""There is little question among educators and business executives that excellent communication skills are requisites for today's jobs. Yet most business teachers realize the difficulty of getting students to take business communication courses seriously. Succcessful teachers know that students learn best when they value what they are learning as relevant. Teachers can often create learning environments that stimulate students’ enthusiasm for learning if they can relate topics taught in school to career or life goals of students. This study was conducted to assist students in becoming more aware of business communica tion tasks they will be expected to complete when they enter the business world. The goal is to provide information to help create a learning environ ment where the significance of communication is recognized and appreciated. The study sought to answer this question: What are students’ perceptions con cerning their future business communication tasks? © 1998, Sage Publications.

But more is known about this process from the viewpoint of instructors than from the perspective of students. The purpose of this study was to formally examine student views of a specific peer-review system in which undergraduates assigned final grades to each other's term papers. A survey instrument revealed a high degree of comfort with the process, as well as some insights into why a few students were uncomfortable with it.""This study attempted to determine student perceptions of the value of using a prewriting problem-solving plan and its relationship to their success in writ ing. The business communication students in the study felt that the plan was beneficial, particularly for persuasive messages, individual writing, and small- group writing. In addition, participants seemed to feel that the plan was worth preparing even when not required as part of the assignment. The results sug gest that the problern-solving plan can be a useful tool for complicated assign ments and group work but that it should probably be optional for simple assignments.""Student portfolios are a tool that academic institutions can implement to enhance students' job search processes. Students can enhance their ability to pass the initial screening process by preparing a portfolio that identifies their goals and provides evidence that they possess the skills and qualities to reach these goals. The portfolio should emphasize communication skills, as they are deemed most important by employers in the initial screening process. When preparing a portfolio, students should consider a variety of media, including paper, videotape, and compact disk. Schools that implement student portfolios must decide if all students will be required to prepare them, if the administrators will determine the contents, and who will approve the contents of students' portfolios.""This article describes the process of planning and implementing a problem-based learning community. Business and communication students from a large university in the Western United States competed in teams to solve an authentic business problem posed by a Fortune 500 company. The company's willingness to adopt some of their recommendations testified to the professional quality of their final product. This experience gave students an opportunity to apply communication concepts to a business problem. They learned how to make vital connections between theory and practice and between shared knowledge and shared knowing. In the process, students grew personally and professionally.""Undergraduate business communication students were surveyed to determine their perceived most effective method of assessment on writing assignments. The results indicated students' preference for a process that incorporates visual, auditory, and e-handwritten presentation via a tablet PC. Students also identified this assessment process would improve their writing by helping them understand the types of errors they were making and why these errors were incorrect. Students also indicated this type of assessment would help build a relationship with the instructor and help them be successful in the class. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Situated learning theory postulates that the environment in which learning occurs is foundational to understanding the outcomes of that learning. Taking classes in a nontraditional classroom, therefore, might have a noticeable effect on learning outcomes. This study examines three structures of the same general education course to understand the potential impact of mediated learning on students’ public speaking and writing apprehension and self-efficacy. Although situated learning theory suggests that the three structures (face-to-face, partially face-to-face, and fully online) should demonstrate differences, the results of this study are mixed, suggesting a complicated picture for situated learning’s ability to speak to differences based on technology use while highlighting the differences in how such technology might affect oral skills versus written skills. The application of situated learning principles to technologically mediated courses demonstrates the need to consider the interplay between environment and content. © The Author(s) 2016.""This study explores the intersections between facework, feedback interventions, and digitally mediated modes of response to student writing. Specifically, the study explores one particular mode of feedback intervention—screencast response to written work—through students’ perceptions of its affordances and through dimensions of its role in the mediation of face and construction of identities. Students found screencast technologies to be helpful to their learning and their interpretation of positive affect from their teachers by facilitating personal connections, creating transparency about the teacher’s evaluative process and identity, revealing the teacher’s feelings, providing visual affirmation, and establishing a conversational tone. The screencast technologies seemed to create an evaluative space in which teachers and students could perform digitally mediated pedagogical identities that were relational, affective, and distinct, allowing students to perceive an individualized instructional process enabled by the response mode. These results suggest that exploring the concept of digitally mediated pedagogical identity, especially through alternative modes of response, can be a useful lens for theoretical and empirical exploration. © The Author(s) 2016.""This article is a bibliographical essay on the history of business and technical writing based on a survey of over 200 articles and books that demonstrate not only the quality and quantity of recent publications in this field but also the wide opportunities it offers for future research. The studies in the article and bibliography are grouped into 13 categories according to historical period (from ancient and classical times through the twentieth century), national origin, and (for twentieth-century studies) subject of investigation. The article concludes with suggestions about further research in the history of business and technical writing. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Specifically, a study was designed to test differences between the same writers revising and editing at a word processor and with pen and paper. Revising was designated as changes writers made to texts they wrote themselves, and editing as changes writers made to texts written by another author. This distinction between revising and editing becomes important when we consider that different results emerged depending on which of the two processes the writers were using. Sums and averages were gathered on the following: (a) The total time writers worked on each of the tasks; (b) the number of sessions (or the times, including the first) that the writers returned to each task; (c) the number of words revised or edited in the final copy; (d) the number of sentences in the final revised or edited copy; (e) the mean number of words per sentence; and (f) the total number of changes made in each text. Results suggest that the word processor directly alters a writer's composing style.""Security classification in science and technology has aroused strong feelings, but there is little objective information about its effects. This paper presents the opposing, and highly subjective, points of view; summarizes objective studies of information flow; and reports an investigation of the flow of restricted and unrestricted information in a large research-and-development laboratory. The investigation showed that security classifications had little effect on the laboratory's procedures and output; however, additional research is indicated. Altogether, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining empirical data on the effects of security classification on technical communication - data that are much needed, in view of the ongoing controversy.""An examination of the files of a scientific journal demonstrates a deep editorial concern for style and arrangement. Stylistic changes are invariably made either for the sake of clarity, simplicity, concision, or specificity. Changes in arrangement are of two kinds, each with its own purpose: between paragraphs within sections, these changes are made in the interest of sequential clarity; on the other hand, redistributions from section to section are designed clearly to demarcate section content: e. g. , results only in Results. Several conclusions are reached: 1) traditional advice, especially on style, does not always reflect best editorial practice; 2) problems of arrangement call for different kinds of solution from those of style: the former having a 'best,' the latter only a 'better' solution; 3) stylistic changes are tactical choices made within the context of strategic presuppositions about the impersonal and descriptive nature of scientific prose.""This paper explains the usefulness of the style guide as a cost reduction tool. The major areas of technical manual production are listed, and examples are provided of how the style guide can reduce costs in each area.""This article studies the stylistic variation in the design of administrative forms in three European countries - the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain - through the linguistic analysis of a small corpus of multilingual administrative forms dealing with pension benefits and other kinds of allowances written in four different languages - English, Spanish, Italian, and German. The analysis included both monolingual administrative forms - written in English, Spanish, and Italian - and bilingual Italian/German and Italian/ English forms. The purpose of the study was to search for cross-linguistic regularities in the design of administrative forms which would enable their characterization as a genre, both in terms of its staging structure and of the linguistic and formatting features of the elements which configure it as such. The analysis performed on the small corpus yielded interesting stylistic differences and tendencies in the design of comparable administrative forms in the different countries, characterized by different socio-cultural back-grounds. It is suggested that these differences are a reflection of the social attitudes of the different administrations toward their citizens.""E-mail style has received little attention from corporations and other institutions. The absence of stylistic guidelines may create problems: Communicating inappropriately with some audiences, losing sight of the message purpose, or wasting company resources in other ways. To solve such problems, technical communicators can use their unique abilities to promote e-mail formats that consider the strengths and limitations of the medium in addition to the traditional concerns with audience, purpose, and content of messages. © 1994 IEEE""Significant portions of the Copyright Law of 1976 are extracted, including subject matter of copyright, works of the U.

This can be accomplished in a number of ways. In fact, it is not unusual to convert systems several times to find the best way of fulfilling subscriptions. The advent of the computer has made it possible to gather statistics and demogaphics more easily, and an analysis of the statistics is a basic tool in new promotion. As costs increase, greater selectivity is needed in list selection, advertising, and special offers. The basic source of subscribers is renewals. As much, if not more, effort should be spent on obtaining renewals as on seeking new subscribers.""Compliance with unrealistic Proposal Preparation Instructions and Instructions to Offerors often prevents preparation of proposals that respond effectively to the solicitation and that are easy to read and evaluate.

The author emphasizes the importance of context when giving writing assignments, noting audience and purpose. Additionally, the author discusses a three step method of teaching technical description by using a game that involves ordering, classifying, and partitioning, an example of real world excellent technical description, and assigning a student generated descriptive report. This sequence of assignments builds upon one another to address both context and audience.""This study involved tabulating and analyzing information received from 275 periodicals publishing articles in busincss, economics, and related fields.

Taken together, these propositions represent an argument that connects and clarifies the associations between micro-level supervisor-subordinate communication behaviors and macro-level organizational learning. We explain how command structures produce relational contexts that create consequences for communication behaviors between subordinates and their supervisors. Specifically, we explain how subordinates' reluctance to disagree with supervisors results in silence or equivocation-what the authors label the hierarchical mum effect. In turn, we describe how this organizational suppression of dissent produces a barrier to organizational learning and adaptation. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""An experimental design was used to study supervisory-subordinate group decision making of eight groups under three conditions: supervisor physically present; super visor present via audio teleconferencing; supervisor present via audio/graphics telecon ferencing. Two group decisions were made under each condition. Decision quality, communication style and participant satisfaction were measured for each condition. In addition, qualitative assessments were conducted at the end of the study. No statistic ally significant differences were found on any of the dependent variables. The qualita tive analysis also indicated no differences among the treatments. The implication of this study is that supervisory/subordination group communication via telecommunica tions rather than physical presence affects neither subordinate group decision making nor interaction. © 1992, Sage Publications.

But TPC struggles with the complexities of determining which humans are at the center of our work. This article proposes that an explicit consideration of human dignity and human rights can help us to navigate these complexities by reflecting upon whether our work harmonizes with the notion that every person has intrinsic worth. To illustrate, I present findings from exploratory research with nonelite Rwandan youth in which participants conveyed the roles and effects of technology-mediated communication and information and communication technology in their lives. I assert that as TPC begins engaging more explicitly with human dignity and human rights, we should adopt a perspective inspired by human-centered design scholar Richard Buchanan: embracing human dignity and human rights as the first principle of communication and the foundational value of the TPC field. © The Author(s) 2016.""This article presents an experimental pedagogical framework for providing technical professionals with practice on writing skills focusing on the development of their metacognitive rhetorical awareness.

This information complements information gathered from surveys of business and industrial employers and of technical graduates on the job. The results of the survey suggest the desirability of increased technical communication course emphasis on oral reports and simulating professional communication activities. The survey also suggests specific areas for emphasis in the teaching of organization, format, and style.""Formal classroom instruction and literature in the field never replace the learning that occurs from actual experience in the workplace.

These changes have been widely discussed in the literature of the field, and this article traces their impact on technical communicators in Finland, a high-cost country where downturns in the export industry and the downsizing of major employers are currently coinciding. Through the framework of activity theory, the article looks at the historical changes in the industry as sources of tension and contradictions that need to be understood in order to support professionals in the industry. With the help of interview data, the authors explore the tensions experienced by technical communication professionals in the face of such changes. This analysis leads to the formulation of a hypothesis of historical contradictions currently at play in the field of technical communication. Developmental potentials stemming from these contradictions are outlined as potential ways forward for technical communicators who notice similar tensions in their own environments. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""As a result of recent environmentalist attacks, environmental legislation, and a weakening economy, Southern California's Ganahl Lumber Company faces asituation which threatens its image, resources, financial viability, and survival. Using qualitative data gathering techniques (i.e., employee interviews and examinations of organizational documents), this study examines the ways in which Ganahl Lumber has responded to these concerns. Specifically, this study identifies whom Ganahl Lumber employees perceive to be their most important audiences and focuses on the different communication strategies that the company is using to influence these audiences. Conclusions indicate that, although the company is attempting to alleviate the problems it faces by sending direct persuasive messages, and by presenting a positive image of itself to its employees and customers, little is being done to influence the company's surrounding community. To explain these results, the concepts of egocentric organizations (Morgan, 1986) and strong cultures (e.g., Bullis & Tompkins, 1989) are employed. © 1995, Sage Publications.

The authors investigated sustainability-related discourse directed to and created by employees representing two organizations engaged in a supply chain relationship. CRAWDAD was used to map the concepts appearing in (a) each company's sustainability-related training material, and (b) sustainability-focused interviews conducted with employees. Shared terms in the training documents included the following: corporate mission, corporate performance, corporate responsibility, product (healthy, sustainable, design), price, packaging, reduced waste, energy (reduction, use), and carbon emission. Overlaps between training texts and interview comments revolved around key corporate business goals as well as sustainability as the right thing to do. In the interviews, value statements (e.g., sustainability as the right thing to do or a ""good way to do business"") were especially strong. Within both text and talk, the buyer-supplier relationship was emphasized. Areas of divergence between talk and text and between organizations were identified. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This special issue attempts to situate the Technical Communication Body of Knowledge (TCBOK) within the framework of other bodies of knowledge to understand the relationship between a profession and its BOK. The issue also investigates how approaches such as developing taxonomies, engaging communities of practice, and constructing framing metaphors can inform the evolution and content strategy for a body of knowledge or an organization-specific knowledge base. Method: Reviewing the literature on developing bodies of knowledge and consulting with academics and practitioners on specific developmental goals and objectives for the TCBOK led us to posit three areas for focused investigation: constructing information taxonomies, engaging users and developers as a community of practice, and employing conceptualizing metaphors that can guide development without sacrificing complexity. Results: The articles' explorations of content strategy, information taxonomies, and user engagement are shown to be relevant for developing both company-specific information standards and field-wide bodies of knowledge. We leave open the question of whether use of conceptualizing metaphors belong more to construction of a BOK than to a set of standards. Conclusions: The TCBOK is a healthy, maturing collaborative project, which perhaps indicates we have matured as a field, and explains who we are and what we do as a field. It articulates the boundaries of knowledge in our field and the value added to the profession. Continued development and maintenance of TCBOK will benefit from continuing research into the relationship that professions sustain between their body of knowledge and disciplinary practices in the field and in the academy.""Networks have a remarkable ability to bring people together in communities, both online and offline, but such community building is not the only possible result of network use. This article examines the case of a tagging network on Twitter, the online social networking service characterized by short messages. Although Twitter has many social features that foster interaction between users, the use of hashtags to signal the topic of a message exists outside of the site's primary social structures, creating a unique writing environment. This article analyzes a hashtagged exchange surrounding the 2009 health care debate in the United States, examining the social features of this exchange and how participants used it to communicate about that debate. While traditional social features were certainly present within the exchange, they were not prominent or common; rather, users engaged the network properties of this exchange to make connections with other networks, drawing on a form of network power called switching. The analysis focuses on how the Twitter network's structural features affect communication between users. © The Author(s) 2013.""To better understand how individuals, groups, and organizations can use information systems more effectively, a research approach closer to the level of social interchange is required. A multiple-level, sustainable, information-technology (IT) learning framework, rooted in patterns of practice and constructed by participatory action research, offers an alternative methodology for investigating sustainable strategies of IT learning. The framework evolved from concrete instances of IT learning across organizational case studies. A patterns-based analysis of the ethnographic data enabled the examination of informal IT learning in community contexts and the identification of IT interventions more likely to produce successful learning outcomes. © 2010 IEEE.""System design for communication packages involves assessing communication needs and designing a set of communication vehicles to meet these needs. An earlier article dealt with needs assessment. After presenting three axioms of communication system design, this article reviews the basic input design - the needs assessment matrix - and then discusses the implications of this input and additional design considerations. Finally, the article presents a seven-step process that can be used to formalize communication system design.

Because these programs are intended to prepare students to perform competently as professionals, their curricula ought to be based upon a detailed and accurate description of the work that a technical communicator does. Unfortunately, there is little published research that systematically analyzes the job of the technical communicator. This article reports one attempt to remedy that shortage."An explanation of differences of individuals in engineering communications skills places common problems in several psychological contexts. Individual and corporate personality types are examined along with standard approaches to improving communications. Group communication patterns are analyzed and systematic techniques are presented which add behavioral psychological considerations to the mechanics of generating valuable communications."This paper addresses some major changes occurring in scientific and technical journal publishing and the implications of these changes on scientists, publishers, and libraries - as a system. Particular attention is given to the interdependences among these participants. Hypotheses are given for the overall impact of changes such as a national periodicals system, increased interlibrary loaning, the Copyright Law of 1976, and changes in page charges. Implications of possible new directions are also discussed.""This approach to the control of writing costs is a systematized method to leaven and identify important cost factors to the management level. It periodically provides in-depth visibility into pertinent scope and productivity variations which have a significant impact on the success of writing programs. Elemental cost factors in consistent terms enhance the visibility as production quantities give measurements unusual objectivity in a relatively subjective environment. Because of the subjectiveness, data values at the program level must be management-tempered. Here they are used principally to flag problem areas where their meaning is paramount. Long term cumulative values (over many writingprograms) become more meaningful as true absolute values. Because of this quality, they are used to set work standards, define writer productivity, and determine other departmental factors.""Systems design consists of a tremendously complex series of choices in which no decision point is completely independent of other decisions which have already been made or have yet to be made. A systems approach to the design of document-handling information systems would require a detailed examination of the choices to be made in the design process and the ramifications of possible choices in terms of the capabilities, performance, cost, and other characteristics of the system. The authors advocate a systematic procedure involving six steps: 1) identification of fixed parameters, 2) identification of variable parameters, 3) identification of available options for each variable parameter, 4) identification of factors affecting a choice among available options, 5) identification of factors affected by a choice among available options, and 6) logical analysis of the picture thus presented to determine the optimum sequence in which decisions should be made during the designing process and the nature of the decision process itself.""A model is proposed of the scientific journal as a specialized communication medium embedded in a highly unstructured communication process; its salient characteristics are found in its specialized process for continuously sampling, filtering, and converting the flow of ideas into a stable and visible form. Its specialized functions depend upon the potentialcontributors, the immediate (and long range) readership, and the purpose of the journal, which may range from current event reporting to archival, from theory to application, from tutorial to dialectic, and the like. A wide variety of both old and innovative techniques are presented which may be useful in making improvements, and especially in establishing and maintaining a shared view of function with both contributors and readers. Not only the editorial and content sections of the journal but also supplementary means, such as instructions to authors, are discussed.""The author describes how the existing abilities and skills of technical writers can be organized in a new way to support systems integration, and addresses some considerations for technical writers who will meet the challenge of this career change.""In the teaching of communication studies to engineering and commerce students, the time available for teaching communication principles and models did not allow for a detailed study of the various models currently in use. A systems model based on a consistent and limited terminology was developed. This model consists essentially of three subsystems; the human system, the message transfer system, and intermediate receiver-storage-transmitter systems. With the use of this system approach, it is possible to construct models of any human communication system and to use these models to analyze and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the different systems.""Despite the prominent role of application forms in the process of composing grant proposals, little attention has been given to the rhetorical and ethical implications of their prompts and instructions.

One possible solution to the information overload involves the use of graphic aids within written material. Graphic aids can be used to illustrate trends and relationships that are not readily understood in verbal form. The use of graphics is further supported because of technological advancement, which allows costs of utilization to decrease. This article reports the research that has been conducted on the effect of graphic presentation. The majority of the research shows that tables and graphics can have a positive effect on the comprehension of material.""The concepts of tacit knowledge, knowledge management, and the active user participation in website navigation are discussed. If tacit knowledge is not calculated for in the design of a website, it puts the people navigating the site in the position of passive observers. While the information being provided should be content-rich and specific, there might also be further mention of redundancy of information, imaginative link designations, or connectivity afforded by links that would allow for some sense of creative chaos and interaction.""Free online survey tools provide a practical learning-by-induction platform for business communication instructors interested in trying out an advanced multidisciplinary survey activity coupled with an innovative teaching design. More than just building skills in marketing, survey projects marshal a wider set of thinking and doing activities that build student competency in the interrelated disciplines of communication, consumer analysis, and research.

However, the coverage of sustainability issues in business courses remains small at many universities. This article illustrates how business communication students can become cognitively, behaviorally, and emotionally involved in the analysis and evaluation of the complex sustainability paradigm via an assignment focusing on sustainability. The approach integrates several levels of learning, stretching students' cognitive skills and enhancing the emotional competencies and behavioral skills needed to enter high-level business jobs. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Discourse theories frequently emphasize the importance of understanding audience but seldom delve into how writers form conceptions of their audiences, especially in organizations. This study examines computer documentation writers' tactics for conceiving of their audiences. Based on two ethnographic case studies and insights from activity theory, the author describes and evaluates technical communicators' tactics for understanding audiences, constrained and supported by their organizations. She discusses the advantages and limitations of each tactic, looking at how each tactic might answer questions about audience. This research should be useful to technical communication educators as they expand students' options for audience research in nonacademic settings. In addition, the findings of this study can enhance theories about the ways writers create images of their audiences.""The chronicle of a global approach to information communication design (ICD) does not always translate when applied to cultures in countries around the world. In this study, I wanted to know if the designers of Souq.com relied solely on the universal principles of ICD to build a uniquely Arabized and successful site. Equally, I wanted to discover what other dimensions are in play when it comes to designing content for target users. Method: I reviewed the literature and developed a framework based on key indicators of ICD. I then analyzed the layout and Web content of Souq.com by examining interface and content, focusing on the homepage. Results: The principles of ICD, while foundational, require additional knowledge in order to meet the needs of local users and to build a sense of ownership of those principles. The process of designing for local users can benefit from insider knowledge and singular interpretation of a people’s culture, language, and traditions. Conclusion: ICD is invaluable for the basic framework it offers. However, its principles are in themselves insufficient when it comes to designing not globally but locally. © 2016.

Research questions: (1) What is the typical makeup of a technical communication program advisory board? (2) What function do these advisory boards serve? (3) What are the typical successes and challenges of starting and maintaining a technical communication advisory board? (4) What are best practices for starting and maintaining a successful advisory board? (5) What are the similarities and differences in how program administrators and board members perceive the benefits and functions of the board? Literature review: Literature on advisory boards in technical and business communication - and in related fields such as communication, journalism, and marketing - reports that advisory boards are beneficial and effective, though many include caveats or recommendations about ways to improve board function. Methodology: To provide perspectives from both sides of the academy-industry relationship, we conducted 18 semistructured phone, Skype, and in-person interviews with program administrators (n = 10) from a host of nationwide programs and with board members (n = 8) from a single advisory board. Results and discussion: The study finds that the typical advisory board involves a mix of industry, faculty, and student members, with an emphasis on industry members. They advise the program about its curricular concerns, often foster students' academic and professional maturation, and support the program in conflicts with university administration. The typical successes of advisory boards included positive curricular amendment and the recruitment of students for jobs and internships, while characteristic challenges included meeting logistics and board members' concerns regarding the program's response to their advice. Program administrators and board members both perceive a board as useful, but some members expressed concern about the uncertainty of their role and influence. The results suggest that all technical communication programs should seriously consider forming an advisory board based on disciplinary best practices, that existing advisory boards should ensure that they have clarified the board's role for their program, and that stakeholders are aware of and attend to their board members' concerns. © 1988-2012 IEEE."Public health professionals use a matrix called the logical framework to plan programs.  The framework helps define and appraise the relationships among activities and results.  Factors used to judge the success of a program must be explicitly defined in advance."Many current teaching practices in undergraduate technical communications are insensitive to students' career needs because they are based on mistaken notions concerning writing and the process of communication. The specific problem ares in current teaching practices include: the lack of emphasis on rewriting and on the cooperative element of technical communication, the overreliance on proscriptive strictures in graphics instruction, and the undue emphasis on large-group oratory in oral communications. Academic teaching methods need to be better informed by the practices and procedures of professional technical communicators in order to correct their mistaken notions and to more effectively meet students' career needs.""This article explores the design choices for Network Earth, a museum exhibit that introduced the general public to computer networks and related issues. The exhibit was one of three studied in a larger research project to develop a grounded model of design for learning in museums. Network Earth was developed by a team that had neither formal training nor academic credentials usually associated with museum exhibits. Although the design process and some of the general goals were similar to those at other sites studied and in the literature, certain practices differed. The team excluded historical objects, let donors influence content, and used different terminology. These differences appear to be cultural. With a limited affiliation with the occupational culture of museum exhibit design, the Network Earth team made choices that were more consistent with the culture of high technology - the subject of the museum and the industry that provided most of its financial support."Reports results of an investigation of cultural rhetorical factors that cause problems for American users of Chinese-created Web sites Examines the underlying cultural factors that could contribute to such communication differences.Argues that usability testing in new environments and with diverse equipment and instructions requires considering a wider range of logistics  Offers lessons learned from this experience."For some time, writing teachers have used audio feedback to assess students' work.

It draws on a survey of 240 principals of these businesses, brief interviews with half of them, and an analysis of their sites. Results show that search engines are among the most helpful methods leading people to these business sites and that higher levels of such search engine helpfulness are strongly associated with higher percentages of clientele who originate through these sites. Most businesses take search engines into account at least minimally; however, meaningfully pursuing that audience requires ongoing investments that some technical communication businesses are reluctant to make. © 2009 IEEE.""This article investigates student behaviour on collaborative assignments, looking at the relationship between task type and interaction, and considers the implications for task design. Students reported on interactions in a year-long workplace-focussed group communication project, comparing these with interactions on other academy-based group assignments. Differences were seen in the amount of brainstorming, the criteria for dividing up work, the intensity of editing, and how conflict was managed. Contributing factors to these differences included the presence or absence of a creative element, the instrumental nature of the task, and the need for a collective approach inherent in the task design. © The Author(s) 2014.""This essay sheds light on the relationship between the characteristics of second‐year MBA student writing groups and the quality of their group‐writtenreports. The study included an evaluation of the reports using an assessment instrument designed for the study and an evaluation of group characteristicsusing a questionnaire administered orally and in writing to groups. The most significant correlation between the groups and their writing was the group'shistory, namely, whether individuals chose to form a team on the basis of having worked together previously on a writing project and whether the team worked together previously on a long report.""Describes the theory of situated learning, which underlies the selection of a form for supporting performance Suggests how to apply this concept to the selection of forms""This study examines the impact of two facets of income tax law complexity-text and content complexity-to determine the effect of variation in style on professional tasks. The research results deal with the effectiveness of standard readability tests for profes sional readers, as well as how our tax laws should be drafted. The study shows that text presentation style magnifies the complexity of difficult tax law concepts. Also, results indicate that the Reading Complexity Evaluation Index is a better measure for technical writing than standard readability tests currently used by industry and government agencies. © 1992, Sage Publications.

Over one-third of the engineers employed in industry are responsible for corporate managerial responsibilities. Nearly all engineers are involved in ordering, follow-through and acceptance of goods and services, scheduling, personnel requirements, and costs. In addition to their traditional concern with technology, engineers are also concerned with administrative and managerial techniques. The author discusses a course offered at the University of Wisconsin in which professors assume the role of a company manager and present students with situations in which they are assigned positions on a proposal team.""The author has taught a distance education version of the undergraduate technical communication service course at Boise State University since 1997 and shares the strategies he has found to decrease the time instructors spend teaching online, thereby enabling them to use the time they do have to enhance their students' online experience. These strategies are distributed among four areas: management of collaboration, presentation of course material, grading, and interaction with students. For each one, the author presents the problems that may occur and approaches to resolving them. The article addresses a number of concerns expressed in the scholarly literature on distance education and is informed by surveys given to five sections of the author's course taught between 2001 and 2003. Interspersed through the article is an overview of some of the current research and commentary on distance education of particular interest to those teaching the technical communication service course via the Internet.""This article describes the writer's experiences teaching American business writing in Russia and attempting to find documents for comparison of Russian and American approaches to business communication. She discovered that most documents common in the United States are rare or nonexistent in Karelia, where in many ways organizational culture is oral culture; documents exist largely to show to officials rather than to communicate with customers, clients, superiors, or subordinates. Although Hall's model of high-context communication accounts for some cultural differences between Americans and Russians, it is important to note the differences between Russians operating in official mode and in personal mode to understand the amount of explicitness and directness appropriate in various situations.""To teach an in-house public speaking course, the instructor defined the purposes of the course to: (1) make available the training in the skills needed to make an effective presentation, (2) select the effective visual aids to be used in the presentation, (3) learn effective techniques of body language, (4) organize facts and ideas for the presentation, (5) construct the presentation for maximum impact, (6) analyze an audience, (7) establish rapport with the audience and keep its attention, and (8) improve speech, gestures, delivery, and timing. In addition, the instructor must consider the following aspects of the course: the schedule, the size of the class, the number of sessions, the texts, the methods of instruction, and the evaluation of the course. Included are the course of study and the assignments.""Students attempting to edit Technical Writing for the first time are often intimidated by what appears to be an impenetrable mass of peculiar-looking words. To help make the writing easier for students to analyze and edit, the author has developed several teaching techniques. One of them, 'telegramming,' is described in this article. This particular idea for analyzing technical writing grew out of the communication theory developed by Claude Shannon in the late 1940s. In technical writing, this means that 40 to 70 percent of the words (the 'fat factor') can be deleted without seriously compromising the message. How does this apply to technical writing?""Virtual teams collaborate across distances using information communication technologies (ICTs). A distinctive set of communication skills is needed by people who work successfully in virtual teams, and few universities or companies provide structured education and training in virtual teamwork. At a midsized southeastern Masters Comprehensive University, professors from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education came together to explore how they might use cross-disciplinary student teams (groups comprised of students with different backgrounds and educational goals) to teach concepts in their own disciplines while providing students with the opportunity to become more proficient in virtual team communication. Research questions: (1) Can cross-disciplinary student team projects successfully support learning in virtual team communication as well as address the learning objectives of specific courses? (2) What can faculty learn from a cross-disciplinary teaching model that can be applied to virtual teams? Situating the case: Experiential learning is based on performing real tasks and reflecting on that process; it benefits learners by engaging them in complex, authentic situations. Virtual teams are significant because they support a great deal of the work currently taking place in our global economy; they are significant in higher education because students need to develop skills in international virtual communication before they are introduced to high-stakes work environments. In previous cases, students have collaborated across national cultures to develop project deliverables, such as websites, reports, and usability studies and present them in virtual environments using such tools as WebEx, Skype, and live streaming. How this case was studied: The findings from this case are based on individual student reflections, which were used to create a data matrix for each project, and instructor observation and evaluation. About the case: In Spring 2013, six faculty from the same university worked together to incorporate virtual teams into their classrooms. These six faculty members were divided into two groups of three with each group representing three colleges mentioned earlier. The faculty developed two interdisciplinary projects (one on infographics and another on social media) that enabled rich and diverse student collaboration. In both groups, the three faculty leaders worked together to define a project scope that students could achieve and that would relate to learning goals in each discipline. Conclusions: The lessons learned from this experience are that: (1) technical challenges will occur; (2) students from all disciplines must receive the same information; (3) instructors must balance respect for their colleagues and support for their students; (4) team assignments need to be consistent and fair; (5) instructors need to establish appropriate and fair assessment measurements for their own students; and (6) projects need to be realistic in order to show the students the value of virtual work. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Virtual teams collaborate across distances using information communication technologies (ICTs).

Both novice and experienced computer users alike must master the use of Internet tools quickly, while also working to overcome conceptual misunderstandings about the technology and its root metaphors. The technology also makes commenting on student documents cumbersome but does have the benefit of creating a digitized record of students' writing processes, while also allowing for the on-line publication of students' work. Other benefits include more active learning and better interactive collaboration. Preliminary assessments further indicate that, despite critics' concerns about the rigor and quality of distance learning, for a variety of technical and social reasons, student work is equal to and sometimes better than that of on-campus students. © 1996 IEEE.""Because business communication texts take a product-oriented approach to arrangement, business writers tend to overlook the value of context-specific arrangements. Teaching arrangement inductively, however, offers an alternative to the standard imitation of text models. Initially pioneered by the Greek rhetorician Isocrates, the inductive method stimulates individual rather than formulaic responses to the problems of organization. Inductively-trained writers also come to see arrangement as a powerful element in persuasive dis course. © 1988, Sage Publications.

It is an accelerated, interdisciplinary program in which a small cohort of stu dents matriculates as an interdependent group throughout their college work. Students begin the program with a five-week communication module that pre pares them to communicate information, coordinate activities, and make deci sions. The module includes five components: intercultural communication, the process and contexts of communication, relationship development and self-disclosure, group communication and team building, and oral communica tion. These components were selected as the most important topics to be covered in a short time frame. Teachers serve largely as coaches or guides, lead ing students through exercises in active and cooperative learning, especially those exercises that build listening skills, the fundamental skills for all commu nication. © 1998, Sage Publications.

Do they concentrate on strategies for improved professional and interpersonal communication skills, or do they direct most attention to purely language issues? These questions have become more important because the number of nonnative English students in business communication classrooms in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and so forth is increasing and because English is becoming more important for business and education in many Asian and African countries. This article outlines some of the language-related problems that occur when teaching nonnative speakers business communication and calls for a drive to address the issue of acceptable language usage in this context.""Developing effective teaching techniques for large classes has become a major concern in today's tight economy. The research study described in this paper shows that large business communications classes can be taught as effectively as smaller ones if the instructor uses “environmental” teaching methods.

What approaches to undergraduate research would enable aspiring technical communicators to develop research skills that would better prepare them for success in a professional environment? Situating the case: The approaches described in this paper draw on the work of Mel Levine as presented in Ready ,or ,Not, Here, Life, Comes} , in which he delineates several reasons why young people encounter problems when they enter professional environments: overly managed lives, no experience of delayed gratification, inability to think critically, limited knowledge of their own strengths and weaknesses, and an expectation of stability in the so-called adult world. Levine claims that these problems can be addressed by helping students develop a sense of inner direction as opposed to direction from without, an understanding of how to think critically and apply knowledge, a willingness to build and refine skills over time, and competent writing and speaking skills. In addition, the approaches described in this paper draw on three well-established research traditions: mixed methods research, problem-based research, and action research. How this case was studied: This paper describes the experiences of using two approaches to teach Research in Technical and Scientific Communication at a mid-sized state university in Virginia. The material was collected informally over a period of six years of teaching the coursethrough observation, student feedback, and completed research reports. About the case: Research in Technical and Scientific Communication required students to produce a research report within the context of real-world inquiry, appropriately focused for a specific audience and purpose, using both primary and secondary sources, and including analysis as well as information. Two approaches were used. The Real Client approach required students to investigate a small-scale, real-world problem or need, which became the focus of a research report that could be submitted to a specific audience for a specific purpose, both identified by the student early in the research process. The Impact of Technology approach required students to consider the impact of technology on modern life, investigate a narrower topic within this broad topic, and prepare a report that could be published in the university magazine or student newspaper. Examples of strong and weak research reports illustrate which features of each approach worked well and which posed challenges. Overall, students responded well to both approaches, but found the Impact of Technology approach more congenial because it was more familiar to them than the Real Client approach. Nonetheless, with both approaches, but especially with the Real Client approach, students seemed reluctant to make necessary contacts, conduct in-depth interviews, and include well-developed analysis. They were more comfortable gathering information anonymously through secondary source material or online surveys, and presenting that information with a limited amount of analysis. Both approaches served to move students toward a more realistic understanding of the kind of research needed in professional environments. Conclusions: These approaches also addressed the concerns raised by Levine. The study was limited by its informal nature, with observations and conclusions resulting from a six-year period of informal experimentation and refinement, during which the requirements for the research report were continually redesigned to better address what students would need to be successful in a workplace. © 2012 IEEE.""This article focuses on the importance of presenting ethics and communication as twin concepts in the management communication class. It underscores the increasing importance and complexity of ethical issues and presents two cases that the instructor can use for analysis and discussion. The cases address two contemporary issues—harassment in the workplace and the consumption of alcohol by pregnant women. Both have implications for business profes sionals and allow students a chance to analyze their views and make decisions about communication strategies. © 1996, Sage Publications.

There is an opportunity for students to engage in both written and oral communication activities; to incorporate individual and group activities; and to involve students in letter, memo, and report writing. And one other important benefit accrues to the student: they get the opportunity to learn much about an area which is becoming increasingly important in the business world-meetings, conferences, and conventions. © 1981, Sage Publications.

This teaching case is based on the task force's deliberations and collaborative efforts to build policy consensus in a sometimes rancorous, high-stakes environment. In it, I reconstruct the story of the shooting that gave rise to the task force, trace the arc of the task force's 104-day existence, and analyze the letter and final report submitted by the task force's co-chairs to (1) demonstrate the highly-pressurized nature of policy language invention and the crucial impact of word choice in such policy, and (2) illustrate the difficulty the task force encountered in attempting to secure consensus and the manner in which the final work product acknowledges, rather than obscures, this struggle. Finally, the case includes recommended readings and a guide for individual and group activities for implementation in either an undergraduate- or graduate-level technical communication course. © 2008 IEEE.""Establishing a course in desktop publishing at the college level is an enterprise that requires important and sometimes difficult choices, such as selecting hardware and software, textbooks, and types of assignments. For faculty members who are involved in making those decisions, the need for information from people who have had experience in teaching desktop publishing is critical. Experience shows that a sound course in this area can be created with these elements: IBM-compatible computers, color monitors, mice, a scanner, one or two laser printers, Aldus PageMaker®, CorelDRAW™, Microsoft® Windows™, Harvard Graphics®, a couple of good textbooks, both practice and original projects, and an emphasis on principles of good design. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

In her letter, she identified Enron' s unethical and illegal financial management practices, but her letter was never made public until the company's stock was all but worthless. This case is based on the Watkins letter, as well as other articles published in the New York Times and Time magazine. First, we identify the context of the Enron scandal. Reviewing the accounting practices that Watkins revealed in her letter. Second, we analyze the Watkins letter, focusing on the rhetorical moves that Watkins makes in the letter and discussing how these moves constitute a persona for Watkins as author. Finally, we present a developed case for use in the classroom; the case continues the analysis of Watkins' persona as it evolves through articles in other publications. We argue that the persona Watkins creates for herself in her letter undergoes a transformation so that by the time she appears as Time magazine's Person of the Year 2002, she is a corporate whistleblower. The case includes a two-day course plan with specified student learning outcomes, teaching resources, a group activity, and a selection of student responses to the case. © 2004 IEEE.""This paper presents a rationale and description for an approach to teaching ethical thinking in a professional writing course. Ethical thinking is a term for teaching ethics as a process rather than a product. The model for this process method is an intermediatElevel technical writing course in which the students carry out a series of related assignments based on the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The SDI provides the basis of a controversy, a highly problematic set of hypothetical and practical assumptions about how to use new military technologies to protect the United States in the event of a nuclear war. By writing and speaking about SDI technologies, students develop the ability to form responsible value judgments in addition to doing factual reporting. To develop their sense of ethical reasoning, they are encouraged to use generalizations that evaluate the subject rather than just describe it. This method of raising ethical awareness could easily be adapted for use in professional seminars for business, government, and industry. © 1989 IEEE""This article focuses on ethical issues in teaching. The author briefly outlines the case of a student who stopped coming to class and writing assignments because of family and financial problems. Ethical considerations are discussed in relation to giving the student a chance to make up for his grades and retain his scholarship. Issues regarding personal and professional ethics are also discussed. According to the author, the concept of the ethical teacher overlaps the concept of a skillful teacher. ""Teaching problem: Students' written assignments show that they tend to list ideas rather than provide evidence-based arguments. This might be because they do not have a framework to base their arguments on. Research question: Does the communication model framework help students to write evidence-based arguments when evaluating the communicative effectiveness in corporate blogs? Situating the case: The ability to engage in argument from evidence is one of the Next Generation Science Standards for scientific and engineering practices. Thus, it is important for engineering students to know how to present evidence-based arguments. The communication model framework was introduced to provide students with a framework to base their arguments on. This framework builds on the genre-based and academic literacies approaches to teaching writing. More companies are now using corporate blogs (an open, participatory, and globally networked social media tool) to engage stakeholders directly across multiple contexts. The framework is useful in analyzing evolving genres like corporate blogs because it is not only structured but also flexible. About the case: This teaching case describes the use of the communication model framework as the basis for students' arguments. The framework was used in a general writing course for engineering students. Working in groups, the students used the framework for their oral practice critique and their critique assignment on a given piece of academic writing or corporate blog. They also had to write a reflection paper individually at the end of the course. Results: Overall, the mixed groups and international students groups made a stronger attempt to apply the framework compared to the Singaporean student groups. The students' educational backgrounds, the group dynamics within the group, and the nature of the discussions affected the level of adoption of the framework in their writing. Conclusions: This teaching case reflects the value of mixed group, face-to-face discussions, and personal reflection in teaching students evidence-based writing, and calls for more research on flexible frameworks as genres evolve. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""In a recent survey, faculty in the College of Business Administration at Georgia State University recorded their perceptions of the effectiveness of both undergraduate and graduate student writing. In general, respondents found students were able to design and present their documents well and to analyze and build common ground with the reader. They were less able to select and organize material, present a plan of action, and express their message clearly. In further comments and follow-up discussions, respondents expressed frustration with their lack of time in class to teach both their areas of expertise and effective writing skills. ""Evaluating written assignments is time consuming, labor-intensive work, and our new faculty work load policy will not encourage the use of written assignments. "" ""Writing is a skill that can be taught and we should be doing it. Unfortunately the move to larger class sizes is a disincentive for faculty to assign more written work."".""Because in days of economic troubles, all areas of science, social science, and industry must account for and justify more closely what they do and what to do, students of technical writing will receive immediate, practical benefit from learning the theory of practice of writing proposals. Proposals are also marvelously versatile for the teacher, because they can be taught in courses of varying length, and to both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups of students. The greatest advantage in teaching them is that through the various parts of a standard proposal, practically every theoretical and/or expository technique used in technical writing can be discussed and practiced. Indeed the proposal can become in itself a minicourse in technical writing, creating yet another possible avenue for work: private consulting.""This article uses the cross-cultural concepts of context and time to examine the rhetoric of German university students in an English business writing course. This participant-observer account, which includes numerous student examples and observations, provides afresh perspective for American teachers in increasingly multinational, multicultural classrooms. It also suggests how Aristotle's concepts of ethos, logos, and pathos together with the case method and group work can help teachers respond to the challenges in such classrooms. The article concludes by suggesting that understanding the rhetoric of culture is an important step in accepting and negotiating cultural differences.""This research article reports the results of an online survey distributed among technical writing instructors in 2006. The survey aimed to examine how we teach intercultural communication in basic technical writing courses: our current practices and methods. The article discusses three major challenges that instructors may face when teaching about intercultural communication. These challenges concern teacher preparation, time and proposed goals and objectives, and teaching materials and methods. This article provides some suggestions for addressing the challenges and enriching a technical writing curriculum.""Instructors of business and technical communication courses continually search for ways to improve their classroom and professional training exercises. Toward that end, this investigation examines two methods of conducting an employment interviewing training exercise for interviewees. Specifically, instructor-facilitated and peer-facilitated interviewing exercises are compared. Data collected from interviewing classes show that students preferred the instructor-facilitated over the peer-facilitated training exercise. Advantages and disadvantages of the instructor-facilitated exercise are discussed, and suggestions for further examination are offered. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

This article discusses how scenes from popular television series such as Everybody Loves Raymond, Friends, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show can be used to teach effective job interview skills in business communication courses. Television episodes may be used to examine in detail topics commonly covered in textbook discussions of job interviewing, such as attire, behavior, and interview questions; they may also be used to explore topics not typically addressed, such as gender issues and involvement of family members. The use of appropriate television scenes can enhance the job interviewing unit by attracting the students' attention and generating productive class discussion.

Listening to a lecture is different from participating in a conversation in important ways. This paper identifies key features of lectures, discusses existing research on lecture comprehension and note-taking, and presents a course designed to teach non-native English speaking college students lecture comprehension strategies and note-taking techniques. Nine listening strategies and eight note-taking techniques, focusing on both macro- and micro-markers in lecture discourse, are introduced. These strategies and techniques are progressively taught and accompanied by specially designed listening tasks. Improved student performance is shown by a t-test comparing the pre-test and the post-test scores. Finally, suggestions are made to native English speaking lecturers regarding how they may adapt their lecturing styles and methods of presentation to help non-native audiences cope with lectures successfully. © 1993 IEEE""This paper provides an overview of the issues involved in providing listening instruction to those who work or who are preparing to work in organizations.

Communicative methods used to teach English as a Second Language (ESL), such as collaborative learning, dialogue journals, peer review, and oral presentations, can be adapted readily to teaching analytical and communication skills to native and nonnative speakers of English. ESL strategies work well to enable learners to analyze readings and form and communicate well-developed opinions in the context of case studies and media critiques used in business communication. © 1996 By the Association for Business Communication.""Students asked to solve open-ended technical problems in the technical communication class sharpen their problem-solving strategies at the same time they improve their communication abilities. The writing process is a key tool in the students' attempts to produce effective and persuasive problem solutions. Too often, students fail to use writing to help solve problems because they are accustomed to working with fully defined and closed academic problems that have single, context-free solutions. Only through attempting to solve open and undefined professional problems do they have to bring their full problem-solving skills to bear.""The teaching of professional communication must reflect the realities of the Information Age if our courses are to adequately prepare students for a work place that is being radically transformed by communication technology. Professional-communication instruction must reflect such changes as exces sive information, meaning lag, the conceptual nature of work in an informa tion society, the inextricable meshing of computers and communication, and the reality of global communications. Professional-communication theory must reflect the problem of excessive information. Audience analysis must take into account the realities imposed by computer conferencing and elec tronic mail. Assignments must teach students to transform raw data into in formation and then into communication for readers with various information requirements. The use of computers in writing instruction must be reexam ined to insure that the computer as a communication tool is effectively integrated. International-communication strategies and protocols must be stud ied. Dictation instruction must be included. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Writing teachers frequently use scenarios for that purpose. In this article, the author introduces the unified case method as an improvement on the traditional case method and reports on the use of this rhetorical method in a professional writing class. Specifically, the author used a single, complex scenario throughout the semester so that all the writing assignments were situated in the same fictional world. The students reacted enthusiastically to the method, and their writing was more successful. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

To meet their needs, U.S. professional communication faculty are designing short courses that can be delivered abroad during between-term periods and that foster an understanding of the situations and genres of the field within a context of cultural dislocation. Based on the courses described in this article, the best approach is to settle students in one location rather than touring; keep student numbers low by an entrepreneurial approach to keeping costs low; encourage students to live as the locals do, in apartments rather than hotels; explicitly plan appropriate access to technology; use class time to provide structure and reflection, but allow free time for collateral learning; and make sure the course grows local roots.""Our assessment research suggests that quantitative business courses that rely primarily on algorithmic problem solving may not produce the deep learning required for addressing real-world business problems. This article illustrates a strategy, supported by recent learning theory, for promoting deep learning by moving students gradually from “well-structured” algorithmic problems with single correct answers to “ill-structured” real-world business problems that may have multiple correct answers and require an argument addressed to a specific audience. We show how these scaffolded communication assignments promote deep learning, and suggest ways that interested faculty can adapt the assignments to their own courses. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""After first establishing the process of planning and writing reports, reversing the usual order of presentation of the concepts of gathering information, interpreting information, and organizing information allows students to focus their efforts more specifically on each task and to experience completing the entire reporting process in several forms. Each time the process is completed, report writing students draw one step closer to being better report writers and better report presenters. © 1986, Sage Publications.

This research analyzes the effectiveness of multiple classroom assignments for teaching soft skills in a Business Communication course. Five distinct pedagogical strategies were used in an effort to teach soft skills, including a self-analysis, an interview, a guest lecturer, a journal article, and a soft skills video. Results offer insights into students’ perceptions of the most helpful pedagogical approaches for teaching soft skills. © 2016 by the Association for Business Communication Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.""The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of 'layers of abstraction' guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Business commmtmication often has significant legal consequences. Students thus need to learn how to avoid legal liability in their writing.

Students should understand that e-mail messages have a unique place in the communications continuum and, therefore, their own rules. While the format of an e-mail message may resem ble that of a memo, each element presents special requirements in an elec tronic medium. The interactivity of e-mail offers both opportunities and constraints to writers and readers. A special etiquette also applies to e-mail, especially the need to avoid flaming and spamming and to check e-mail often. While writers often think their office e-mail is private, employers who own the systems have been upheld legally in their right to monitor e-mail for business reasons, and thus students should pay careful attention to the content and tone of their messages. Assigning e-mail projects in class helps students prepare for this important communications medium, work effectively in teams, and corre spond with corporations as part of their classroom research. © 1998, Sage Publications.

Only when the ecology is right can the meeting work. To address that ecology explicitly, instructors should help students assess their prior experience in small groups. In a classroom exercise, student teams answer one of a set of questions about meetings: 1. How participants know when a meeting is productive (or not); 2. How they know when warm hospitality has been extended (or not); 3. What happens before, during, and after meetings that generates broad enthusiasm-or produces apathy. A class period spent on such discussion helps convince students of the need to proactively apply effective meeting management principles in their own workplace.""Although most technical communication pedagogy provides students with solid advice on how to visualize particular numerical representations, it underproblematizes the rhetorical decisions we make in choosing which numbers to display in the first place. This pedagogical reflection uses Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s concept of interpretative level to foreground the rhetorical choices that underlie our decisions on how to summarize, aggregate, and synthesize the data we visualize. It then describes two informal classroom activities that emphasize the importance of interpretative level and help students see the recursive nature of data visualization and invention. © The Author(s) 2015""Business educators recognize the importance of developing teamwork as an employability skill. However, current methods used to teach teamwork have been met with mixed results from both students and educators. This article integrates research on the importance of teamwork, team development processes, and coteaching through examining a case study wherein coteaching was used as a means of conveying teamwork concepts to students. Coteaching is an alternate approach to teaching teamwork skills. In this case, the core competencies of shared values, complementary expertise, and the willingness to experiment were critical to forming and developing a functional teaching partnership. © The Author(s) 2013.""MA students in professional writing and editing researched technical writing in specific workplace cultures. Their research is interpreted in light of recent theory on authorship as a cultural rather than individual phenomenon. Students' constructs for understanding their own writerly selves are discussed, as are constructs that emerged for the interpretations of selves and others in workplace cultures. Teaching technical authorship meant addressing such constructs, implicating issues of status, affect and effect, representation, and expertise. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

They begin simply, by completing job application forms, personal resumes, and letters of application, tasks which require concise expression of facts, which reveal much about the students' backgrounds, and which they must use to get a job. Then they move to the daily writing problems an engineer faces. In every class they also practice exercises that correct the many errors caused by the change from their native language into English."The nature of proper preparatory training is discussed with specific reference to the language groups American trainers are likely to encounter working in the U. S. or abroad. The justification for specific practices is discussed and should enable instructors to develop further strategies for training.This paper describes the problem of teaching technical writing to engineering students who are convinced they will never need or use the skills. A possible solution to the problem is to use the case method. The case method changes the nature of the traditional classroom environment by reflecting life on the ″outside.″ This paper describes how the case method is used in one technical writing course and how it changed some students' minds about the importance of a technical writing course in helping them prepare for their professional careers. The ten-week syllabus is described and samples of ″before″ and ″after″ are offered."Can technical writing still be taught credibly by teachers with only academic experience? This article draws a distinction between courses designed for students expecting to be full-time technical communicators and general-purpose service courses designed for students in a variety of fields. The article then argues that teachers of service courses can teach credibly without having worked as writers in nonacademic workplaces if they fulfill these conditions: they should have a critical command of research into nonacademic writing, rhetorical theory, and reading theory; they should define technical writing broadly enough to see themselves as technical writers; they should seek and take advantage of everyday opportunities to practice technical writing and reading; and they should carefully consider the sense in which their courses reflect reality.""What constitutes a cause is a particularly important question for those who teach or study technical writing. This article describes a case that helps students look beyond the technical ""causes"" of a commuter airplane crash in order to address the complex web of policies, practices, actions, and events that contributed to the crash. Using an approach grounded in stakeholder theory and ethical theory, students use real documents ranging from news accounts to Federal Aviation Administration policies to National Transit Safety Board hearing exhibits to identify systemic problems that contributed to the disaster. Working from particular stakeholder perspectives, they work collaboratively to develop and argue for policy changes that will help prevent future tragedies. The abundance of real documents that drive this case make it an especially useful tool for engaging students in difficult-to-teach subject matter, including the role of writing in the failure of technical systems, deliberative and judicial rhetoric, stakeholder theory, visual rhetoric, and ethics. © 2004 IEEE.""In order to reproduce the politically charged environment of most corporations, I turn my class into a company. Using previously designated study groups, I make one the presi dent, another the vice president, and a final one the man ager of operations. Then I give them a problem which they can handle only through memos. Outside of class, they communicate by fax machines. Inside of class, they read and discuss each other's memos.

Creating complete and creative communications begins with a disciplined process of discovery - identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and integrating the articulated and embedded purposes. Expanding on the work of Linda Flower and John Hayes, this article first explores a means to promote a thorough examination of purpose. It then provides tools for capturing and integrating these insights into communications that are complete, capable of satisfying the rhetorical challenges, and compelling reflections of the student's creative problem solving abilities.""The authors describe two pedagogical strategiesa-rhetorical sentence combining and rhetorical pattern practicea-that blend once-popular teaching techniques with rhetorical decision making. A literature review identified studies that associated linguistic and rhetorical knowledge with success in engineering writing; this information was used to create exercises teaching technical communication students to write Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRaD) reports. Two pilot studies report promising results: Preliminary findings suggest that students who were taught this method wrote essays that were perceived as significantly higher in quality than those written by students in a control section. At the same time, however, the pilot studies point to some challenges and shortcomings of exercise-oriented pedagogies. © 2011 SAGE Publications.""Outlines a professional writing course based on a proposal format that ties the classroom to the student's world Suggests teaching document forms such as memos, letters, and reports in the context of a comprehensive proposal format""This case study focuses on the role of language in managing organizational change. We examined the campaign and rhetorical strategies used by a major US airline to persuade customer service employees not to vote for Teamsters Union representation. The company's anti-union campaign documents included internal memos, letters, and emails. If included in a professional or technical communication course, these documents provide a powerful case for students to explore the role of written communication within a changing organization.

Result: greater comfort with their growing vocabularies and increased enthusiasm for language study.""A review of the research on methods of teaching writing yields several implications for teachers of technical writing: they should emphasize the writing process rather than the product, create a positive atmosphere, and assign both pre- and post-writing activities.""The ability to write well is more than just a neutral technique to be used for good or bad purposes. As Hobbes says, “eloquence persuades because it is seeming prudence”, the effectiveness of a communication comes from its apparently embodying practical reasoning. Consequently, learning how to write well is an opportunity to leam how to deliberate, how to bring principles and concrete facts to bear on a situation that requires decision and action. learning to write well is the acquisition of equipment without which the moral life is incomplete. © 1985, Sage Publications.

And since engineering students will take up technical matters in their careers, it seems only natural that a writing class will require them to write papers about technology, that is, to practice technical writing. While this approach may indeed be of value, the following article presents an alternative to the teaching of technical writing per se. The author suggests that if students learn how to approach an issue they care about, form an arguable idea from this issue, then logically prove it in subsequent paragraphs, that this deep level of writing and thinking comprehension can then be used to enhance any piece of writing, especially the technical document.""A successful way of organizing a large publications group is described.

Intersecting five fundamental group attributes (group size, group goal, group member interdependence, group structure, and group identity) with three overarching group processes (leadership, decision making, and conflict management) creates an analytical tool for the examination of team interaction. Furthermore, each group attribute/group process intersection encourages analytical questions targeting assumptions, values, and ethical positions embedded within the group. One advantage of this heuristic device is that it weds team member behaviors with the values members espouse and enact during team interactions. Pedagogical considerations are also discussed. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Group class exercises have the potential to provide important lessons for students. However, in completing these exercises, business students may not be getting all of the benefits from group work that a team experience could provide. The challenge to business educators is to provide a meaningful team experience within the limitations presented by the class environment. This article describes organizational communication and marketing classes that applied team formation and team-building exercises to enrich the team experience and differentiate it from typical group work.""Virtual teams face challenges arising from geographical distance, cultural differences, and differing modes of interaction. Team leaders in particular face these challenges because they are primarily responsible for efficient team management. Technology choices made by leaders have become a focus of interest in communication studies, but questions regarding media choice in virtual teams have not been widely studied. This article describes an in-depth, ethnographic exploration of Finnish virtual team leaders who work in natural teams in organizational contexts. The principal goal was to examine their choice of communication technologies in daily work. The results indicate that the choice was based on four factors. First, there are two factors that are person-related: ACCESSIBILITY and SOCIAL DISTANCE. Accessibility refers to people's ease of access through a particular medium, and social distance suggests that the technology selection is based on the social distance between the persons involved. Second, there are two task-related factors: idea sharing and informing. These factors describe team leaders' media selection by the nature of the task at hand. The findings suggest that team leaders' technology choice can be partly explained by traditional media selection theories, but in virtual contexts, accessibility becomes an important determinant of which technology is chosen. © 2006 IEEE.""Although past research has focused on the individuala's ability to listen and on the broader concept of communication satisfaction, limited attention has been devoted to the listening environment. This article develops the construct and measurement of a new scale, Team Listening Environment (TLE). Team listening environment is defined as the individuala's perception of behaviors demonstrating genuine attention and understanding by team members. This article investigates the individual perception of the listening environment within a variety of academic and professional contexts. Three studies were conducted for rigorous analysis of this latent construct using confirmatory factor analysis in the structural equation modeling function of EQS 6.1. Results suggest that TLE is a valid construct and a contributor to workplace commitment. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The transfer of knowledge is often blocked by language barriers. In overcoming these barriers, machine translation can compete with translators neither in quality nor in flexibility.

We report results from a survey of distributed team members conducted within a large, multinational technology manufacturing organization. Survey responses indicate that compared to members of larger teams, members of smaller teams participated more actively on their team, were more committed to their team, were more aware of the goals of the team, had greater awareness of other team members, and were in teams with higher levels of rapport. Larger teams are more conscientious than smaller teams in preparing meeting agendas. Team size was also associated with different technology choice: Larger teams adopted technology to support the coordination of asynchronous work, while smaller teams adopted technology that primarily supported collaboration. We discuss the implications of distributed team size for team performance and technology adoption. © 2005 IEEE.""definite advantages to help accomplish teaching excellence in your communication-related courses.

Like the fiction writer, the engineer and the scientist must realize that writing is a creative process rather than a reflex action if they are to communicate successfully. Often, professional advancement depends on the ability to present and to interpret factual information coherently and effectively. Although technical writing presents factual information and creative writing fictional information, both crafts adhere to the same underlying rhetorical principles in order to create their desired effects. This article examines those shared principles that make technical writing more than a prosaic exercise and allow writers to express themselves meaningfully. The role of imagination in this craft is also explored. Besides the references, two other articles on communication by this author are listed.""Simulating the professional setting in the classroom is important but difficult, since the two situations are worlds apart. Nonetheless, students can learn the fundamentals of project leadership, team writing, and production of a major document if the teacher plans and structures the assignments for the project leader so that the project leader and student writers share the same understanding of the document, know the lines of authority for decisions, and see how individual parts fit into the whole.

The resulting reevaluation of the technical guidelines, the development of emergency management policies necessary to postearthquake recovery, and the implications of these developments for professional communication are discussed.""Linda Flower's work serves as the basis for devising writing technical assistance in three case studies of multiauthor reports. One major barrier to audience-based writing, planning - and hence, producing readable text - is the writer-based structure embodied in a project's work program.

Analysis of patient histories and surveys completed by the participating physicians after each use of the computer conferencing system as well as interviews and observations indicate that the FAHC consulting trauma specialists and the remotely located physicians felt the linkups do not interfere with standard ER procedures, that communication was at least adequate for all consultations, and that the consults improved the quality of care, for over half of the cases. Furthermore, interviews with rural ER physicians indicated that they saw the program operating as the first stage of FAHC's management of a patient to be transferred to that facility.""Along with China’s rapid development in science and economy, technical communication between Chinese and Westerners is becoming more and more important. The purpose of this study is to promote the teaching of technical communication in China by introducing it into China’s college English for specific purposes. Postgraduate classes from grades 2001 to 2004 at Capital University of Medical Sciences in Beijing were assigned to study English for Technical Communication, a course that integrated the concepts of technical communication into English for specific purposes. In the survey of Grade 2004, over 96% of the graduates claimed that it was necessary for them to study English for Technical Communication; more than 90% of the students confirmed that the course was practical; and 90% of them claimed that the course had significantly improved their abilities in technical communication. Therefore, introducing technical communication in English for specific purposes would be a feasible way to develop the teaching of technical communication in China.""This article proposes a postmodern reconceptualization of technical communication pedagogy to make student and professional agency a major concern, especially because technical communicators must compete in a global economy that rewards flexibility and penalizes inflexibility.

Method: We analyzed 502 user experience job postings from Monster.com. After mining the postings for position title, job type, education level, experience level, location, salary, and industry sector, we conducted a content analysis of the job descriptions, using open coding to identify professional competencies and personal characteristics that employers are seeking in applicants, as well as key technologies and information products. Results: The user experience job postings could be grouped into five categories— Designer, Developer, Architect, Manager, Researcher—each with a distinct profile in terms of information products, technology skills, and professional competencies. However, the job postings also reflected skills, competencies, and characteristics that were common across job categories, and several of these are areas that overlap with more traditional technical communication positions. Conclusion: We articulate the advantages and challenges of transitioning into UX and make recommendations to help technical communication practitioners and programs capitalize on the advantages and address the challenges. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

The author also describes a unique system of subject headings developed for the International Nuclear Information System. The uniqueness of this subject indexing system is that it is based on descriptors chosen for Boolean search by computer; however, the descriptors and the title (which is already in the data base as a result of previous descriptive cataloging input) are arranged by the computer to prepare a meaningful printed subject index."Observes that future human-computer relations may not require the reading of manuals or manipulation of the interface  Maintains that technical communicators will continue to enable users because they know how people want to learn from machines."Women decide on about 80% of the goods that their household buys. But marketers often sell products, especially technical ones, that are designed by men and therefore are oriented largely toward their needs. Consequently, assembly instructions for these products are also oriented toward men’s needs.

Central to the discussion is a description of the integration of courses in spoken and written communication at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. Specialists in technical communication in industry were consulted with the result that an existing degree course was adapted to meet the industrial challenge."Technical communication is changing due to the prominence of the Internet and related technologies. This article reports the results of a qualitative study of how technical communicators are using the Internet. The study was conducted using surveys, phone interviews, and focus groups. Respondents indicated that the Internet plays a significant role in the work practices of technical communicators. On the positive side, communicators find the Internet helpful for contacting customers, obtaining updated technical information, and publishing online documentation. On the negative side, communicators encounter company resistance and are frustrated with issues of company security and the lack of order for accessing Internet information. These features present new opportunities and challenges for the profession, including issues of training, interface design, working within other departments, and entirely new job titles and positions.""Technical communicators can and should play an important role in the development of information systems to improve the usability of the systems. Besides writing user guides and training material, technical communicators can engage in four other tasks to add value to information systems development: acting as user advocate, writing online help, writing system and error messages, and providing advice on interface design. We assert that technical communicators' involvement in systems development should not be tied to a particular development methodology. Instead, they should be associated with four general tasks in systems development: system investigation, analysis, design, and implementation. We then discuss some notable human factors and their impacts on the tasks performed by technical communicators. Three cognitive mapping techniques - causal mapping, semantic mapping, and concept mapping - are introduced as a means to elicit an individual's belief system regarding a problem domain. These cognitive mapping techniques have great potential for overcoming some behavioral and cognitive problems as well as facilitating understanding among stakeholders in the development of information systems. We discuss how technical communicators can apply various cognitive mapping techniques to improve the usability of the resulting information systems. The use of these techniques is illustrated using a case study. © 2005 IEEE.""The ongoing implementation of the tenets of Executive Order (EO) 13166 is helping change the focus of localization and writing for translation for technical communicators. In this article, I will discuss EO 13166; its impact on hospitals, clinics, and limited English proficient (LEP) populations; and how technical communicators involved in translation and localization help medical professionals comply with the law. I will provide best practice strategies for localization practices in the health care industry worldwide. Method: This article employs a literature review of government documentation for Executive Order 13166, as well as hospital and clinic reports of current localization practices designed to increase compliance with EO 13166. Results: The review of current practices indicates that much work remains to be done by technical communicators to help hospitals and clinics comply with EO 13166, especially in the areas of visual icons and other localization efforts. Conclusion: The best strategies for localizing health care information include the following: 1. Make the textual style of the information match that of the culture's expectations. 2. Research the preferences for graphics and color in medical documents for the target culture and use the preferred style in the documentation. 3. Use widely recognized symbols. 4. Use focus groups to test the localization strategy with representatives of the target culture. 5. Consider the content of the documentation when localizing, not just the style and format.""This paper posits that the technical communicator probably spends more time engaged in oral communication activity than he does in written; thus, to be an effective technical communicator one needs an appreciation and an understanding of both modes. Differences between oral and written communication, and methods of difference reduction, are discussed.""This article reports a study of internship requirements in technical communication programs compared with three established professions and one emerging profession that have certification or licensing requirements for practitioners. The study addresses three questions about technical communication internship programs: 1) Are internships offered as a way to fulfill program academic credit requirements? 2) If internships are offered, are they required or elective? 3) What are the minimum/maximum academic credits allowed for internships toward fulfillment of program requirements and the number of workplace hours of internship required? To answer these questions we focused on three elements of internship program management: academic credits, workplace hours per academic credit, and total workplace hours required. Our findings indicate that there is considerable disparity for these factors among programs in our field and that we lack criteria similar to those used in established professions for internships.""Almost all IT, engineering research, financial analysis, and manufacturing industries are confronted with a question: to outsource or not? The outsourcing and offshoring trend is inspired by success stories of huge cost savings, decreased time-to-market, and better quality. Simultaneously, outsourcing-gone-bad stories highlight how hidden costs exceed benefits, cross-cultural problems impact quality, and intellectual property risks shadow project lifecycles. Managers in companies are presented with a confusing picture for which there are no easy answers. Companies, vendors, and policymakers need a framework to understand the outsourcing phenomenon and plan implementation strategies for outsourced projects. At present, many companies go with the gut based on the experience of others and media reports. But very rarely are two technical documentation tasks alike and never are the concerns of two technical communication tasks the same. This tutorial presents the Twelve Driver Framework and the Driver-Model Percentage Matrix to assess the benefits and risks of outsourcing a technical communication task. In the end, qualitative decision-making will determine an organization's decision about outsourcing, but the use of such a framework and related metrics will greatly enhance the quality of the final choice. © 2007 IEEE.""As part of Phase 4 of the NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project, studies were conducted that investigated the technical communications practices of Dutch and U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists. The studies had the following objectives: (1) to solicit the opinions of aerospace engineers and scientists regarding the importance of technical communication to their professions, (2) to determine the use and production of technical communication by aerospace engineers and scientists, (3) to investigate their use of libraries and technical information centers, (4) to investigate their use of and the importance to them of computer and information technology, (5) to examine their use of electronic networks, and (6) to determine their use of foreign and domestically produced technical reports. Self-administered (mail) questionnaires were distributed to Dutch aerospace engineers and scientists at the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) in the Netherlands, the NASA Ames Research Center in the U.S., and the NASA Langley Research Center in the U.S. Responses of the Dutch and U.S. participants to selected questions are presented in this paper. © 1994 IEEE.""This article informs practitioners of the types of interactions that their peers prefer to have with technical communication students and of ways that those interactions can be arranged to the benefit of all parties. Method: I conducted a survey of STC members regarding interactions between practitioners and students. A total of 480 practitioners responded. I analyzed and presented the responses. Results: Practitioners are interested in and experienced at interacting with students in both company-sponsored activities, such as internships, and personally initiated activities, such as mentoring and part-time teaching. Practitioners acknowledge that students and employers benefit from these and other kinds of activities. Conclusion: Practitioners can interact with students in ways that help the students and that honor the interests and time constraints of the practitioners. Practitioners and academics can initiate activities that bring practitioners and technical communication students together.""This article explores the boundaries of technical communication as knowledge work in the emerging era of social media. Analyzing the results of an annual survey offered each year from 2008 until 2011, the study reports on how knowledge workers use publicly available online services to support their work. The study proposes a distinction between sites and services when studying social media in knowledge work and concludes with an exploration of implications for technical communication pedagogy. © 2014 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Recent changes in health care in the US have made it important for health information to become easier to access, understand, and use. Making medical decisions without adequate information can lead to poor health outcomes. Providers are being incentivized to improve the quality and value of patient-centered communication and care. Technical communication practitioners can collaborate with interdisciplinary professionals to help these initiatives succeed. Method: A patient education software application was developed with an interdisciplinary collaboration between a medical animation company, a surgery clinic, and an academic researcher who is also a technical communication practitioner. User-centered design principles were employed in the development of the application. Interviews were conducted to reveal insights about the application’s influence on the language participants used to discuss the procedure. Results: Participants who used the software application to learn about the procedure were able to consistently recognize and recall more informational and procedural knowledge than participants who did not use the application. Conclusion: Collaborations similar to this can enhance the design, creation, development, and assessment of technical communication materials in patient education settings to help improve the odds that patients will understand more about their health and be able to make better decisions and can contribute valuable information to the technical communication curriculum. Best practices in technical communication can inform user-centered design, development, and assessment of educational materials in a variety of settings. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

They need to know: 1) which systems are available; 2) how to begin to use them; and 3) how to apply them to their specific work. A method for analyzing the needs of new computer users is discussed. Specific vehicles for communicating computing information are described, including newsletters, online and offline documentation, training courses, and demonstrations.""Single sourcing through a content management system (CMS) is altering technical communication practices in many organizations, including institutions of higher education. Open source software (OSS) solutions are currently among the most popular content management platforms adopted by colleges and universities in the United States and abroad. The GPL license, ease of use, customizability, and the large, global user base of mature content management systems are among the reasons these organizations choose OSS to meet their CMS needs. This article reviews the literature on the effects of single sourcing on technical communication practice. It also explores issues of OSS adoption, both generally and in international contexts. Through a case study of an OSS CMS implementation at a mid-sized public college, the article examines important contributions technical communicators can make to the rollout of an OSS-based CMS. © 2011 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc."An overview is given on less formal approaches to implementing cross-functional teams in software development environments. It is shown that technical communicators are ideal candidates for initiating cross-functional approaches in their organizations.Maintains that effective technical communicators are aware of and have assessed the risk of digital writing Argues that technical communicators should be responsible for their language in digital writing spaces that blend the public and personal."Examines the roles technical communicators play in designing and developing information systems, including online help  Demonstrates that the usability of online help is affected by who writes it.""This case study examines the implementation of an early single-source (the reuse across documents and projects of content stored in a database) content-management system among technical communicators and how they influenced the decision to adopt the technology. Research questions: (1) Why was a component content-management system developed and what was the process of its implementation? (2) How did technical communicators, functioning as both adopters and change agents, influence the new system's adoption? What affected their perceptions of agency during the implementation? Situating the case: Diffusion of Innovations Theory defines innovation adoption as a communication process that occurs over time. When participating as change agents in innovation diffusion, technical communicators are uniquely qualified to support technological change because they are skilled in making technologies accessible to users. Technical communicators can also be the recipients of change, particularly when organizations adopt new technologies, such as content-management systems. Given their expertise at the interface of technology and its users, technical communicators are well positioned to impact the adoption of content-management systems. Methodology: A single, retrospective instrumental case design examined the early 2000s' implementation of a single-source content-management system in the technical communication group of a global company. Surveys, interviews, and document analysis were used to examine the case over a six-year period About the case: A single-source system was adopted to contain costly increases in document cycle time resulting from: (1) customized production of complex and varied products and (2) new European Union regulations requiring all product documentation written in the national language at the point of sale. The system stored product information in a central repository as numbered modules that could be reused in future deliverables. Doing so brought greater continuity to authoring, translation, and publication of content. The system eliminated retranslation of information and automatically recorded and applied any subsequent changes to all affected documents. Technical communicators functioned as change agents and adopters during the system's implementation. Technical communicators in the organization had the choice to adopt the system, and adoption rates varied among staff members. Despite preparation for possible resistance, several staff initially rejected the new system. Those who adopted it did so quickly and created a shared meaning about the system with change agents, a meaning not shared with resistors. The decision of whether to adopt was influenced by perceptions of the innovation and of agency (positive and negative) about the change agents. Conclusions: A pro-innovation bias can impede the creation of shared meaning between change agents and adopters. Emphasizing technical knowledge about the innovation over persuasive elements of empathy for the uncertainty it produces and identity of what it means to be a writer can also stifle adoption. As change agents, technical communicators influence adoption through their rhetorical understanding of situation and capacity for establishing contexts that allow for the construction of shared meaning between change agents and potential adopters. Also, a perceived lack of decisive leadership or a champion for the change risks restricting the power of change agents to influence adoption and can create a space for protracted resistance to it. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Advances in technology have caused great change in the workplace, including changes in the relationships among managers and employees. Workers and managers alike require education and training to work effectively in the new ""informated"" environment, an environment in which computers can be used not only to automate work processes, but also to provide vast quantities of information about processes, products, and people.""In this article I argue that technical communicators are in the position to foster users' commonsense understanding of products. The notion that technical communicators can increase the common sense of users is absent in the field of technical communication literature. Reasons for not recognizing the legitimacy of common sense range from its unexamined nature to a belief that it cannot be taught. After discussing different definitions of common sense, I suggest that including scenarios, common metaphors, and language that promotes procedural knowledge in product information can strengthen users' commonsense understanding of the products they use. Moreover, in failing to make use of commonsense appeals, technical communicators are ignoring a sound persuasive strategy.""This article presents an overview of how the internet has changed the way employers advertise vacancies and the way technical communicators search and apply for these openings. First, I explore the evolution of how employers have used the internet as a tool for identifying the best candidate for the job. Next, I review seven specific online recruiting strategies used by employers today. Finally, I describe major mistakes made by online job seekers and offer advice on how best to avoid or minimize these blunders. Included is a list of useful job search resources for technical communicators.""Information is the stock in trade for all technical communicators, yet the concept of information as it applies to technical communication has not been well defined. This article presents an understanding of information that, it is hoped, will promote the development of a unified, theoretical base for the practice of technical communication. The concept of information is examined from the perspectives of mathematics, engineering, biology, and human behavior. Characteristics of information common to all information systems are brought forward to a key understanding - that information is inextricably linked with behavior. It follows that the first step in designing an information product is to state its purpose in terms of a desired behavioral outcome. Measuring behavior then becomes the most significant measure of an information product's quality.""Technical graphics originated with the simple need for instructional drawings, but has expanded to include a large variety of applications, materials, processes, and techniques. Engineers and scientists who must frequently communicate complex technical concepts should have a sufficient knowledge of the various types of artwork and methods of preparation that they can plan, direct, and participate in preparing their technical graphics. The types of technical publications produced by most technical organizations are described; guidance toward planning their illustrative content is offered; and a number of sources for visual information are suggested.""Compares technical editing processes to software testing processes Describes content editing activities in the context of comprehensive editing, usability editing, and copy editing""Because of the changing nature of today's corporations and their distributive information systems, editors are in the right place and time to influence the development and management of Web-based publishing systems within their companies. Technical editors possess unique skills that could be adapted for editing and administering intranets - company-wide information publishing systems relying on Internet technology. This article encourages editors to take an active role in developing intranet systems at their companies and suggests strategies for doing so. Editors will benefit from the discussion of the importance of intranet ""publishing"" in today's changing business climate.""Now that intranets have become the new model for information technology systems, we can expect that more organizations will adopt online document review and editing procedures. This may be problematic for technical editors. Survey studies published in 1992 and 1995 found that most technical editors were still editing on paper most of the time even though an overwhelming percentage of them had access to computers and expressed a positive attitude toward using computers for editing-related tasks. In this article I review discussions of online editing in the technical communication literature to understand how online editing has been constructed within the discipline and why many technical editors remain loyal to traditional paper-based procedures. I discuss a recent call for emulating handwritten mark-up and author queries electronically and compare this ""technical fix"" with the collaborative online editing affordances of the latest word processors. I then discuss studies of online reading and composition whose results suggest that the materiality of hard-copy editing procedures may contribute to some inherent advantages over online emulations of such procedures, or at least foster the widespread perception that certain advantages exist for hard-copy editing. I conclude by urging an open-minded and flexible but also critical perspective toward online editing technology. Such a perspective should help make the move to online editing a more positive experience for technical editors. It might also help them define a higher-level role for editing in the information and document development process.""What do editors think about the field of technical editing? What is the typical organizational context for this work? How are editors viewed by the people who manage them? Has technical editing changed? Will it change? These and similar topics were covered in a recent questionnaire answered by more than 60 technical editors and managers. This article summarizes and illustrates the viewpoints, judgment, and misgivings they expressed. For the purposes of this article, this informal definition will serve: Technical editing is taking a manuscript that presents factual or conceptual material about specialized subject matter, and doing whatever is necessry to prepare that manuscript for effective communication with the intended audience.""In 1989 a bipartisan group of US congressmen attempted to use high-definition television (HDTV) as a vehicle to redirect government policy toward the consumer electronics industry. The authors explore why that effort ultimately failed. It is noted that important technical issues were rarely reflected accurately in the public policy debate. In spite of efforts by the IEEE, engineers were largely absent from the debate and failed to influence it. Technical arguments were carried on primarily by those who did not understand the technical issues involved or who distorted them to fit an established political philosophy. How technical information about HDTV was used by the participants, and how political factors set the terms by which technical information could or could not be presented are examined. How engineers might have made a more effective technical case for HDTV is considered.""Rapid advancement in communication technology has brought with it a host of relevant questions. This special issue looks at some interactions of culture, communication behaviours, and multimedia technology.""Most technical writing textbook assignments are artificial. They do not force students to deal with writing problems in the same way they will be called on to deal with them in the workplace. Technical writing instructors can provide their students with realistic writing alternatives. Alternatives for two assignments that are almost always artificial—writing instructions and definition—and the benefits of these a alternatives are discussed. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

The journals' functions in communicating information, recording achievements, and enhancing peer recognition are well known. Perhaps less well understood, and certainly less well employed, is the fact that journals canbe used by managers as a tool to measure the merit of the work being done. This paper discusses, from the point of view of technical management, specific points that make papers prepared for publication in professional journals useful for appraising the quality of work being done in the laboratory.""The importance of layout is stressed in preparation of technical manuals. Although it is best to have no fixed rules for layout, the author proposes several guidelines, such as side-by-side arrangement of copy and illustrations and use of horizontal lines for bringing order to a page.""The case history is presented of the planning of a successful technical publicity and public relations program to promote increased sales of a mature product line with stable market. Attention is given to the approach to: uncover problems which seem to block increased sales; Identify opportunities for communicating with specifying/buying influences and determine communications, news and technical or marketing information that editors, meeting program chairmen, etc. would feel is worth communicating to their readers or members.""Starting with the premise that there are two different ways of viewing readers, as empirical subjects and as rhetorical participants, this paper presents a taxonomy of roles that readers play within technical documents. Even though these roles are shaped by distinct, often contradictory theoretical traditions, they take on an independent existence during the reading process. Actual readers can assume a variety of roles, depending on the nature of the document and the willingness of each particular reader. Further, this paper argues, this taxonomy is not complete, but subject to changes and additions as new technologies are developed requiring new roles to be played. Researchers and teachers should encourage this more fluid view of audience in usability testing labs and classroom settings. © 1992 IEEE""Colleges are offering various kinds of speech courses to engineering students, but it is not clear whether these courses are fulfilling the needs of technical people. The ability to talk about technical matters is important to the average engineer who may present and disseminate as much technical information orally as graphically. If a college course in technical writing can be justified, then certainly a course in technical speech (presenting technical information to various audiences) can be justified. Courses in technical speech might be improved if teachers knew more about how technical speech differs from other kinds of speech, and more about the requirements for successful technical speaking.""When technical students begin their professional careers, they are not always adequately prepared for the complex communication demands that will be made of them—especially during the process of developing a technical proposal. A realworld investigation of technical proposal development is an excellent way for the technical writing course, often constrained by time and standard writing assignments, to prepare students to meet these demands. The investigations include practice in collaborating, planning and schedulling, and oral reporting. © 1994 IEEE.""Steps can be taken by a speaker to improve his presentation of a technical topic to a lay audience and make the subject more understandable to the listener. These steps stress the use of (1) much advance preparation, (2) informative exercises, entertaining stories, and simple drawings, (3) examples picked to fit the audience, and (4) a changing style depending on audience reaction. Giving attention to these points will help to make the presentation successful for both the speaker and the listener.""Canada's Official Languages Act of 1969 conferred equal status on English and French and required documents distributed in the Public Service and federal agencies to be available in both languages. The effects of the Act were felt particularly in technical fields, since manuals, instructions, and regulations dealing with technical material and equipment had to be available in the operator's official language."In concluding this special issue the author offers a different view of the large translation agency and gives a brief survey of computer-aided translation before taking a quick look at the future of translation."Intellectual Quotient (IQ) has long been considered in education as the deciding factor in a person's success but have we overlooked emotional intelligence (EI) in determining one's success in life? In my attempt to reexamine the acceptance of EI, I studied the difference in EI between different groups of undergraduates in Singapore in terms of their field of study, gender and university. The sample comprised undergraduates from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and National University of Singapore (NUS), with a fair mix of gender and field of study. From their responses to an EI questionnaire, it was found that there was no significant difference in EI between undergraduates who study technical and non-technical courses, as well as between undergraduates of NTU and NUS, although male undergraduates achieved higher EI scores than female undergraduates.""According to an article in the campus newspaper, students at Clarkson University consider technical communication the least worthy and the least difficult of the institution's majors. This lamentable prejudice probably stems from the students' high regard for technology and its quantitative, problem-solving analysis coupled by a conversely low regard for writing, which they perceive as completely creative, the product of artistic inspiration. This paper describes my experience with these misconceptions and how I eventually came to understand that technical communication is not a contradiction in terms, that each discipline possesses unique skills that, when respected and used in conjunction with other majors, can produce remarkable results. © 1988 IEEE""Much of today's technical writing effort is focused on the environment - environmental impact statements, efforts to obtain regulatory agency permits and environmental licensing for new facilities and plant modifications, pesticide recoverability statements, and such. Thrust into nature writing of sorts, the modern technical writer might find it useful to review some of the writings of earlier nature writers, the classic naturalists. This article discusses the writings of a few of these naturalists, not necessarily as models for today's technical writer but as a means of highlighting some possible techniques to enhance current environmental reporting. For comparison, there are also given some segments of current reports dealing with environmental issues."Technical writers without a technical background can increase their usefulness to their companies - and incidentally their attractiveness to other companies - by increasing their technical knowledge about the company's products enough to allow them to assume part of the product engineer's role. The author suggests evening courses as well as in-plant training courses as means to get such knowledge."This article examines currently popular technical editorial practices in the preparation of communications directed at nontechnical readers. In light of these practices it presents source materials for reviewing readability research on available formulas and procedures, explaining their development, and demonstrating some of the benefits and pitfalls for editors and writers directing technical materials to the nontechnical reader. Concluding, the writer suggests that theoretical readability formula research become part of the corpus of information presented at pre- and in-service training programs for technical writers."Reports perceptions collected from technical writers about interactions with subject-matter experts  Argues that SMEs and technical writers cannot fully alter their relationship without strategic management support."Experience at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University indicates that students in engineering and science need a course in technical writing. A one-quarter course there begins with a review of general editing principles, based on Strunk and White's Elements of Style, and an introduction to specific principles of organizing and editing technical material. Students then write a series of assignments using specific formats, such as technical descriptions, memos, instructions, letters, proposals, and formal reports or articles. Students have found the course valuable; their opinions are reinforced by those of the faculty.""Many technical writing programs across the country have their students go out into the community and do writing projects for local businesses, campus organizations, government agencies, or nonprofit organizations. Few, however, take advantage of the increasingly popular pedagogy known as service learning. This article describes how to set up such service-learning courses and how to anticipate certain types of problems. Also discussed are some of the many benefits, both pedagogical and civic/humanitarian, that this truly real-world approach brings to the teaching of technical writing and, potentially, to the teaching of other forms of professional writing.""Technical writing and computer programming are based on similar principles, perhaps because both are mechanisms for efficiently organizing and communicating complex information. Both technical writing and programming are multistep processes involving planning, drafting, and revising. Moreover, six key aspects of computer programming (modularity, modifiability, user interface, failsafe presentation, style, and debugging) have analogs among such technical writing principles and practices as report sectioning, audience analysis and adaptation, and editing. This paper discusses the similarities between the two disciplines and describes a course, Technical Writing for Computer Science, that builds on these likenesses to teach technical writing to programming students. © 1988 IEEE""The author gives guidance to technical writers, engineers, proposals specialists, and managers who compete for government contracts. Ten writing and illustrating strategies that can help create winning proposals are presented.""What is currently known about the history of the paragraph has relied on the work of the first English and American compositionists, humanists, and philologists of the late nineteenth century. Alexander Bain and his followers defined the requirements for the English paragraph and believed it had not existed prior to the eighteenth century. Their sole focus, on humanist and historical writing, yielded a distorted, if not an incorrect history of the paragraph. This article begins to correct that view, prevalent since 1866, by examining paragraphs of practical works, such as printed how-to books of the early English Renaissance until 1700. The variety and quantity of how-to documents increased with the growth of knowledge, advent of printing, and emergence and expansion of middle-class English readers eager for books written in an accessible, non-Latinate style. When we examine paragraphs from technical books printed as early as 1490, we find paragraphs that exemplify the qualities stipulated by Bain nearly 400 years later. The existence of well defined and formulated paragraphs throughout the English Renaissance and the seventeenth century in a wide variety of technical book-works ignored by literary scholars pursuing the history of English-suggests that the paragraph is clearly indigenous to the English composition, much more so than modern composition theory has acknowledged. This article explores example paragraphs of these first English printed technical works and begins to expand the history of the English paragraph. Further studies of later Middle English paragraphs in incunabula of practical, liturgical, and historical works will likely show the indigenous nature of the paragraph to English composition and allow scholars to see how the formation of the paragraph helped English writers over 500-700 years ago create complete texts. © 2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Liberal arts colleges that elect to introduce technical writing courses or programs into their curriculum face the dilemma of vocationalism vs. liberal education. This paper examines the philosophical differences between the two as well as the practical compatibility or incompatibility, and then argues for the union of technical writing and the liberal arts school while admitting certain reservations. The technical writing course at a liberal arts school should use a wider range of books and periodicals than should a technical school, should stress rhetorical theory and strategy, and should confront the moral issues resulting from technology.""Translation is a form of technical writing in that both translators and technical writers assess their work by comparing it with a concrete object or process (a technical text with its subject, a translation with its original). Among aspects of language that concern translators and technical writers is that of ″sublanguages″ , subsets of a language used in special fields of knowledge, having distinct lexical, grammatical, and syntactic features. Sublanguage knowledge plays a vital part in both translation and technical writing. The relations found between the two professions also imply some ways technical writers can improve foreign-language services they receive.""Technical writing explains and, in contrast to other kinds of writing, insists on the visual. Explanation and visualization are mutually dependent, because explanation combines 'description,' the observable facts, and 'diagram,' the graphic paradigm of the relations that obtain among these facts. The technical writer's principal task, then, is to make explicit, by using appropriate spatial, temporal, and logical signals, one of three diagrams - schematic, flowchart, tree - that define the basic modes of explanation - object, process, and logical hierarchy. Where the novelist submerges the diagram in metaphoric layers, the technical writer strips them away and surfaces the diagram.""Argues that skill with information technologies is a core competency of technical communication* Concludes that writers learn and implement many other core competencies through information technologies""This study presents an instrument, the Technical Writing Attitude Measurement, that measures students' attitudes toward their technical writing skills and provides data and objectives which help the instructor develop instructional materials and assignments to improve student skills. The Technical Writing Attitude Measurement, a Likert-type, self-report questionnaire, is based upon instructional goals that may be divided into three categoeies: rhetorical principles, planning strategies, and drafting skills. The instrument was used to measure changes in student attitude toward technical writing skills. These changes were influenced by two main methods of instruction, the case method and the rhetorical approach to teaching technical writing. The study indicates that 1) the instrument can be used to measure change in student attitude toward technical writing skills; 2) the instructor can establish course objectives by administering the questionnaire; 3) the most significant change, as measured by the magnitude of a paired t-statistic, occurred in the drafting skills category. The authors suggest and illustrate several techniques for analyzing the data generated by the Technical Writing Attitude Measurement.""Advancing technology, demands for cost control, and world-wide expansion in distance education programs challenge technical communication teachers to find ways of delivering quality technical writing courses by distance.

Shipwrightery texts did not appear in English until the middle decades of the seventeenth century because shipwrightery was a closed discourse community which shared knowledge via oral transmission. The shift from orality to textuality in shipwrightery did not occur until advancing navigation principles enabled ships to sail in open waters. Shipping rapidly became a commercial business, and shipwrightery was forced to move from closely-guarded simple design principles to mathematically-based designs too complex to be retained only in memory of shipwrights and shared via oral transmission. Textual transmission began to supplant oral instruction. The evolution of English shipwrightery provides rich research opportunities for historians tracking the development of technical writing.""English technical writing clearly emerged during the Renaissance and the first decades of printing, but during the 1641-1700 period technical writing gained credibility and prestige. It was a valued tool for achieving the utilitarian ends of an age in which practical goals were valued more than aesthetic ones. Technical writing can be found in a range of disciplines, such as agriculture, medicine, science, as well as the major English trades and crafts. As a valued form of discourse, it illuminates the world of work in seventeenth-century England and the problems faced by the early experimenters of the Royal Society who sought to use science to solve major human, military, and economic problems while seeking to expand understanding of nature. Studying technical writing of this period allows us to track the continued development of technical writing as a distinct form of discourse. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Three present-day developments are very likely to have a major influence upon technical writing in the nineteen eighties. These are: interactive lectures, information storage and retrieval, and the development of an ultra-small electronic camera for movies, television, and still pictures. Carefully tested interactive lectures will provide individual attention for learners at the time it is most needed. Under a perfected system of information storage and retrieval, the technical writer would suggest to the reader the kinds of information to request from a nation-wide information bank, and would also assist in the screening of information so that learners would not be deluged by surplus information. The small electronic camera will enable the technical writer to illustrate instructions on the user's TV set. Thus, technical writer of the eighties could well become a writer-producer.""It is argued that the management world is becoming more aware of the value of documenting controls for the administration and operation of organizations. That awareness unfortunately does not include the fact that many of these management-system writings--writings that are meant to get things done--are ineffective as well as inefficient. Writing mechanics tailored to the discipline of systems writing developed at the Grumman Corporation are described. They stem from the view that systems writing must be tailored to the system reader's communication needs, where the thoughts and words used in the systems document are not only properly selected and arranged, but are written in the easiest-to-read manner.""This article is about the profession of technical writing in the Netherlands. The data are mainly based on two studies. The first was directed at technical writers who work as freelancers (external writers). It was done with the objective of learning about the characteristics and backgrounds of external technical writers and about their wishes concerning the development of the profession. The second study was directed at technical writers who work inside organizations (internal writers) and focused on questions about text quality and the writing problems that threaten this quality. We will focus on three issues. After the introduction in the first section and the description of the design of our studies in the second section, we will give a global profile of technical writers in the Netherlands. In the fourth section we will give an impression of the writing problems internal technical writers have to deal with. In the fifth section opinions concerning more professionalism in the field of technical writing are discussed. Also attention is paid to current developments in professionalism.""Most technically oriented students are never exposed to lessons in effective technical writing skills. The technical writer must use correct grammar and exact language in descriptions of precise, technical subjects. Personal style must be adapted to achieve the desired impact. The writer must also learn how to communicate to various levels of audiences, for not all readers will possess the same knowledge about a subject. Also the writer must learn to use graphic aids in the presentation of an article.""To find out what kinds of writing are required of graduate engineering students, twenty-five engineering faculty members from the Engineering College at the University of Florida listed the kinds of writing assigned to graduate classes during the academic year 1979-80. Since the faculty members were asked to rank-order the writing kinds from most frequent to least frequent, the Friedman analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test were used to test for differences in the rank ordering. The tests showed that faculty-assigned examinations, quantitative problems, and reports most frequently, that they assigned homework and papers (term and publication) less frequently, and that they assigned progress reports and proposals least frequently.""The textbook one chooses for a technical writing course will contribute a definition of the subject, whether implicit or explicit, but the definition and scope of what is loosely called technical writing are by no means agreed. The issue has been further confused by the increasing popularity of undergraduate writing courses and the concomitantly increasing diversity of students who enroll in technical writing courses. The article presents selected examples of textbooks for technical writing courses, to illustrate the current trends in the field and the choices available to the teacher today. It reviews the comprehensive, composition-based text, authologies and handbooks, process-based books, and books that combine two of these approaches.""Modern technical writing often suffers from its tendency toward jargon. Technical writing courses should include units on grammar as it relates to stylistics in technical writing. Transformational-generative TG grammar offers an effective and useful approach to train technical writers to communicate more effectively and to avoid the problems inherent in an impersonal style. One way of organizing a discussion of transformational -generative grammar is to consider its application to sentences and clauses, phrases, and individual words.""Technical writing involves more than simply the ″nuts and bolts″ of preparing a good report. Good technical writing must be an effective communication, and in order for the writer (source) to obtain the desired response from the reader (receiver), the writer must have a clear conceptualization of the communication process, and must realize that the source, the message, the channel, and the receiver are important variables that influence the success of technical communication. The technical writer must be aware of the ″filter″ stages the receiver moves through before ultimately making a response to the message. The technical writer who creates a proper meld of the basics of good technical writing with an understanding of the communication process can produce an effective technical communication.""Design and development engineers have a responsibility to communicate and cooperate fully with technical writers if successful publications are to emerge from an organization. It is the writer's obligation to obtain the respect and confidence of the engineers so that information is rendered accurately and for mutual benefit. Such information may take the form of explanatory documents, manuals, brochures, reports, specifications, and publications for employee training. Illustrations are part of an international technical writing language. Their purpose is to convey a message with little or no text and they must be carefully crafted not to hand the reader a puzzle. 2 refs.""Many of today's students are turned off by those forms of technical writing found in the classroom. A key factor contributing to this attitude may be the inability of today's authors to stimulate reader interest. The article touches upon the way in which the student approaches technical literature, and the way in which today's author may attract his reader's attention to the subject presented. Various devices utilized in today's technical literature are also discussed in conjunction with the stimulation of reader interest.""The problems with flawed technical documents are frequently problems of a larger nature. When the subject to be described is itself amorphous or internally illogical, technical writing may only dutifully reproduce the inherent confusion. Writers should be alert to identifying these problems and assisting product/procedure designers in eliminating confusion at its source.""The author of this article directs his remarks primarily to teachers of literature who may be considering the teaching of technical writing. He shows the similarities existing among the forms of creative, expository, and technical writing. He then cites some of the differences: the interactions of writer, subject, and the audience; the use of graphics; and the emphasis of the practical rather than the aesthetic.""For multinational companies the written report is a major medium of communication. Moving on this assumption, this article suggests that problems do occur within reports between German subsidiaries and parent American companies in the United States. The discussion is divided into two parts, namely, problems associated with operating and action reports as viewed by Germans and Americans, and the place of exterior forces such as culture and language upon the written report. In the end, cultural variances may be the major factor affecting written communication within a company of two different nationalities.""Method: A phenomenological research approach was used to interview ten preservice teachers to explore the question, “what is the nature of preservice teachers’ experiences with technology and technical communication in the classroom?”.Purpose: Computer-based presentations are the expected form of instruction in education; however, little knowledge exists about perspectives and attitudes on the use of technology and technical communication in the classroom through preservice teachers’ experiences. Therefore, the focus in our explorative study is to understand these perspectives and attitudes to aid in the development of technology and technical communication curriculums for preservice teachers.Results: Preservice teachers’ educational experiences with technology and technical communication show a strong preference for using Microsoft PowerPoint to convey course content. However, a major theme from their perspectives and attitudes was negative toward formal PowerPoint communication training. Furthermore, participants stressed the over reliance on PowerPoint in the classroom; they desired more creativity and better ways of communicating course content.Conclusion: This study provides evidence worthy of serious reflection on the reality that there is a significant issue in teacher education curriculum today and the ineffective use and instruction of technology and technical communication in educational settings. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

The most common pattern, in which the items to be discussed are listed, is boring and can leave unanswered some critical questions that can prevent the reader from paying full attention. This article describes techniques, based on four of the journalistic prompts (what, where, why, and how), that can help writers create contexts for their readers, thereby improving readers' comprehension and enlisting them in the creation of the discourse. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

One hundred and twenty persons participated in semi-structured interviews or completed two critical incident forms. Grounded theory was used to analyze the interviews and the critical incident data, and naturalistic observations were used to provide depth and context to the discussion. The analysis of the data indicates that organizational members tend to give CMCS favorable reviews. However, the data also illustrated considerable variance in how or ganizational members view the impact of CMCS on interpersonal relationships, message structures, task efficiency, the work environment, and information processing characteristics of organizations. Secondary or unanticipated effects of CMCS are identified and discussed as potentially having a significant impact on organizations. © 1991, Sage Publications.

The article goes further to assert that the function of technocratic discourse in public policy is to advocate and promulgate a highly contentious political and economic agenda under the guise of scientific objectivity and political impartiality. We provide strong evidence to support the linguistic description, and the claims of political advocacy, by analyzing a 900-word document about globalization produced by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Following recent work to advocate a strongly social understanding of technological literacy, this article considers how networking technologies are reshaping our understanding of the social. In this context, technological literacy can be understood as a process of constructing the networks in which literate action is defined. I explore the role of technological literacy as a force of network building accomplished through a mechanism of translation. From the comments of experienced technical communicators, I make observations about how technical communicators are taught to be technologically literate. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""Technology use and adaptation are the center of attention in research on virtual teams. Through empirical observations from six interpretative cases of virtual teams, we suggest conceptualizing the relationship between technology-use practices and collaborative practices as a technology-alignment process. We define technology alignment based upon four key perspectives on technology-use practices: continuous iterative process, reflection-on-action activities, malleability and reconfigurability, and transformation. Moreover, we show how these four key perspectives influence the design, the outcome, the task processes, and the socioemotional processes of the particular virtual team. © 2010 IEEE.""Technical communication scholars have argued that communication skills can be used to promote and enhance ethical uses of technology. This essay articulates a related view: technical communicators should remain cognizant of the ways that technologies can inhibit ethical communication practices. The author proposes a framework for evaluating the degree to which communication technologies promote ethical communication. This framework's applicability is then demonstrated in an explication of the ethical problems associated with “Caller Identification.”. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper describes the characteristics of the various microforms and the applications for which they are best suited. On an overview basis, filming techniques, film processing, and methods of duplicating microforms are presented. The hardware and processes for using microforms, such as readers, reader - printers, enlarger printers, and retrieval devices are discussed. The advantages of microforms to business, industry, education, libraries, government, institutions, and many other areas of activity are also explored.""This article develops a framework for the examination of organizational newcomer socialization, in light of recent developments in communication and information technologies. The proposed model specifies how newcomers to organizations select and use advanced technologies to access information and facilitate interpersonal relationships that contribute to successful organizational socialization. In view of technological advances and current trends in organizations, the authors argue that such a model helps to make sense of contemporary socialization processes. The model is based on the premise that accurate, appropriate, and sufficient information is crucial to newcomers' efforts to become successfully socialized and considers how newcomers' selection and use of advanced technologies can aid in information acquisition. The authors propose a number of factors that may predict organizational newcomers' use of technologies toward this end, including features of their socialization experiences, individual attitudes and personality characteristics, and group and organizational norms with regard to technology use. The article concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of this perspective for organizations and their members. © 2004 by the Association for Business Communication.""Computer-mediated communication on the Internet offers new challenges and opportunities for technical communication. The cases of Lotus MarketPlace and the Clipper chip illustrate the specialized nature of technical communities on the Internet and suggest that when technical messages are not overly complex, the process of reposting may widen community appeal but also promote inaccurate information. Yet, when technical messages are highly complex, audiences may not repost such messages; this preserves accuracy of information but at the same time limits how many people will read the information. Finally, these cases strengthen recent arguments that rhetorical delivery is an increasingly important component of technical communication. © 1996 Sage Publications, Inc.""This article describes telecommunications, which encompasses the electromagnetic transmission of information, and then examines an important subunit: teleconferencing. Teleconferencing is viewed from the voice, print, and video perspectives and is compared by cost, bandwidth, and speed of feedback. Suggestions on how to prepare for teleconferencing sessions are presented, as are implications to industry, to students, and to teachers of business communication. © 1984, Sage Publications.

A perceived loss of control and a sense of being taken advantage of, may be experienced by a manager as employees disappear from the manager's daily gaze. To enable the transition of employees to virtual work arrangements, managers who work in bureaucratic organizations that value a high degree of control and stability may need to change their management style to accommodate new methods of employee communication and interaction. Alternately, corporate cultures well suited for the transition value results and are characterized as having the atmosphere of trust (a shared emotional understanding about who is to be trusted based on compatible values and open communications/attitudes). Telecommuting, as one form of virtual work arrangement, provides a prime opportunity to look into the management attitudes and corporate cultures that may hinder the transition of workers into remote settings. This study of telecommuting among Information Technology (IT) professionals suggests that management trust of employees, the ability to secure the technology involved, a rational culture, and a group culture, which emphasizes human resources and member participation, facilitate telecommuting implementation. Thus this study offers strong support for the important role of trust, security, and culture in the implementation of virtual work arrangements.""With a highly sophisticated international and national series of telephone networks readily at hand, computer conferencing becomes practicable from any place on the Earth near a telephone. This necessary resource, however, is a very costly one in terms of its usage fees. The enormous expense of ordinary telephone usage is brought into manageable proportions to make computer conferencing for education feasible by (a) use of 'intelligent' terminals (standard home computers) to compose and read text off-line, (b) print data telephone networks that transmit computer data at rates drastically lower than ordinary voice costs, and (c) high speed modems that transmit as fast as 2400 bps now, and may do so even faster in the near future.""Translation in the United States usually means working from English into other languages in order to sell or support a particular product. Only occasionally is there a need to make available in English information written in some other language. But in a bilingual environment, where two languages are widely known and used, translation takes on a new dimension. Such is the case in Canada, an officially bilingual country, where both English and French have equal legal status.""How do large corporations use certainty in their public business communications? Do corporate profit status, industry type, or communication mode (oral versus written) affect their use of certainty? The ""Management Discussion and Analysis"" section of the 10-K reports of 72 Fortune 500 companies and corporate spokespersons' recorded public oral business discourse were analyzed with a text-analysis software program (DICTION 4.0) to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that (a) corporate use of certainty in public business discourse is not affected by organizational profitability status or industry type; (b) a significant difference in the use of certainty exists between corporate oral and written communications; and (c) the use of certainty in corporate public business discourse does not differ significantly from that in general discourse. © 1999 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article explores the adaptive functions of storytelling in the workplace from an evolutionary perspective. Based on the analysis of ethnographic studies on hunter-gatherer and modern work organizations, this article claims that storytelling, as an adapted cognitive device, was selectively retained by natural and sexual selection, because of its survival and reproductive payoff. The narrative production through storytelling is a natural coping mechanism and has been functional in both old and new ways of working life under different ecological conditions. This article also highlights underlying adapted psychological mechanisms of storytelling and discusses some evolutionarily informed practical implications and pedagogical applications. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article examines the previously untapped site of business development networks (BDNs), a fast-evolving promotional environment where small business owners try to gain new business through an organized word-of-mouth campaign. Drawing on a data set of 60-second business networking speeches, this study centers on the display of professional competence through promotional mini-presentations. More specifically, this study explores the use of small narrative as a means of communicating the speaker's professional competence. Thirty stories embedded in BDN 60-second slots were transcribed so that the generic patterns navigating these narratives could be analyzed. The findings indicate that to communicate professional competence, the speakers rely on the success story as the chief master narrative and use predominantly the problem-solution generic pattern. The problem and solution phases tend to involve increased deployment of high-involvement lexis such as hyperbole and extreme case formulations and they are often framed as constructed dialogue. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Narrative analysis helps us better understand how writers handle complex business communication challenges. This study analyzed shareholder reports of equity mutual funds whose total returns were high in absolute terms, but low in relative terms. These reports were complex in that the returns were ambiguous and, although the subject matter was technical, the readership was broad. Narrative analysis reveals that mixed-return shareholder reports use a nonlinear hyperstructure, dramatize ideas through contrasting narrators, embed a variety of subgenres, and complement verbal with visual discourse in order to make readers active participants in constructing the investment story. Readers' responses to these reports depends not only on their intellectual understanding, but also on their emotional interaction with the narrator personae and visual symbolism. The discourse texture, the underlying fabula, and the story affect how readers experience a text. Applied similarly, narrative analysis could elucidate other business communication genres, principles, problems, and questions. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""Previous research has indicated that engineering faculty do not follow best practices when commenting on students' technical writing. However, it is unclear whether the faculty prefer to comment in these ineffective ways, or whether they prefer more effective practices but simply do not enact them. This study adapts a well known study of response in composition to ask whether engineering faculty prefer authoritative, form-focused comments, or whether they may prefer to write different sorts of comments. We asked ten civil engineering faculty to comment on a sample paper and then rank their preferences for provided versions of comments on the same paper. One provided version emphasized comments on content, one emphasized comments on form, and one was balanced. Comparisons of the respondents' preferences and practices suggest that the engineering faculty recognize and value content-focused, non-authoritative responses, but generally do not write comments that conform to these values. We consider the implication of these findings for research on response to technical writing as well as for technical writing faculty in their own course. While recognizing the need for more research, we also discuss ways in which writing professionals, including WAC administrators and technical writing professors, can encourage engineering faculty to enact their preferences for response styles that reflect best practices.""We describe ten common misconceptions about the minimalist approach to documentation design. For each, we analyze how the misconception arises from plausible interpretations of minimalist principles and heuristics.

These rules tell how to create readable writing: (1) Read some great writing every day; (2) use genuinely familiar words; (3) break sentences into clearly defined units; (4) use signals in sentences (because, so, but); (5) make the subjects and verbs absolutely clear; (6) balance sentences with parallel structures; (7) use nouns sparingly, especially as modifiers; (8) make sentences answer Who does what? ; (9) surprise the reader with variety; and (10) do not hesitate to break a rule or create a new one.""Myths often represent the very human attempt to explain something important but poorly understood, such as the turning of the seasons, or to provide cautionary tales to warn listeners against unsanctioned behavior, as in the myths of Prometheus and Epimetheus. The fascination inspired by myths has kept many alive across the millennia, but despite the degree of abstraction or exaggeration that makes them so fascinating, there is often a grain of truth or an insight into some fundamental aspect of the human condition at their heart. In our current enlightened age, we fancy that we've grown beyond the need for myths, yet ""urban legends"" abound (particularly on the Internet), and many of the things we do in our daily work are strongly influenced by ""rules of thumb"" that are, in a very real sense, a form of myth.""This paper, addressed to document designers and documentation managers, describes the form and use of the Teradata Document Template. The Teradata Document Template is a hardcopy planning tool that was developed by Mary St. John of Teradata Corporation. The Teradata Document Template is a tool that was developed to help its document designers plan their documentation projects. The template forces the designer to address ten variables that pertain to document development. These variables are: 1) Title, 2) Timing, 3) Purpose, 4) Audience, 5) Approach, 6) Form, 7) Writer, 8) Input, 9) Content, 10) Schedule. A blank template is described, with considerations for properly identifying each of the variables. Completed templates for four different documents are then presented. Comparison of the four templates shows the inherent flexibility of the template in capturing the specifications for various types of customer documents.""Terminal technology in the next two decades will be based largely on current and near-future research and development (R&D) which, in turn, is based largely on what today's terminal users and R&D managers think will be wanted in the future. In the realm of office work, the R&D priority is predicted to be the use of computers to regain the advantages of human communication, e. g. , in teleconferencing; paper as an office medium; and intensive and accessible work environments.""In this study, we examined 11 workplaces to determine how they handle termination documentation, an empirically unexplored area in technical communication and rhetoric. We found that the use of termination documentation is context dependent while following a basic pattern of infraction, investigation, intervention, and termination. Furthermore, the primary audience of the documentation is typically legal and regulatory bodies, not the employee. We also make observations about genre, collaboration, and authorship in these documents. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper describes a methodology for testing the usability of a digital library. The paper also presents the results from using this methodology on a specific library of technical manuals. The testing process involves timing subjects while they look up facts in comparable libraries of online and paper documents. They are timed for both how long they take to find a desired manual in the library and how long they take to find a desired fact in a chosen manual. Next, the subjects fill out a questionnaire on which type library they prefer using and why. The objective time results and the subjective preferences are compared and analyzed.""User-testing of computer documentation is beginning to move into the laboratory. A properly conducted user test offers the software producer much information that cannot be obtained in any other manner.

In addition, a detailed case study of a laboratory-based usability test is presented.""This study tests the recognition of errors in context and whether the presence of errors affects the reader’s perception of the writer’s ethos. In an experimental, posttest only design, participants were randomly assigned a memo to read in an online survey: one version with errors and one version without. Of the six intentional errors in version one, on average, readers only noticed two errors, which suggests that readers notice some but not all errors. The ethos ranking for the writer was also statistically significant between the two versions, suggesting that the presence of errors can affect the writer’s ethos. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""In visual querying, users analyze data for their decisions and problems by interacting with graphics that are dynamic and linked. This querying paradigm is new, a dramatic break from the more familiar retrieving of data via search statements and displaying of it in static charts and graphs. For this new visual querying paradigm, analysts conceptually and operationally need to master new approaches. To discover salient relationships, they need to manipulate displays. To drill down for detail or causes, they have to select data of interest directly from a graph. And to draw inferences, they have to consider meanings across several dynamically linked graphics. With the aim of studying users' success in these new approaches, particularly focusing on the approach of directly selecting data from graphs, I conducted a scenario-based usability test with 10 data analysts. They interacted with visualizations to complete a realistic complex analysis-evaluating employee performance. Test findings reveal a range of difficulties in visual selection that, at times, gave rise to inaccurate selections, invalid conclusions, and misguided decisions. To overcome these difficulties, support for visual selection needs to be built into interfaces and help. Results and recommended improvements are presented.""Reports a card sort study conducted to determine whether users rather than experts could distinguish visual (in-)consistency in Web elements and pages* Finds that color, background, and font were the main visual cues that users paid attention to""Results of the study reported here establish that contrary to the suspicions of some teachers of English, engineering and science students do not deteriorate in writing ability between the time they complete Freshman English and the time they graduate.

A selective combination of these components comprises a computer-assisted writing and editing system for professionals at Argonne National Laboratory, used primarily for technical reports. Text is entered and corrected at a terminal keyboard, viewed on a CRT, and stored on a magnetic disc; camera-ready copy is obtained on an electrostatic printer. Engineers and scientists enter original text and do creative editing; typewriter-qualified personnel quickly learn to handle other editing and corrections; and computer-support personnel provide periodic file-management services.""Following Rogers's theory of the diffusion of innovations, the author questions whether youth entering the workforce will act as change agents to evolve primary business communication channels from email to text-messaging. Expanding on research performed in 2009, the author investigates three communication scenarios: scheduling meetings, exchanging information in the workplace, and keeping in contact with family and friends. Follow-up research also gathers information about communication hardware trends. The author concludes that change agents and early adopters already in the company, not new hires, will effect a change in communication media that will involve new technology such as smartphones. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study used quantitative and qualitative measures to determine differences in learning outcomes between two sections of an advanced technical writing course taught by the same instructor. The instructor used traditional textbook methods in one and technology-enhanced methods in the other. The findings upheld those of previous studies in that students in the experimental group rated both the course and their learning higher than that of their counterparts in the control group. Although fewer significant differences than expected resulted from the many measures taken, substantive positive differences in the writing submitted by students in the experimental group did occur. In order for such changes in performance to emerge as statistically significant differences, evaluation criteria for technical communication students may need to change.""Instructors and practicing technical communicators frequently find little time to examine thoroughly recent textbooks and other resource materials for use in instruction. The following introduction and extensively annotated bibliography provides a convenient way to narrow the scope of selecting pedagogical materials by discussing recent, easily accessible books in the field. The bibliography consists of two parts: Part I is devoted to more traditional textbooks appropriate for classroom use whether in the academy or in industry and business; Part II discusses such other resource materials for collateral use and supplementary reading as scholarly studies, anthologies, and handbooks.

While assignment grades for students using the programs did not improve the first two semesters of use, grades did improve the third semester, which may reflect the extensive refinements the authors made to the programs after the first two semesters. Likewise, assignment preparation time increased the first two semesters and decreased the third semester, indicating that teachers and laboratory assistants need time to learn how to help students use the computers and programs efficiently. Students consistently showed favorable attitudes toward using the programs. © 1986, Sage Publications.

Though the guide is described as a nonpartisan, plain-language handbook by its authors, it can be implicated in the production and reproduction of a discursive process that further constructs a degraded notion of both undocumented individuals and immigration. Many of the politicians that published statements in the guide continually associate undocumented immigrants and immigration with both the use of firearms and with crime in general. Additionally, I find that the majority of politicians in this document perpetuate this demeaning, violent, and inaccurate discourse for personal political gain.

In an era dominated by identifiable medieval male technical writers, this article analyzes the medical texts of Hildegard von Bingen, which should be recognized as significant scientific and medical contributions to the field of medical-technical writing. Because the term ""technical writing"" or ""technical writer"" did not exist during the Middle Ages, accrediting female medieval scientific and medical writers as technical writers requires the application of modern thought and definition. Primarily known as a mystic and writer of poetry and music, Hildegard's technological and medical texts have slowly gained interest within the medical community. Her texts Physica and Causae Curae, written in the style of modern-day patient history and physicals, outline patient symptoms, causes and effects, preceded by a treatment plan. This article examines Hildegard von Bingen's medical works, identifying her as a scientific or medical technical writer within the same context from which scholars assign Chaucer the same title, and from which all medical and scientific writers of medical texts can be professionally accredited as technical communicator or writer. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The article presents a speech by Richard S.

Therefore, it is necessary to look at how readers are constructed as partners in a communication co-production. This article explores the concept of the ""active reader,"" which is getting more and more attention nowadays. Its main aim is to present a typology of what this active readership means, in the phases before actual reading, in the reading phase, and in the after-reading phase.

The purpose of this article is to analyze the features of online scholarly journals and to determine whether they incorporate new Internet-enabled features and functions which help to meet the needs of the members of the scholarly community more effectively. Drawing on Taylor's concept of added value [1], the features of online scholarly journals were classified into the following types: features which enhance ease of use and facilitate access to data, features that provide selected information and thus reduce noise, features which improve quality, features which address specific user needs, and features which contribute to time or cost savings. The analysis revealed that, although some online journals operate in the same way as print journals, there are others which incorporate innovative features which are transforming the journal to make it a more effective tool for scholarly activity.""The international strategies of an organization - ethnocentric, polycentric, geocentric, heterarchic - are reflected in its international communication. The discussion presented here, based on Hedlund's application of Perlmutter's categorization of management strategies,focuses on the alignment of an organization's goals and market positions with its international communication approaches. The categorization implies that an organization's global management strategies should be aligned with its international communication practices. As such, an organization that seeks a larger role in the international market yet takes an ethnocentric stance in its communication strategies may be less successful than one with a more polycentric, geocentric, or heterarchic approach to international communication. Thinking about international communication within such a framework enhances not only consulting practice but teaching as well."Few papers have been published that describe how authors go about writing book reviews. This article provides an account of the procedures used to write one specific book review. Examples are given to illustrate what is basically a three-stage procedure: making notes; creating a rough draft; and polishing the final version. Some comments on the language of book reviews are included."A major purpose of courses in intercultural communication is often to improve students' ability to perform well in situations with the potential to be both highly enlightening and highly difficult-in multicultural teams. This article reports the results of exercises in which members of a dysfunctional multicultural class were assigned to teams and given a task to perform in an anonymous, virtual-team setting, as well as in a real-team setting. Team members contributed in a much more balanced manner in the anonymous virtual-team exercise. However, team members nevertheless believed their input had been heard and appreciated in the real-team setting. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""A review of the history of writing instruction reveals that current instructors face essen tially the same problems as did their counterparts in previous generations and that their complaints remain essentially the same as well. With the commonly used methodologies for writing instruction, many students fail to learn as much as their in structors expect, and composition classes are typically endured rather than enjoyed by student and instructor alike. This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of several common methodologies for the teaching of writing and suggests that the tech niques of behavior analysis offer the best hope for developing instructional methodologies that will provide the best results for both writing students and their teachers. Students participating in a pilot study employing behavioral strategies showed a significant decrease in the frequency of errors between pre- and posttest letter samples. Similar testing across instructional methodologies may indicate consistently effective instructional techniques. © 1989, Sage Publications.

It focuses on issues that led to the need for an organization devoted to technical writing, and the individuals who were leaders in ATTW, as well as in NCTE and CCCC, whose efforts provided the foundation for the presence of technical writing as a legitimate teaching and research discipline. We draw on existing historical pieces and the contributions provided by many of the first ATTW members to capture the history of ATTW. We describe the major changes in ATTW from 1973-2007 and conclude with our reflections, as well as important questions we believe to be critical to the future of ATTW. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.""Steven Katz's ""The Ethic of Expediency"" has become a reference point for discussions of ethics since its 1992 publication. Previously, this author assessed Katz's rhetorical analysis of Nazi technical communication against current research on the Holocaust and noted that scholarship suggests ideology rather than technological expediency as its motivating force. Yet implicit in the author's critique are two remaining questions, namely: What other rhetorical interpretations may be possible of the SS technical memo analyzed by Katz? And is Katz, who makes broad generalizations about Western rhetoric based on a single document, supported by examples of other Nazi technical communications? This article explores alternate interpretations of the SS memo suggested by the arguments of Rivers and Moore; presents the author's view that the Katz thesis decontextualizes the memo and that historical context argues for a primarily ideological ethos; and reviews sources for English translations of other Nazi documents.""Since 1992, Steven Katz's ""The Ethic of Expediency"" on the rhetoric of technical communication during the Holocaust has become a reference point for discussions of ethics. But how does his thesis compare to current understandings of the Holocaust? As this article describes, Katz was in step with the trend two decades ago to universalize the lessons of the genocide but his thesis presents key problems for Holocaust scholars today. Against his assertion that pure technological expediency was the ethos of Nazi Germany, current scholarship emphasizes the role of ideology. Does that invalidate his thesis? Katz's analysis of rhetoric and his universalizing application to the Holocaust are two claims that may be considered separately. Yet even if one does not agree that ""expediency"" is inherent in Western rhetoric, Katz has raised awareness that phronesis is socially constructed so that rhetoric can be unethically employed. Thus, rather than remain an uncritically accepted heuristic for technical communicators, ""The Ethic of Expediency"" can be a starting point for ongoing exploration into the ethical and rhetorical dimensions of the genre.""This article describes a dual grading process, initiated to expose students to collaborative evaluation and to verify instructor evaluation. Each group was assigned a case, with directions to print five copies of its response. I evaluated one copy, then distributed four blank copies to another group for evaluation. The group reviewed the paper and assigned a grade. I collected the graded responses, attached my graded copy, and returned the two graded copies to the composing group. Receiving feedback from both teacher and students reinforced the students confidence in the evaluation process while teaching them important lessons on audience expectations. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

One way to encourage this integration is to reemphasize the value of paper prototyping. In a recent test of a university library website, we married low-fidelity paper prototyping with medium-fidelity wireframe prototyping. When user navigation led to nonexisting pages or dead ends, users were encouraged to create what they thought should be where there was nothing. This blank-page technique gave us insights into users' mental models regarding site content and design, providing developers with useful data concerning how users conceptualized information they encountered. © 2010 IEEE.""This article presents the results of a year-long study of the business- and technical-communication market in Boston, Massachusetts.

The prevailing view today is that the brain has a modular structure, with much processing going on unconsciously. The relationship of that processing to human awareness or consciousness is the subject of four very different books from four very different fields, neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive psychology, and philosophy. Though not directly addressed in these four books, the problem of design—for pages, for documents—is, by extension, raised by the discussion of the nature of the modular mind. Recent research suggests that, because of the modularity and unpredictability of the individual mind/brain, a cognitivist theory of design for documents could be feasible only as part of a larger theory that includes social conventions. © 1990 IEEE""The ongoing antitrust battle between the U.S. Department of Justice and Microsoft Corporation presents technical communicators with two ethical questions: 1) Is it right, good, or fair for Microsoft to give away its Internet Explorer browser? 2) If Microsoft gains monopoly control over the PC browser market, will this be good for us? In this article, I exam these questions using traditional rights-based ethical theory (Kant), utilitarianism, and John Rawls' principles of justice, concluding that it is neither good nor fair for a company having a near-monopoly over a market to sell products below fair market value, nor is it good that one company stands to gain monopoly control over the PC browser market. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Awareness of the importance of effective communication in organizations has led many businesses to invest heavily in sophisticated communication media.

The authors used qualitative and quantitative data to explore factors that influence multicommunicating behavior, an increasingly common form of polychronic behavior and multitasking. The analysis builds on the concepts of social presence and media richness to describe the contemporary worker as seeking to economize in the allocation of personal presence across multiple, interleaved interactions. In the authors' exploratory qualitative study, they identified message equivocality and interlocutor status as two factors that seem to encourage (or discourage) multicommunicating. In the quantitative study (a 2 × 2 posttest design), the authors evaluated two hypotheses, confirming that equivocality and status influence the perceived likelihood of multicommunicating. The discussion section includes several suggestions for future research. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""Florida Power and Light (FPL), has undergone significant changes in its business environment and the composition of its workforce.

This paper describes those systems and explores how foreseeable changes in Florida’s demographics, FPL’s business environment, and emerging media technologies will interact to affect the evolution of the company’s employee communication. © 1992 IEEE.""The question of how best to serve students in a business writing center leads to a consideration of the rhetorical relationship among students, writing center consult ants, teaching faculty, and employers in the students' professions. Most rhetorical models consider only the writing center as occupying the middle ground between students and teaching faculty. A revision of that model, one in which the writing center and teaching faculty share the middle ground, is more appropriate for a business writing center. Moreover, writing assignments best serve business student writers when students must situate themselves within the discourse community of a post-graduation employer. Instead of fostering an adversarial relationship, business writing centers function most effectively for students when the center complements the classroom faculty. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Research and pedagogy have not kept abreast of this change. Rhetorical theory, particularly a social perspective, provides a useful foundation for understanding judicial resolution of claims arising out of writing; however, theory must also account for factors not encompassed within extended audience analysis. Current texts offer general descriptions of the laws most likely to affect business writers; in addition, writing pedagogy must provide specific strategies for avoiding liability-prone prose. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Technical writers have been doing their jobs for far too long without a definition to be satisfied with a one- or two-sentence catch-all definition, and such a definition may result in dividing technical writing into two (or more) cultures. © 1990, Sage Publications.

While a number of researchers have studied the relationship of trust and communication, little is known about the specific linkages among quality of information, quantity of information, openness, trust, and outcomes such as employee involvement. This study tests these relationships using communication audit data from 218 employees in the oil industry. Using mediation analysis and structural equation modeling, we found that quality of information predicted trust of one's coworkers and supervisors while adequacy of information predicted one's trust of top management. Trust of coworkers, supervisors, and top management influenced perceptions of organizational openness, which in turn influenced employees' ratings of their own level of involvement in the organization's goals. This study suggests that the relationship between communication and trust is complex, and that simple strategies focusing on either quality or quantity of information may be ineffective for dealing with all members in an organization. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article is the Presidential address which was presented at the President's Luncheon at the national convention of the American Business Communication Association, Phila delphia, December 28, 1973. © 1974, Sage Publications.

This article argues that though design has become more user-centered, something is still lacking: more opportunities exist for articulating feedback already present in technology-culture networks. To encourage the recovery of this feedback, this article examines discourses surrounding transportation technology and the Chōra, the variety of stakeholders who shape the progression of technology through use, negation, or re-appropriation. While this article is far from a programmatic or procedural document, it suggests opening design processes to a variety of cultural inputs beyond those marked as ""users."" It attempts to open a space for technical communicators in these multifaceted feedback loops, where Chōral influences are articulated and rearticulated for more effective transportation design."The cloze procedure assesses readability by measuring readers' success in supplying deleted words which have been replaced by blanks.

The authors contend that these professors already are proficient at coaching and mentoring and the coaching and mentoring processes are routinely undertaken as part of their standard university teaching responsibilities. As coaches, these faculty members assist their students in improving student communication abilities through observation, discussion, and follow-up. As mentors, these faculty members enter into a developmental relationship with students that extend beyond the classroom. A greater knowledge of coaching and mentoring will enhance instructional efforts and benefit students in multiple ways.""In 1798, Laborie published a manual with detailed instructions for building a coffee plantation, for example, how to purchase and care for slaves, design plantation buildings, and maintain authority.

The author advances a twofold claim: (a) that the written plan is developed in the absence of a stable textual model and (b) that the text, as part of the context, functions, in turn, as a mediational tool for solving the rhetorical problem of audience resistance. Findings show that as participants reconfigure the project into successive cycles of activity, they create corresponding zones of proximal development. This study contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of the text-context relationship and to recent elaborations of genre as an activity system that help explain the relationship between genre and learning.""Preparing people to work collaboratively also allows them to experience some issues of professional ethics, issues of cooperation, responsibility, and decision-making.

A number of organizations have used virtual teams to provide the customer responsiveness, human resource flexibility, and speed in project completion these environments demand. Virtual teams create significant communication challenges for its leaders and members. This research analyzed the communication technologies that the Customer Support Virtual Team (CST) of International Consulting Systems (ICS), the pseudonym for a Fortune 500 organization, uses to support team interaction, the degree to which ICS systems and culture supported CST, and finally, the CST members' mindset toward communication and the methods its leader used to create the trust required for effective team interaction. Interviews revealed that ICS mission, strategy, tasks, reward systems, and attitudes toward technology supported virtual team structure. CST members were provided a suite of robust technologies to facilitate interaction; however, they relied heavily on voice mail and a larger number of team, project, and organizational databases supported by Lotus Notes to generate a common language that facilitated task completion. CST members saw communication, particularly media choice, as a strategic activity that had to be planned daily. Finally, to build and maintain team trust, the CST leader used a face-to-face, three-day project kickoff, a mentoring program, and an ICS culture that promoted information sharing, team-based rewards, and employee development.""Writing is common skill for many whose job requires them to communicate through business documents. But there are many professionals who seemingly have difficulty with writing. Many engineers are required to write proposals and reports yet have received little formal writing instruction. The purpose of this study was to determine if writing apprehension, their composition process, or the presence of deadlines affects the production of documents. The hypothesis was that engineers have high writing apprehension, generally use a product-based approach, and tight deadlines negatively affect the end quality. The researcher conducted in-depth interviews with civil engineers to gauge their level of apprehension, learn their personal composition process and determine how deadlines affect their writing. While the hypothesis was not conclusively supported, the study revealed six key themes into how engineers structure their writing tasks and found that the writing environment of engineers significantly impacts the composition process.""According to this survey of California executives, the ability to communicate effectively is significant in moving businessmen to top management positions.

A born entrepreneur, Defoe's many projects included promoting and marketing the first practical diving bell, designing commercial fisheries and improving London's sewer system, producing a series of popular self-help manuals, and founding and editing the first English technical writing journal. The Projector. These were the products of Defoe's indefatigable pen, and the utilitarian simplicity of his business and technical writing has strongly influenced English prose ever since. This article will examine two major pieces of Defoe's professional writing: An Essay of Projects, (1698) a portfolio of his best proposals, and the landmark The Complete English Tradesman (1725), the first English business writing manual. These and similar texts would form the loam of Defoe's great novels, Robinson Crusoe (1719), Moll Flanders (1721), and A Journal of a Plague Year (1722). While Defoe's professional writing shaped his creative writing, his gifts as a novelist - his plain, demotic style, his knack for concise narrative and analytical summary, his ability to create convincing personas through textual documentation - shaped his business writing. Both forms of writing made him the premier spokesperson of a new social and economic order. © 1998, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article provides a critical overview of the challenges that content management poses for technical communicators who work on multilingual projects.

The effects of this trend on perceptions of workload are unknown. This article reports the results of a study in which 12 mixed-gendered teams answered questionnaires on the division and perceptions of labor in their teams. Detailed case studies of four teams supplement the questionnaires. Findings suggest that computer work was highly visible, highly valued, and dominated by men. By contrast, writing was less visible and selectively recognized. Some men were credited with strong writing skills even though they did not produce writing for the project. Moreover, some students explicitly leveraged their computer expertise to avoid writing; furthermore, these computer experts rarely shared technical expertise with others in the context of the team project. © 2005 Sage Publications.""This article discusses the concept of processin business communication.

New Information and Communication Technology (ICT) possibilities such as electronic communication (EC) media generate even more opportunities for companies to collaborate with customers during the early stages of research and development. This exploratory study examined the design process of five Dutch firms and the cultural and communicative implications of cooperation in the design process between the supplier and the customer using EC media. We found that the selected use of EC media for communication between R&D and customers has a positive effect on the design process. We also discovered that the characteristics of the most suitable EC media depend on the design activity and that the corporate and professional cultures of both the company and its customers involved in the cooperation seem to affect the communication media used. Finally, the future use of new ICT in the design area is discussed.""Linking, when properly executed, enhances the value of content by providing a consistent perspective and organizational scheme that enriches the user's experience. Link authoring, like content authoring, is a creative process of making connections between disparate yet related information. Effective link authoring requires intellect, creativity, and domain knowledge to define the relationships among concepts that can support a particular pedagogical objective. The contribution of hypermedia link authoring is often poorly understood and unrecognized by traditional academic and publishing communities. Publishers of commercial and academic hypermedia typically neither formally recognize link authoring as something that should be protected by copyright, nor do they extend to those involved in link authoring the same degree of credit or remuneration given conventional content authors or illustrators. However, with the recent explosive growth in hypermedia publishing via the World Wide Web, CD-ROM, and other digital forms, the significance of link authoring is becoming more apparent. Clearly, a new paradigm is in order, one that recognizes the contribution of link authoring in the communication of thoughts, emotions, and information.""This article discusses how personalization will affect technical communication practitioners' everyday work, and indicates to researchers which knowledge gaps scientific research needs to fill. Method: After a description of how personalization exactly works, we demonstrate that the technique is very similar to the approach to personalization as applied in ancient rhetoric. Next, we describe how the history of the concept ""the audience,"" and how it has been analyzed and approached, has led to the tactic of electronically tailoring communication to individuals. We propose the User-Centered Design approach as an approach that can help the designer get to know the individual user, thereby increasing the fit between personalized systems and users' needs, wishes, and contexts. Results: We discuss how the User-Centered Design approach needs to be adjusted to cope with the demands personalization places on the approach. Furthermore, we consider the technical communicator's role in this design process. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to devise and lead user studies that inform and evaluate each step of the personalization process. Researchers need to focus their efforts on studies that aid the design of personalized systems, like discerning in which situations personalization is of added value or not, and identifying the factors that influence the acceptance of personalization.""Technical communicators play enhanced roles in professional environments as they work more and more with XML and single-source technologies.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses identified and counted helper and other responses made by recruiters. Additional analyses indicated significant variability in the quality of interviews, the talkativeness of recruiters, and the relative impact of recruiter verbal behaviors on the applicants' ratings. Recruiters who para-phrased, asked questions, and made influencing statements tended to be rated significantly higher on their expertness, or competence. Recruiters who disclosed sometimes-irrelevant information tended to be rated significantly lower on Responsiveness. These results are discussed within the framework of both critical contacts and social influence theories. Suggestions are made for further research and for what constitutes ""good"" recruiting verbal style. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""Increasingly, professional communicators are involved in situations in which social action, and questions of ethical and civic responsibility, are implicated. Arguing that feminist scholarship is a relevant and powerful means of understanding these situations, we position the five contributions to this special issue within theoretical frameworks that explore interconnections of gender with methods and practices in technical and professional communication. After outlining areas for future research, we raise the question of men's relation to gender research and feminism, calling for more scholarship that engages a wider spectrum of feminist thought. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Snow to mend the rift between the sciences and the humanities.""The widespread adoption of component content management in organizations calls for a comprehensive summary of the territory of this phenomenon. A summary provides stakeholders in component content management with a sense of how the practice has evolved and its implications to research, theory, and future practice. The last such review was published in 2003. This integrative literature review is intended to fill the gap in the literature by describing the current state of component content management as presented in the current publications. Research questions: How is 'content' currently defined, described, and approached in the component content-management literature? What processes and tools are organizations adopting to achieve the goals of component content management? Literature review: The theoretical orientation of this review is Rhetorical Genre theory, which allows for classifying individual components as a genre characterized by granularity, reusability, and potentiality. Component content management gained recognition in the mid-1990s when early adopter organizations were looking for more efficient and effective approaches to reusing information between similar products or versions of the same product. Developments in the 2000s include a surge of publications focused on defining and describing component content management; new best practices for implementing a component content-management initiative; evolving processes and technologies for creating highly engineered, modular content that can automatically adjust to specific user requests and device capabilities; and collaborative efforts to integrate content creation and management strategies across organizational units. Scholarly and trade publications increasingly explore different concerns; whereas scholarly publications tend to offer critical perspectives on component content management, trade publications tend to describe processes and technologies and articulate best practices. Both focus on the goals of component content management, such as single sourcing, content reuse, multichannel publishing, and the structured content components required to achieve these goals. Methodology: To answer the research questions, we reviewed the body of literature on component content management. To do so, we searched library databases, Google, and Amazon.com for articles and books in both the scholarly and trade literature; we also sought out publications by well-known voices in component content management who direct successful consultant and/or research organizations. We then classified selected publications in relation to research questions and identified themes within each research question. The review did not explore other types of content management. Results and conclusions: Current component content-management literature suggests that component content management has evolved from a practice focused on single sourcing and reuse strategies for product documentation to a mature discipline concerned with designing pre-sales and post-sales information products for a multitude of devices and delivery channels. In recent years, trade publications have led the way to standardizing the discipline's core concepts, methodologies, processes, and technologies, such as structured content, structured authoring, single sourcing, component-based content strategy, Extensible Markup Language authoring tools, and component-content-management systems. Scholarly publications, however, have had comparatively little impact on advancing the discipline of component content management because only a handful of publications have focused on the topic and almost no crosstalk exists between these publications and the trade literature. Several questions about the practices of component content management still need to be answered, particularly in the areas of multilingual communication and content quality and usability. Based on the results of the literature review, we call for a coherent, robust, and ambitious component content-management research agenda that addresses topics such as content quality and usability, the diffusion of content-management systems, and global content management and that leads to studies that both advance scholarship and improve component content-management practice. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Although many excellent histories of photography and its invention exist, few focus on the rhetoric employed in debates over scientific priority and the romantic construct of nature as the active agent in photographic processes. This article surveys the range and complexity of rhetorical claims made for the first practical photographic process, daguerreotypy. It presents a rereading of the standard and romanticized history of the invention, defines the daguerreotype as a made object and cultural artifact with its own supratextual rhetoric, and presents examples from the discourse of 1839-1860 that show how daguerreotypes were argued to be simultaneously equal to, superior to, and inferior to natural human perceptions and representations.""This case study describes an incident at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant in Oak Harbor, OH. and discusses ways in which the case study can be used to examine ethical communication problems such as a basis for writing analytical reports that compare, justify, and analyze materials and issues in technical writing courses.

Critical theory focuses on the structure of meaning that embodies and reinforces domination and how that communication is systematically distorted so as to maintain and enhance power relations that privilege one social reality over others and that favor some interest groups at the expense of other groups. To explore the meaning of symbols in this context is to seek to discover the deep structure of the relationship of power to social reality. Applying a critical theory perspective to the workforce's culture, language, and symbols, provides us insight into a pattern of power agendas in the deep structural meaning that determines which issues and which questions will be legitimately open for debate while other privileges are defined as the way things are, not susceptible to change, as if defined by natural law, and that makes discussion pointless. Our ability to understand, and to teach our students to understand, the distortion of communication to impose power, and to respond to its seemingly arbitrary exercise, gives us a particular responsibility to attend to the issue of diversity in the workplace. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Strategic planning can help an organization mature and become more effective and efficient.

We gathered similarity data with a card sorting tasks using EMACS commands. We then used hierarchical cluster analysis to analyze the data. The results indicate that differences among novices, intermediates, and experts appear with computer-based concepts such as windows and buffers, but that the sorts are more similar than they are different. We argue that cluster analysis may aid designers in determining a functional organization, but that in our domain, this organization may not help users bridge the mapping from real world tasks to computer tasks. © 1988 IEEE""Working from a design is not a new concept in technical writing. However, we tend to associate the design of information from a style point of view; that is, how a manual will appear. But design can play an equally important role in managing documentation development, especially in large-scale projects. Many such projects involve different writers working on different components of the project; sometimes these writers are contractors who are isolated from those developing and managing the project, or are located in other areas of the country or world. To make everything work, there needs to be a design document detailing where the information will change in an existing set of manuals, specifically how it will change, and the common elements that everyone writing the documentation will share. This paper discusses the design document as a means of successfully managing documentation development. © 1991 IEEE""The commonsense principles of modern document design are direct descendants of the principles used in the Books of Hours, a hybridized religious instruction manual created in the commercial scriptoria of the 13th century. This article analyzes the design of Books of Hours and discusses how these medieval documents fit within the four design criteria (supertextual, extra-textual, intratextual, and intertextual) put forth by Kostelnick and Roberts [1]. The analysis reveals the early user of good document design features as the medieval scriptoria worked to address the audience and task requirements of the Books of Hours.""This article compares 1970 and 1990 versions of the U.S. Army publication: PS: The Preventive Maintenance Monthly. Visual communication becomes dated even more quickly than does textual communication. The later version of PS offers a visual design that has been toned down, tamed, subdued; what had been a visual rhetoric with clear (in hindsight) sexist assumptions has yielded to a rhetoric with more professional, more interracial, and more neutral assumptions that reflect the changed demands of contemporary culture. Nevertheless, a rhetoric of visual attractiveness will probably continue to exploit gender. The technical communicator's task is difficult because every attempt to neutralize gender bias is likely to fail (to some extent), for only the distance of time allows us to see sexism. © 1992 IEEE""The purpose of this study is to construct and validate a scale of electronic health (e-health) communication competence. Based on a comprehensive review of e-health literature, this scale was constructed using two studies to gather data and validate the scale; four dimensions emerged in the final measurement: e-health self-efficacy, knowledge, usage, and motivation. Results suggest the e-health competence scale is useful for researchers to develop online health interventions and other domains of computer-mediated communication. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Several information systems' and computer-mediated communication studies in the literature measure user's perceptions of email. The user's perceptions of email were used to develop and validate the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). While a user's perceptions of email play an important role in literature, very few studies have focused solely on developing a construct for measuring these perceptions. In this paper, we develop a construct to measure an individual's perceptions of email as a medium for electronic communication in organizations. Using a survey of management and nonmanagement employees in Northeastern US, we empirically test our theoretical construct. The results of our research indicate that an individual's perceptions of email are a multidimensional construct with two dimensions: the individual level dimension and the organizational level. At an individual level, a person's perceptions may be impacted by email's role in improving productivity, supporting team work, and providing global reach. At an organizational level a person's perceptions may be impacted by email's role in making an organization vulnerable to viruses, exposing proprietary information, and/or encouraging unprofessional and illegal behavior.""Open communication has been shown to be related to job satisfaction, organizational performance, and role clarity.

The proposed technical writing model is assessed against the results of a learner survey and refined accordingly. The survey showed that learners appreciated the cross-disciplinary collaboration in projects, and it delivered important insights into learning effects and student progress in both language and content matters. The article concludes with a list of recommendations for the implementation of project-based collaborative technical writing instruction, which may support or complement academic writing courses in similar contexts. The proposed model considers the circumstances of students in workload-intensive tertiary settings and synthesizes approaches such as problem-based learning, content-based instruction, task-based language teaching, a guided product approach to collaborative writing, and learner autonomy. © 2012, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Workplace ethics has become an increasingly important concern as both large and small companies emphasize ethical behavior, and schools and professional groups devote significant resources to ethics training.

Communicators who are operating from the state of ‘defensiveness’ tend to become physically tensed, discom fited, sped-up, gripped by the situation, estranged, mentally confused, and feel like striking out against the other person. “Feeling understood,” on the other hand, is characterized by feeling awakened, empowered, comforted, and want ing to move toward others. When communicators feel understood, they want to reach out; when they feel defensive, they want to strike out. When they feel understood they want to do something for the other person; when they feel defensive they want to do something to the other person. These two key contrasting communication conditions have greatly different implications for message sending and receiving behaviors. The core descriptions presented have heuristic and pedagogical value. © 1988, Sage Publications.

The interdisciplinary group for this case study collaborated to write a project proposal to solicit funds from the US government for constructing a test bed for immune buildings as a tactic for combating potential biological and chemical terrorist incidents. Their approach to collaboration coincided with several approaches previously addressed in professional and technical communication research Novel and creative approaches emerged as a result of this collaboration, but in some instances, disciplinary differences, as manifested by disputes over concepts and terminologies, posed obstacles to collaboration. Such challenges necessitated strong leadership, which was also critical for managing group process. © 2005 IEEE.""The University of Colorado at Denver's Internet Task Force has been conducting developmental research on the collaborative learning and participatory design process while creating and implementing the School of Education's Web page and mediated learning environment over the past three years.

As a result, unions, agencies, and operators engage in fiercely contested public debates over responsibility and authority when disasters occur. In proposing a three-dimensional model of accident analysis (both visual and verbal), this article illustrates how underlying models of causality influence the structure of technical reports and the nature of the argument over responsibility and authority in largescale technological disasters. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Im petus for using English instead of the previously-used Latin or French first came from the central government, which encouraged the use of English as a patriotic gesture during the war against France. Following this lead, writers of business letters eagerly switched to English but retained the highly formal letter writing style of the ars dictaminis. The surviving business letters from the period show a progressive discomfort with this style throughout the century and illustrate for us the dangers of relying on received rules in letter-writing. © 1980, Sage Publications.

The preliminary findings from this work were encouraging and indicate that a taxonomic approach makes it easy both for help providers to understand what information they need to supply, and for help users to find the help they need quickly. Part of this taxonomy of help content includes inside application messaging. Existing studies of on-line help messaging indicate that both user-initiated or system-initiated advice messaging can improve user efficiency by prompting users with information about what something on the interface is, what it does, or what to do once it has been activated. This study examines the placement of on-line help messages in a multiwindow software application on user performance. Subjects were automatically timed as they performed two sets of tasks: one where help messages always appeared at the bottom of an application's main window and one where help messages appeared at the bottom of the current window in focus (either the application's main window or a secondary popup window). Half of the subject group were shown one message location first; the other half were shown the second message location first. The results demonstrated that, while the order in which the subjects were provided the two messaging schemes was not significant, users performed significantly better when the messages were placed in the current window in focus, and that this performance decreased as the size of a secondary window with current fucus increased. Further, a majority of users showed a strong preference for help messages located in the current window in focus. © 1996 IEEE.""When an organization decides to adopt a technology, such as a content-management system (CMS), the choice affects writing styles and processes, and conversely, writing styles affect the implementation of the technology. This case study compares and contrasts the experiences of writers in organizations that implemented different types of CMSs: a web CMS (WCMS) and a component CMS (CCMS), with a focus on the different types of training given to each group to facilitate the implementations. Research questions: (1) What are the dependencies between technology choices and the corollary editorial constraints that writers must consider in order to realize the benefits that the technology can bring? (2) What types of training are needed to ensure that writers become fully productive in a collaborative, structured-authoring environment? Situating the case: When adopting structured information technologies, such as CMS, organizations seek to reduce costs and improve efficiencies through the reuse and better management of content components, such as text and images, which can significantly reduce the costs of translation, reproduction, and maintenance of publications. Structured information technologies, such as a CMS, Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Darwin Information Technology Architecture (DITA) affect technical communicators by changing writing styles to a more structured, topic-based approach, by introducing new tools and concepts for authoring and publishing, and by requiring more involvement in the selection, use, and maintenance of the technologies. Previous efforts to address these issues through training include works by Critchlow, who addressed the use of database systems to address challenges in developing documentation in collaborative environments; Edgell, who related how technical communicators proposed a CMS-based documentation solution to a software firm; and Lanier, who described how one organization overcame the resistance to new structured information technologies by writers. Methodology: The case was studied as an experience report by one of this article's authors (Bailie), in which the organizations engaged a consultant during their CMS implementation projects. The observations are qualitative and reflect consulting engagements with two teams over a period of almost three years. About the case: A common problem in implementing CMSs is interdependencies between content structures, on which the technology depends, and the editorial changes required to ensure that the content is best structured to take full advantage of the capabilities of the technology chosen. This case describes a four-phase training process provided to two clients: one with several contributors to the content-management effort in a single location; the other with more than a dozen contributors in several locations. Each client received four phase of training: (1) theoretical training - understanding pertinent theories behind good content development; (2) application of theory - how to apply the theories to their workplace; (3) software training - learning the new software to produce the content; (4) production - support immediately following training, during implementation. The results of the training were to increase the skill levels of the writers to understand how to leverage content in powerful ways using sophisticated technology. Conclusions: Determine the production needed for the content when choosing a class of CMS to address those production needs. Afterwards, match the training of the writers to the complexity of the system. Content strategists, project managers, technical communicators, and others involved in implementing a CMS need to allow sufficient time and training for writers to adjust their skills to the new technology and the new processes and techniques required to effectively use them. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This study explored the relationship between compliance gaining strategy choice, communicator image, and salesperson effectiveness.

This study discusses the relationship between secondary and primary product characteristics and provides the results of a customer survey of computer hardware end-users. Over 500 respondents (or customers) were surveyed regarding the impact of documentation on customers' perception of product quality. The results of a logistic regression showed that the level of satisfaction with documentation plays a critical role in explaining customer satisfaction with primary product quality. Consequently, before organizations make decisions regarding cuts in documentation, they should carefully evaluate documentation's effects on company performance. Implications for practice and research are also provided, with follow-up and complementary studies suggested. © 1996 IEEE.""Reports that moderately frequent headings led to higher comprehension for one sample and to beliefs about more new knowledge gained for the other sample* Discusses the role of content familiarity in comprehension""This article describes research that studied how heading frequency affects comprehension and perceptions of information in print versus online text. The results of this study indicate that heading frequency did not significantly affect the comprehension of readers of print text, while it did significantly affect the comprehension of readers of online text, who had considerably lower comprehension scores with text that had high-frequency versus medium-frequency headings. Although more research is needed, these results remind technical communicators that their readers will comprehend text differently between the two media. The study also highlights the fact that we cannot assume that guidelines for the design of print-based information automatically transfer to the design of online information.""When document designers localize documents for readers in other cultures, they should consider what text organization will best suit those readers. The study presented here examines American and Japanese readers' comprehension of and preference for expository text that contains a thesis and is organized either inductively or deductively.

Process structuration (Giddens, 1979, 1984; Poole, Seibold, & McPhee, 1985) provides a theoretical framework by which we can understand group processes and outcomes. This study examines the effects of process structuration by means of a training video on maintenance behavior and outcomes in 55 different student virtual decision-making groups from two universities. Results show that trained groups had higher levels of social support, greater participation rates, and greater satisfaction with the group; wasted less time and energy; and made significantly more accurate judgments. We discuss implications for the impact of this type of training on virtual groups and suggest further research. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study employed a quasiexperimental control group design in a university setting to test the effect of a rater-training program on reducing social style bias in intragroup peer evaluations after controlling for ability based on GPA.

This study examines a system that incorporates system-initiated online help to advise users of shortcuts for menu navigation. Subjects received either no advice messages or one of three advice message types, varying in timing and specificity, and subjects were assessed on their subsequent use of shortcuts. Results revealed that users who receive system-initiated advice take greater advantage of shortcuts and are able to complete their work more quickly than users who receive no system-initiated advice messages. Further, a majority of users reacted positively to the messages, finding them helpful in introducing shortcuts. © 1992 IEEE""This article looks at how two offices changed their informal work relationships and patterns in response to a major technological innovation in their field.

This study found that none of the tested crisis response strategies were helpful in reducing public blame surrounding the featured organization's responsibility in the crisis. This study also found that the presence of crisis itself tends to negatively affect the relationship quality and that the publics examined were not influenced by the use of crisis response strategies. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication."Both the function and the appearance of annual reports have changed over the last few decades. These multimodal reports now include many types of information that serve different functions. In this study, the effects of several information types on stakeholders' attitudes toward annual reports and the companies that published them are measured. Literature review: Not much is known about how stakeholders read annual reports. The literature is not conclusive on the relative importance of several information types in these reports. Most studies investigate the impact of part of the information in annual reports and ignore the combined impact of the information types. Whether the potential investors are more affected by the financial review, the future strategy narrative or by pictures, such as a picture of the CEO, is unknown. Methodology: An experiment (2× 2 ×2 between subjects design) was conducted to test the effects of a good financial review versus a poor one, a good future strategy versus a poor one and a picture of the CEO smiling versus that with a serious facial expression. The effects on potential stakeholders' attitudes toward the information, on their attitudes toward investing in the company, and on their perceptions of the corporate reputation are measured. Results and conclusion: The results show significant effects of all three information types. A good financial review, a good future strategy, and a serious facial expression have beneficial effects on the potential stakeholders' attitudes and on the corporate reputation. More important, however, the results show that the information types should be aligned with each other. A smiling facial expression, for example, is only beneficial if the content of the other information types is good. © 2014 IEEE.""A laboratory experiment investigated how the dimensionality of computer-generated graphs affects users' abilities to extract information from the graphs. Two-dimensional graphs were found to be more reliable in communicating information quickly and accurately than corresponding three-dimensional graphs. A surprising finding was that a commonly used, but technically incorrect, three-dimensional graph performed better than its corrected version. © 1994, Sage Publications.

To determine whether gender differences in this organization were stable or context dependent, competing hypotheses were established from both structural and socialization perspectives. Significant main effects of gender and employee classification level were predicted and found by structuralist theory. Women reported lower job satisfaction and interaction as less desirable than men, whereas hourly workers reported lower supervisory support, teamwork, communication satisfaction, and accuracy of information than salaried workers. Structuralist theory also predicted and found significant interaction effects for satisfaction with communication, supervisory support, teamwork, and desire for interaction. However, both theories operated for employees’ perceptions of information accuracy. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Information Technology (IT) organizations devote the necessary resources to equip and train engineering, marketing, and sales teams, but often fail to do so for technical documentation teams. Many IT organizations tend to view documentation as an afterthought; however, consumers of IT products frequently base their purchasing decisions on the end user documentation's content, layout, and presentation. Documentation teams play a unique role in IT organizations as they help to build and create a public identity through end user manuals and the corporate website, as well as maintain intellectual knowledge through knowledge sharing and management. The technical communicator ""makes sense"" of complex engineering specifications by creating user-friendly manuals for the layman. The practitioner who compiles and records this complex information is a valuable resource to any IT organization. Therefore, on-going training for technical documentation teams is essential to stay competitive in the fast-paced technical market. Technical communicators in IT organizations who only write end user manuals are becoming a rarity. Research indicates a marked trend toward technical writers in multiple roles and varied responsibilities that include web design and development, and business systems analysis functions. Although these added roles and responsibilities require training on some of the newer software tools and more complex programming tools, technical communicators are experiencing difficulty keeping pace with these tools. This article discusses technical documentation teams in IT organizations and provides an on-going training assessment to help technical documentation managers identify their team's strengths and weaknesses. In addition, measures and results from a study conducted at eight IT organizations, are provided to show the effect of how the integration of on-going training for documentation teams enhances individual competency and improves team performance.""Should instructional texts be purely technical, with a focus on effectiveness and efficiency, or should they also focus on satisfying and motivating users? Good arguments have been made for paying attention to motivational aspects. But only analyses of existing instructions have been published so far, and guidelines for making user instructions motivational have not yet been studied carefully. This article presents motivational strategies and an experiment to test their effects. The results show that motivational elements have little effect on users' effectiveness and efficiency in performing tasks, their product appreciation, and their self-efficacy, but they do increase users' appreciation for the instructions. © 2006 Sage Publications.""The effect of the Open and Dominant communication styles from Norton's (1978) dimensions were tested on judgments and perceptions of sales effectiveness. Eighty students in small groups viewed pretested videotapes of a sales interaction; each tape depicted one of the four combinations of communicator style dimensions (high and low levels of Openness and Dominance). After viewing the tape, subjects completed a 42-item questionnaire from which six composite scores were created. Using a 2 x 2 ANOVA design, four of these composites showed significant effects: (1) Perceptions of the product being sold, (2) the interaction between the salesperson and customer in the tape, (3) Probability of purchase of the product in the tape and (4) Perceptions of the salesperson being depicted in the tape. Respondents, in general, rated the high Dominant /low Open and low Dominant /high Open salesperson more favorably than the high Dominant / high Open or Low Dominant /low Open salesperson. These results are addressed in terms of the sales interaction and as a heuristic for future research. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Text media technology affects all areas of the law, from its intellectual basis to its promulgation, dissemination and enforcement. From America's Colonial period, the operative state of the art of printing has accordingly shaped the development of the law in America, and has caused it to grow in a different direction from the law of England. Since the Colonial period, the state of the art of text media technology has made quantum evolutionary leaps forward, impacting American law in the process. Artifacts of these text media technologies are to be found in the statutes, legislative histories, judicial decisions, and other legal materials. Modern technology has accelerated the pace of text media technology development, and has impacted the law accordingly. Current developments continue to impact the law on an ongoing basis, and future developments in text media technology can be expected to leave their impact upon the law. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This study shows that race/ethnicity significantly explained differences in attitudes toward human resource policies fostering diversity held by faculty at a large public university in the midwestern United States. Overall, whites’ attitudes were less positive regarding diversity programs and other human resource policies relevant to women and minorities than Black’s, Hispanic’s, and Asian’s attitudes were. We also found that individual race and ethnicity significantly explained differences in attitudes toward diversity programs to a greater extent than the demography of the organizational work unit. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The findings of the 200 full-time working adults who participated in the study supported prior research indicating positive relationships between mentoring behaviors by supervisors and their subordinates' communication satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction, and negative relationships between supervisors' verbal aggression and their subordinates' communication satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction. Results of a regression analysis indicated that supervisors' verbal aggression was a greater negative predictor of subordinates' outcomes than was mentoring a positive predictor, supporting the presence of a negativity bias in the supervisor-subordinate relationship. Additionally, path analysis indicated that communication satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between supervisor mentoring and subordinate organizational commitment, whereas communication satisfaction served as a suppressor between mentoring and subordinate job satisfaction. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Due to globalization and the increased availability of online collaboration tools, individuals are now likely to work together in settings where computers are their primary mode of communication. However, because communication characteristics are different in virtual team settings, especially when they are text based, communication problems, such as deception, arise. Recent research found that deceptive individuals in virtual teams can have a negative impact on group task performance, and it recognized that in addition to the communication medium, task and group characteristics, such as task complexity and group member experience, are important influences in these settings. However, the impacts of these additional influences have not been empirically examined. Research question: Does group members' experience with each other and task complexity affect their deception detection accuracy and task performance in a computer-mediated communication setting? Literature review: Previous literature has shown that deceivers are an important influence on computer-mediated groups. However, few studies have compared different group settings, and no studies have empirically tested the impact that task and group characteristics, such as task complexity and group member experience, have on these types of groups. Methodology: An experiment was designed to test the effect of group member experience and task complexity on computer-mediated groups facing deception. Two-hundred fifty-six undergraduates (256) were selected for the experiment. Results and conclusions: Quantitative analysis, which included multivariate analysis of variance, revealed that (a) groups performing a low-complexity task were better at detecting deception than were groups performing a high-complexity task, (b) groups with members who had experience with each other had higher task performance than did inexperienced groups, and (c) experienced groups did not have higher accuracy in detecting deception than did inexperienced groups. These results highlight the importance of understanding the different affects that task complexity and group member experience have on virtual teams facing deception, and they provide insight into what practices can help minimize the impact of interactive computer-mediated deception. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Writing tutors often have very little or no expertise in conventions of engineering writing. In this study, I examine the topics and politeness strategies of tutors' comments, investigating how non-expertise in engineering writing decreases the effectiveness of tutors' interactions with engineering students. I show how the three non-expert tutors gave inappropriate advice and often stated their advice with certainty. I also show how a tutor with expertise in engineering writing gave specific and useful guidance to her tutee and built rapport with him as well. I outline how writing tutors could be trained to help better engineering students. © 2004 IEEE.""Many people have speculated over the last 80 years or so about the possibilities of using colored paper to boost response-rates to surveys and questionnaires, and several studies have been carried out. Most of these enquiries report no significant effects from using colored paper, although there have been some exceptions. In this investigation we pooled together the results from all of the experimental studies known to us on the topic and we carried out a meta-analysis to see if there might be a positive effect for colored paper overall. The results indicated that this was not the case, for we found no significant differences between the response rates to white and to colored paper in general. However, when we considered separately the most common colors used, it appeared that pink paper had the greatest effect.""This study on computer-mediated deception features an experiment involving an interactive interview of deceitful applicants for a fictitious scholarship, using one of three different computer-based communication media. Results showed that people were successful at deceiving others no matter what medium was used, but interviewers who used interactive, as opposed to non-interactive, media probed interviewees more during the interviews. Probing led to better lie detection. Also, interviewers who had received simple warnings about the possible presence of deception were better at detecting deception than were interviewers who had received no warnings. However, warnings alone were not sufficient to increase interviewers' probing. © 2008 IEEE.""Over the years, a number of systems have been developed or adapted for use in grading the work of students in written business communication courses. Although the “perfect” system most likely has not been developed, a number of those currently used fulfill theirgoal of helping students become more profi cientwriters. Some systems undoubtedly fulfill their goal more effectively than others, however. Regardless of which feedback system an instructor uses, he/she needs to be aware of its advantages and disadvantages as well as ways to maximize its effectiveness.

It also investigates message types and communication medium preferences. Using a between-subjects design, the experiment compares two student groups: SMS only and non-SMS. The results indicated several statistically significant differences. Compared to students in the non-SMS group, students in the SMS-only group (a) communicated more, (b) felt more connected, and (c) sent more questions, answers, and nonproject-related messages. These results provide empirical evidence for using SMS in team contexts. © The Author(s) 2012.""One's openness to, and ability to cope with, change are measured by the acid test for publication specialists described here.

Metaphors often serve as the basis of invention for scientific theories. When we identify these metaphors in Planck's original 1900 quantum paper, it is clear that Planck did consider the quantum postulate to be important. However, we also see that he does not consider the quantum postulate to be revolutionary.""This study presents analytical research that explores the form and function of written business communication on a U.S.-Mexico border through a combined method of descriptive and context-sensitive rhetorical text analysis. Data comprise documents (letters, proposals, invoices) from a Mexican company that operates on both sides of the border and communicates in both English and Spanish. Documents were analyzed through multiple passes for identifiable linguistic and rhetorical patterns in the areas of purpose, audience, style, and organization, paying close attention to those traits typically ascribed to Mexican business discourse. Findings of this study suggest that professionals on this U.S.-Mexico border are adopting, and adapting to, shared communicative standards and practices in business communication. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""It may be considered propaganda!

This lack of attention grows more apparent as document design becomes ""information design."" Since Katz discerned an ""ethic of expediency"" in Nazi technical writing, scholars have often framed technical communication ethics in categorical terms. Yet analyses of information design must consider why arrangements of text and graphics have symbolic potency for given cultures. An ""ethic of exigence"" can be seen in an example of Nazi information design, a 1935 racial-education poster that illustrates how designers and users co-constructed a communally validated meaning. This example supports the postmodern view that ethics must account for naturalized authority as well as individual actions. © The Author(s) 2010.""Strategic ambiguity is a prevalent and valuable tactic in organizational communication. However, the deniability of strategically ambiguous messages, and the resulting utility of strategic ambiguity for escaping blame, may limit its usefulness for ethical communication in organizations. This article addresses the ethics of strategic ambiguity from an intrapersonal perspective that considers the congruity of communicators' espoused-ethics, ethics-in-use, and behavior. When communicators espouse a rational, logically consistent ethical system, judgments can be made about the ethicality of communicative behaviors. Ethical judgments are based on the congruity between espoused-ethics and actual behavior. The distinctive value of this approach is that regardless of differences in ethical systems among communicators, judgments of ethicality are based only on the particular ethical systems espoused and used by individuals. Communicators who are unable to espouse a coherent moral philosophy upon which their actions are based should consider alternatives to strategic ambiguity. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""Ethics and technical communication have a long history. Much of the discussion has ignored, though, the evil in language-overnaming. We see clearest this evil in what some have called ""administrative evil."" Technical communicators, like all good rhetoricians, need to understand how to respond to it. Overnaming as part of ""administrative evil"" is that evil which grounds all other evils. It is a certain understanding of language and what naming can do. When we overname, we try to control words to mean one thing eternally. Rhetoric is a move of renaming those words that have been overnamed. Such invention is needed as part of any rhetorical education for technical communicators. © The Author(s) 2015."This paper examines several aspects of communication vehicles and the various types of progress that have been made over the years.

Drawing on qualitative interviews with Finnish and Chinese business professionals, the authors examine the effect of cultural identity on the directness of the communication of Chinese professionals who work for internationally operating Finnish companies located in Beijing and Shanghai, China, and who use English as the shared language with their Finnish colleagues. Three components of cultural identity (i.e., vocation as an international business professional, fairly young age, and the use of English as the business lingua franca) are particularly relevant in the participants' professional communication and stimulated its openness and directness. The study finds that the evolution of English as the business lingua franca can be detected in the signs of convergence identified in Chinese and Finnish professional communication. © The Author(s) 2013.""This article extends earlier studies examining the core competencies of technical communicators. Our project updates these previous perspectives by analyzing the broad range of information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal traits requested by industry job advertisements. The analysis seeks to answer three main questions: • What genre/information product knowledge is important for success in the technical communication job market? • What technology skills are essential for success in the technical communication job market? • What professional competencies and personal characteristics are essential for success in the technical communication job market? Method: We analyzed almost 1,000 U.S. technical communication job postings from Monster.com. We mined the postings for position title, job type, education level, experience level, location, salary, and industry sector. We subsequently conducted a content analysis of the job descriptions, using open coding to identify information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal characteristics. Results: The job postings exhibited enormous variety in position titles but fell into five main categories: Content Developer/Manager, Grant/Proposal Writer, Medical Writer, Social Media Writer, and Technical Writer/Editor. Information products and technology skills varied substantially with job type. The job postings showed some differentiation in professional competencies across job categories, but they also revealed competencies that were common to all categories. Conclusion: Technical communication positions now encompass a wide range of audiences, content, contexts, and media. The jobs data illustrate the breadth of products and competencies that drive the field. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

Many studies have explored how this ""silent speech"" affects the reading process. As a follow-up to a previous article about applying a phonological reading model to technical communication, this article proposes that educators and practitioners of technical communication would benefit greatly from a thorough understanding of the speech instinct. Therefore, the author explores the speech instinct, how humans developed it, and how it has been and still is fostered by reading behavior and pedagogy.""Our view of ethics in professional and technical communication has evolved, paralleling developments throughout society. Earlier views on ethics and values have grown into a broad perspective of complex gradations with people at many levels affecting eventual practical outcomes. This newer perspective includes not only persons but social forces and organizations. The organizational culture of NASA, for example, was specifically identified by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) as one of the causes of faulty communication leading to a terribly tragic event. The Challenger investigations of 20 years earlier, on the other hand, focused primarily on physical events, secondarily on professional judgments, and only little on the social and cultural context of the disaster. We learn by failures but also by self-examination. As we see how ethics and values impact technical events, we understand that technological progress is ultimately a human endeavor in which reflection and judgment is as important as measurement and observation. © 2007 IEEE.""Presenting the correct written information to a business decision maker in the appropriate form is often critical to the success of the project.

It enabled technical communicators without formal education in the field to gain important knowledge, provided a forum for communicators from different industries to meet in order to solve mutual problems, played a key role in defining the field and its needs, encouraged recruitment (including the hiring of more women), promoted professional societies and formal degree programs, and seriously affected industry training programs by enabling them to use institute teaching materials. Knowledge gained through the Technical Writers' Institute enabled Rensselaer to develop many other innovations. © 2009 SAGE Publications.""An audience pays attention to your attempts at communication because they have certain needs that they expect you to solve. As journalists have long known, it's possible to meet the majority of an audience's need for information by answering five ""W"" questions: what, who, where, when, and why. Although this approach is a core element of journalism, it has obvious applications for technical communicators, who must create information in the context of meeting an audience's needs.""Business, like many other programs in higher education, continues to rely largely on traditional classroom environments.

It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that the theoretical and empirical knowledge of their nature has remained somewhat elusive. This paper describes a theoretical framework for procedures, summarized as the four components model, which is grounded in systems theory and rhetoric. The study addresses two research questions: (1) What are procedures made of? and (2) Which design guidelines for procedures can be abstracted from theory and research? The model distinguishes between: goals, prerequisite states, unwanted states (warnings and problem-solving information), and actions and reactions. For each component pertinent research findings are summarized and lead to the formulation of design guidelines. Occasionally these guidelines are compared with existing procedures from a sample of 104 manuals to see how well theory and practice agree. The model offers a manageable and expandable framework for creating user support that is based on scientific research. It can be used for a systematic analysis of procedures and for their (re)design.""This corpus comparison study examines the occurrences of just as used in British and New Zealand engineering lectures in order to discover its frequency and functions and to consider its role in professional communication. Research questions: Is just as frequent in the academic genre of university lectures as in other genres of spoken English? (1) Does just have the same functions in British and New Zealand engineering lectures as found in a previous study at an American university? (2) Does a better understanding of the different ways that just is used in lectures have pedagogical implications for professional communication, especially for English as an additional language learners? Literature review: Previous studies show just mainly functions as a ''minimizer'' (merely, only, simply) in university lectures in America, and functions the same in British and New Zealand university lectures on engineering. Just also functions as part of a metadiscursive frame (let me just explain), and stance (the speaker's attitude toward the content communicated: don't just copy down what I've done). In response, English as an additional language learners can learn to recognize and distinguish the different functions of just and use them appropriately. Methodology: The researcher used a corpus linguistics methodology to determine the frequency of just and a discourse analysis method to see if the functions of just identified in a previous study of the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English applied to the corpus of British and New Zealand engineering lectures. These lectures are all part of the Engineering Lecture Corpus, which was started at Coventry University and includes AUT University in New Zealand. Results and discussion: The frequency of just in British and New Zealand engineering lectures was high: it occurred in the top 50 words in the wordlists of both sets of lectures. Just was used in British and New Zealand engineering lectures the same way as in the American university, functioning mostly as a 'minimizer,' often to reduce the imposition of what was being said or asked. It occurred much more frequently in the British engineering lectures than the New Zealand ones, often in short stretches of discourse. Its 'locative' meaning, used when indicating a precise location, occurred more often in the New Zealand Electrical Engineering lectures and in the British Civil Engineering lectures. A study of the different ways that just functions, and the frequency with which it is used in spoken academic English should lead to a better understanding of its function in professional communication. The limitation of the study was the sample size, and the fact that it was an opportunistic sample taken from a limited number of lecturers in a limited number of universities. While adopting the functions used in the American study was a limitation, the additional category of just used in multiword units was uncovered. Limitations of the unavailablilty of recordings to determine pronunciation differences was also noted, with examples provided to show possible misunderstandings. Future research would examine an expanded data sample, providing better representation of the language of lectures in the UK and New Zealand within and outside the subdisciplines of engineering, and investigating the ways that the pronunciation of just affects its meaning. Other spoken academic and general corpora, such as the British Academic Spoken English corpus and the spoken components of the British National Corpus and the Corpus of Contemporary American English could be studied for comparison purposes of the frequency and functions of just. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""The accounting profession has called for increased attention to communica tion skill development in accounting curricula. Since independent accountants rely extensively on client communications when gathering evidence during external audits, identifying and minimizing communication barriers with clients can improve audit efficiency and effectiveness. This study evaluated client perceptions of the seriousness and frequency of potential communica tion barriers in external audits. Factor analysis revealed both a credibility/background factor and hostility/conflict factor to be the most seri ous barriers. Subjects perceived personality differences, “know-it-all” attitude, “either-or” thinking, resistance to change, and jumping to conclusions as occurring most frequently. © 1997, Sage Publications.

Specifically, formulaic compliments like ""It's good"" function differently from nonformulaic compliments like ""The size is excellent in terms of visually aiding the reader."" A total of 107 compliments were analyzed from 13 interactions between 12 writing tutors and 12 engineering students. About 61% of tutors' compliments followed one of six formulae, and about 39% were nonformulaic. Formulaic compliments were general and mainly performed a phatic function, filling pauses and avoiding silence, particularly in interaction closings. Nonformulaic compliments were more specific and individualized, and they may, therefore, be more instructive than formulaic compliments. Nonformulaic compliments also performed an exploratory function, allowing participants to renegotiate discourse status. This study points to other avenues of research, particularly research that systemically examines writers' perceptions of formulaic and nonformulaic feedback, such as compliments. © 2006 IEEE.""Reports results of a practitioner survey on the definition of technical communication and the role of technology in their work* Argues that technical communication demonstrates a stable set of core values which suggest the field has a professional identity""Presents results of a 2003 survey with influential practitioners on innovation, global concerns, management, the impact of new technologies, and future professional roles* Provides recommendations for the future focus of the profession""Considers how tools and technologies affect the documentation process and the profession* Addresses the impact of softer skills such as project management* Points to the need for future research on ""what might be"" in the future""Previews the arguments of the articles in this special issue* Suggests that our profession is in the midst of a disruption much like that affecting small retailers throughout the U.S. because of Internet technologies""Much knowledge work involves temporary work teams. Increasingly, these teams are not face-to-face but virtual teams. This paper explores the gender impact of virtual collaboration as compared to face-to-face teams. Descriptive statistics are used to show the different perceptions of the group experience based on gender and on face-to-face versus virtual team experiences. Women in the virtual groups perceived that the group stuck together more and helped each other more than did the men. Also, the women were more satisfied with the virtual group than men and felt that group conflict was readily resolved. In comparing the experience of women in the virtual groups to women in the face-to-face groups, the face-to-face women were less satisfied with the group experience than their virtual counterparts and perceived that conflict was smoothed over.""This study examines the generic structure of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, which are becoming standard practice for corporate communication of social and environmental performance beyond financial disclosure. Literature review: Genre theories provide a framework for exploring genres contextualized in different cultures. Based on the English for Specific Purposes approach of genre analysis, this study compares the move structure of CSR reports in Italian, Chinese, and English from a corpus-based perspective. Research questions: 1. What are the main moves used in CSR reports? 2. Are there any cross-cultural similarities or variations in terms of generic features? Methodology: Combining genre theories with concepts from Systemic Functional Linguistics, we designed an observational framework for move identification. Based on a 15-move scheme, we annotated 18 CSR reports for comparative analysis. Results and conclusions: The CSR report is characterized by rhetorical recursivity and hybridity of speech acts: Beyond 'reporting' and 'presenting,' it is also 'demonstrating,' 'evaluating,' and 'committing.' As a globally established genre, it presents noticeable generic similarity in different languages, suggesting that the communicative purposes of CSR reports are recognized by different cultures. The top six moves in the Performance-reporting section of the CSR reports present identical trends in terms of extensiveness ranking in all three languages. Cross-cultural variations mainly involve the use of optional moves, such as the dominant use of the move 'Presenting individual cases' in the Chinese sample. The observational framework for move identification may also be transferable to other genres. The limitations of this study include the sample size and the absence of an author survey. Future research could investigate the CSR report from a diachronic perspective, to explore how its genre structure has developed over time. © 2017 IEEE.""Focusing on the case write-up within the Harvard case method of instruction, this study provides historical and empirical evidence for the theory of genre systems. The Harvard case literature and interviews at a case-based business school in the Harvard tradition show that the purpose of this largely ignored written genre is to prepare students to participate in the primary genre, oral classroom discussion of the case. The case genre system provides highly conventionalized conductor-choreographer roles for instructors and blunt, detached consultant roles for student writers/speakers who repeatedly enact decisive, adversarial personae affirming practices and values of the business school.""Globalization is constantly in the news these days, and the subtext—-if not the overt message—-is often negative. The proposed European Union constitution was rejected by French and Dutch voters last summer because of concern over the loss of national identity and fear that open borders encourage immigrants willing to work for low wages. At the same time, globalization seems to be an unstoppable force in the business world. So how does globalization affect technical communication as a profession and the Society for Technical Communication as an organization?""Instituted as a regular part of the GMAT in October 1994, the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) has the potential to serve as a diagnostic tool in MBA programs. This article describes the new test and reviews the uses of the AWA scores and essays that have significant ramifications for management communication. It concludes by suggesting why it is vital for communication instructors to become involved in decisions about how to use the AWA results. © by the Association for Business Communication.""This article uses a historical perspective to describe the development of the profession of technical communication through three ages: Brass, Beige, and Glass. I compare this development to the growth of the academic discipline and both to the explosion of noninstitutional technical communication-the growing body of tactical technical communication that happens outside of organizations and institutions. This leads me to describe today as the Golden Age of technical communication. I conclude that we should broaden the scope of technical communication and spread it as a set of skills valuable for everyone to learn. © The Author(s) 2016."The problem of predicting what will remain unchanged in language-usage rules is addressed. An explanation for which certain rules will remain unchanged is proposed."The graphic novel provides an attractive medium to communicate business concepts with a number of characteristics that may aid student learning in a more effective manner than traditional textbooks. The authors provide an overview of the graphic novel format and use McLuhan's research on ""hot"" versus ""cool"" media as a theoretical base that highlights how and why this format can be a useful tool to present management content relevant for the current generation of business students. The authors provide examples of how the graphic novel medium could be applied to business concepts and conclude with an agenda for future empirical research. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""There is a fundamental conflict between controlling the dissemination of scientific and technical data, and promoting openness and peer review of the data. This paper focuses on the control of unclassified scientific and technical data for national security purposes. It explains the reasons for such controls, the federal government's policies and the reaction to those policies, and how some foreign governments deal with this problem. Finally, it summarizes and evaluates the arguments for and against controls, and presents some recommendations for the current administration. © 1989 IEEE""The authors argue that both small group and writing processes are involved in the writing of group reports.

Rather than simply focusing on the mechanics of language, editors of the series fostered in students a set of literacies that would help them cope with the tumultuous change in 19th-century China. This study suggests that the experience of 19th-century textbook editors may inform our approach to complex intercultural communication challenges in today’s globalized world. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.""Modern rhetoricians George Campbell, Hugh Blair, and Richard Whately set forth the fundamentals of writing between 1776 and 1828. These fundamentals were then adopted—and improved upon—by nineteenth and early twentieth century rhetoric and composition authors. In 1916 George Burton Hotchkiss wrote the first important college business communication textbook. Improving further on the fundamentals of writing—and using the “you attitude” and the “Cs” as reminders—he emphasized the necessity of taking the reader's point of view and of following the “great” rhetorical principles of unity, coherence, and force. © 1994, Sage Publications.

It is well known that digital technology produces a ""digital divide."" In addition, it is well examined that the digital divide produces cognitive differences (e.g., knowledge gaps) among users. Yet, little is known about affective disparities. In addition, few studies on the digital divide were undertaken in organizational setting. This study considers the human side of the digital divide in an organizational setting and investigates if the digital divide exists in the workplace by examining multiple dimensions of communication satisfaction. The data from 303 university employees indicates that email experience differentiates communication satisfaction with amount of email and email use for equivocal tasks. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The International Communication Association (ICA) Communication audit provides an organization with advance information that may prevent major breakdowns.

By showing how producers of computer interfaces rely on the possibility of multiple interpretive trajectories in the use of any sign and how users of such signs respond in ways that are far from being totally predictable, we argue that it is best to think of the communication act not as a simple exchange of information between two minds (producer and user) but rather as a field of possibilities that requires flexibility and an experimental attitude from both the producer and the user. Examining theoretical developments in the history of physics and cognitive science, we contend that the dominant paradigms of understanding communication—the old cognitive (or computational) model and the social constructionist model as currently employed in the fields of composition and technical communication—fall short of accounting for even fairly straightforward exchanges of information. In place of the communication triangle that both of the old models rely upon, we offer a new model that uses the concept of “consensual domains” as the basis for a general theory of rhetoric. As a starting point for our investigation, we present the history of a still evolving sign—the trash can icon in the user interface of the Macintosh operating system—from the perspective of a single (also still evolving) human user. © 1995 IEEE.""Ideological questions (that is, theoretical questions about the way in which language shapes our perceptions) are often ignored in technical writing classes. This essay explores how conventional classroom approaches to the discussion of the organization and theory of information can be expanded rather easily into full-scale explorations of the ideology of the language of scientific and technical writing. Technical descriptions from biology, engineering, and physics are used to provide hands-on examples of this ideological approach. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To investigate differences in user perceptions of commercial and official manuals, we conducted two studies: one focusing on user expectations and one on user experiences. Method: The first study was an online experiment, in which two groups of participants answered questions about their expectations of a (commercial or official) manual. The second study was a 2×2 experiment, with perceived source (commercial or official) and the actual content of the instructions (commercial or official) as independent variables, and task performance and users’ judgments as dependent variables. Results: The first study showed that users have different expectations of commercial and official manuals, and overall think more positively about a commercial manual. The second study showed that perceived source had a significant effect on task performance: Participants worked better when they thought they used a commercial manual. No differences were found regarding participants’ judgments of the manual. Conclusion: Our research indicates a potential image problem of official user manuals. Even though we found no evidence for a lower quality of the official manual’s content, users’ relatively negative expectations of an official manual may discourage them from using the official user instructions. The second study showed that the perceived source (commercial/official) may even affect the actual task performance of users. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Although the two groups received identical training in negotiation styles, they retained key differences in terms of topic allocation, verbal immediacy, and topic progression; the Spanish were substantially more people-oriented, whereas the Danish were substantially more task-oriented. These results suggest that the two groups of negotiators would view each other's negotiating styles critically because of the differences in their cultural styles. © 1994 IEEE.""New communication technologies, based on the computer, will change the ways in which texts are written and produced. Most of these changes will re strict the writing process. While the most noticeable innovation has been the word processor, purely electronic information will soon introduce more potent challenges into the writer's task. This movement from paper-based informa tion to electronic, or online, information requires the writer to consider interaction methods, layout features, screen functions, and the like. It also re quires a reevaluation of the reader's relation to the traditional concept of “texts” and calls into question many writing strategies. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Dividing the sample on the basis of perceived decoding ability and gender revealed several differences between the groups. Nonverbal communication was more important to self-rated good decoders than to other decoders. Better decoders relied most on facial expressions for accurate information while less skilled decoders preferred voice level or tone. Women, individually, rated themselves higher than men in decoding ability and, as a group, were perceived by both men and women to be better decoders and encoders of nonverbal cues. Women working in the education field rated themselves higher in decoding ability than any other group. Recommendations for improved communication in businesses included paying more at tention to nonverbal cues, especially the facial expressions, engaging in more eye contact, and probing for more information when verbal and nonverbal cues are discrepant. Managers should be aware that most employees feel frustration and distrust when receiving conflicting signals from their supervisors, and should try to modify their behavior by being more honest when communicating their emotions. © 1991, Sage Publications.

Like many social communities, these subdisciplines have found websites of federal funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) to be an effective and efficient home in which to solidify that identity and communicate those values. Despite the lack of collaborative, Web 2.0 technologies, the sites of NSF and NIH are able to communicate the ethics of the science communities they serve through rhetorical structures as diverse as graphics, page layout, and site structures. This article explores that role of NSF and NIH, including the rhetoric used, the ethics presented, and their broader implications.""This commentary describes and critiques criteria that, according to results from an Association for Business Communication (ABC) member survey, are having an impact on quality judgments about our journals. ABC members rank the Journal of Business Communication and Business Communication Quarterly as top research and pedagogical journals in business/management communication, a finding corroborated by a larger study of academics in business and technical communication. However, the growing importance of citation counts and journal rankings currently disadvantages our journals, presenting us with professional obligations and personal dilemmas in relation to them. The authors' purpose is to raise awareness of the various determinants of perceptions of journal quality, to explore the communal views of ABC members on this issue, and to seek ways of enhancing the value of business/management communication research in the academic marketplace. © 2007 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study investigates important questions for any emerging high-technology firm attempting to obtain funding: Does the design of the presentation and the perceived passion and preparedness of the presenter influence expert reviewers' assessment of the merits of the firm's proposal? The authors analyzed 22 videotaped presentations to reviewer panels at a U.S. Department of Defense technology transfer consortium and compared the panels' assessments of the presenting firms' proposals both before and after the formal presentations. The data showed that, on average, higher levels of perceived entrepreneurial passion and presenter preparedness and presentation designs that effectively captured the audiences' attention resulted in higher ratings by decision makers on the firm's technology merit, management ability, and commercial potential. © The Author(s) 2013.""Asynchronous-distributed (AD) collaborative writing (CW) is an important form of the growing trend of distributed work. However, AD CW typically results in multiple process losses. We argue that using advanced writing technologies designed for AD work alone is not sufficient by itself to overcome these losses. Instead, adopting high levels of process structure delivered in the form of explicitly written procedural scripts can improve the results of AD CW groups. We performed an experiment with over 500 participants working in groups supported by advanced CW technologies that were designed for AD work. Participants were given six weeks to conduct their work. We found that high levels of process structure in novice AD CW groups that worked on a moderately complex task created significantly better outcomes than did groups using low levels of process structure. Groups with high levels of process structure had better results in terms of production, document quality, satisfaction, relationships, and communication. In no case did low-structure groups outperform high-structure groups. This research supports our hypothesis that increased process structure delivered in the form of a repeatable process script can decrease process losses and increase process gains in novice AD CW groups. We conclude that it is not sufficient to give novice AD writing groups CW technology and time to conduct their tasks; these groups also need appropriate procedural support, which can be provided effectively through written scripts. © 2005 IEEE.""Many companies have followed the suggestion of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct voluntary self-audits of their environmental practices. When company environmental assessment auditors present the results of these compliance audits to management, their proposals for environmental remediation compete with many legitimate alternative proposals for limited company resources. The research reported on here evaluated the impact of three factors on the persuasiveness of environmental remediation memos. Specifically, the present investigation hypothesized that meeting profitability goals, the relative certainty of the costs of solving the environmental violation, and higher fines if the violation is discovered by government regulators would add to the persuasiveness of an environmental memo. Lack of meeting profitability goals, significant uncertainty about the costs of solving the environmental violation, and lower fines would reduce an environmental remediation proposal's persuasiveness. Data analysis confirmed the hypotheses. © 2002, Sage Publications.

The qualitative nature of this earlier study, however, limited quantitative measurement of the design features and learned skills. The present study examined supervisor perceptions about the relative importance of organizational factors affecting transfer, measured relationships between learned skills and workplace design features, and prioritized the importance of the design features to support learned communication skills. Participants in this case study held nonacademic supervisory positions at a major land-grant university. The supervisors had attended a communication skills training workshop and had been applying their learned skills for about 6 months. The findings indicate that workplace design appears to play a vital role in facilitating as well as impeding communication skills transfer in face-to-face interaction with employees. As a case study, organizations should not infer that these findings apply to all work settings as it may depend on the relevancy to the particular work situation and circumstances.© 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Organizations are increasingly investing in virtual customer communities that reduce communication barriers between organizations and customers. However, little is known regarding how virtual customer communities might affect a firm's learning and innovation activities. Research question: What effects do virtual customer communities have on the relationship between absorptive capacity and organizational innovation? Literature review: Research has shown that virtual customer communities promote knowledge creation and knowledge sharing by facilitating communication within a virtual customer community. We investigate the extent to which interactivity in virtual customer communities influences the relationship between a firm's absorptive capacity (the ability to identify, assimilate, and apply external knowledge) and the extent to which a firm develops incremental and radical innovations. Methodology: We test this model with a quantitative survey-based research design that involves 102 firm-sponsored virtual customer communities. We use hierarchical regression techniques to test our hypotheses. Results: Absorptive capacity is positively related to incremental innovation and negatively related to radical innovation. Furthermore, virtual customer community interactivity moderates the relationship between absorptive capacity and incremental innovation. Conclusions: Virtual customer communities are transforming communication relationships between organizations and customers in ways that influence a firm's learning and innovation activities. One limitation of our study is the use of a single respondent for our survey. We recommend that future research examine how virtual customer communities affect organization-customer communication channels. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""The author, applying a business simulation technique, finds that attitudes of participants and performance results are directly related to the frequency of feedback on performance.

The findings suggest that niche journals such as the Journal of Business Communication are very important to these academics' professional advancement and are, in general, well regarded in the respondents' host departments. Such journals are essential to the scholarly conversation in specialty areas that are not well served by bigger, mainstream journals. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""Using phenomenological methods of heuristic inquiry, nine midcareer women collaborated as co-researchers to explore learning in professional developmental relationships. Six months' interview and journal data revealed that women's developmental relationships are created and sustained largely through talk. Furthermore, they experience not only instrumental, performance-based learning, but also what Mezirow (1991) calls ""transformative"" learning-learning that significantly revises beliefs, attitudes, and values and results in a changed worldview or perspective. These findings suggest that current definitions of managerial communication may be too narrowly construed, neglecting its potentially developmental function. This study has important implications for midcareer women, human resource developers, and communication scholars. © 2002 by the Association for Business Communication.""Typical business communication courses provide significantly more opportunities for students to hone their skills in writing compared with speaking.

In- basket items do not appear in a vacuum; they are part of office routine. Fur thermore, there is a method of determining priorities for the items that must be answered—a method based on deadlines, degrees of complexity and im portance, and even one's own working habits—while other items simply can be discarded, or noted and filed. Only when the background and method have been taught can we expect students to approach the actual exercise as a real- world in-basket instead of as discrete additional assignments. © 1989, Sage Publications.

As Rogers and Swales among others have demonstrated, similar techniques can be detected in corporate communication. In this article, the use of French and Dutch personal and possessive pronouns in the first person plural is examined in internal communication documents. The focus is on the link between text types and the use of inclusive, exclusive, or ambiguous we. First the research material is described; then a concise overview of the literary sources is given; finally the results of the research are discussed. It will be demonstrated that managers can exploit personal pronouns strategically and that the use of we is a parameter for identifying text function.""This study examines the processes by which workers in a particular Indian call center located in Kolkata expanded on, negotiated, and chose among an array of possible, especially new, identities and identifications and the ways that these choices affected changing social discourses. Our case study depicted a workplace that was simultaneously casual and urgent, temporal and spatially free and constrained, situated in both Indian and U.S. cultures, and oriented toward business and night-club ambiances. Within this particular workplace, call center employees (re)constructed and negotiated among an array of discourses that bracketed opportunities for particular identities and identifications. Through these negotiation processes, they (a) engaged in strategic identity(ies) invocations and (b) reframed work, career, and family discourses and practices. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""E-mail has significantly impacted the way we communicate in business, possibly going so far as to affect the social structure of organizations. One under-explored affect of e-mail is how it impacts communication in smaller organizations. Given the ability of regular ""face-to-face"" interaction, is e-mail necessary to boost communication? A report of employee attitudes in one small business did provide an opportunity to observe the impact of e-mail on communications and employee attitudes. As a result, it is suspected that interoffice e-mail may serve to link formal and informal communication channels, particularly in terms of including managers to the informal communications network.""Using a qualitative approach to data collection and analysis, this article discusses some of the findings from a larger study on collaboration and the role of gender. Here, we profile three student engineering teams as they participate in processes leading to the submission of a report for a team-based technical communication course. While some theorists suggest that gender can play a significant role in achieving a successful team dynamic, our study only partially supports that claim. A synopsis of two women from two predominantly male teams reveals glimpses of what the literature describes as traditional gender-linked behaviors by both men and women, but the all-female team does not conform to stereotypical patterns and their behaviors call into question the existence of these interactional styles. We suggest that factors other than gender and independent of a team's gender composition - such as team commitment and a strong work ethic-exert a greater impact on collaboration. Nevertheless, the study does caution against assigning women to predominantly male teams since, when a team's social structure is mostly male, traditional gender-linked interactional behaviors as well as manifestations of the culture of engineering are more likely to emerge. Overall, the study underlines the importance of examining specific face-to-face interactions to see how behavior is situationally produced in order to more fully understand the interactional strategies open to individuals.""Language and communication, especially high- versus low-context communication styles, have been shown to lead to differences in Web sites. Low-context communication provides the lowest common denominator for intercultural communication through the Internet by making messages linear, articulated, explicit, and therefore easier to understand in the absence of contextual clues. Based on theories of intercultural business communication and recent empirical studies, this article investigates how communication styles influence Web site design and content. It is hypothesized that, for the global audience, Web sites from low-context communication countries are easier to find, use colors and graphics more effectively, make navigation more user-friendly, contain more corporate and product information cues, and offer more contract- and relationship-related content than Web sites from high-context communication countries. This article also contributes to international business communication by investigating the choice of languages in business-to-business (B2B) Web sites. Empirical findings confirm the influence of high- versus low-context communication styles through systematic content analysis of 597 B2B Web sites in 57 countries. High-context communication style may be detrimental to the design of global Web sites, making them less readable, less effective in their use of colors and graphics, and less interactive for the globally dispersed users. © 2010 by the Association for Business Communication.""Due to a new press policy, the Dutch equivalent of the District Attorney's office actively spreads information about its suspicions of illegal behavior. Newspapers, which are still a dominant form of news in the Netherlands, publish these suspicions. This will probably harm the suspected person's or company's image. This study addresses three questions. First, how severe is the damage caused by negative publicity in a Dutch regional daily? Second, are Dutch newspaper readers sensitive to the tone of certainty with which the accusations are expressed? Third, how lasting are any of these effects? In a field experiment, 448 readers of regional dailies, differing widely in age and education level, read either an actually published newspaper article on a possible bribery scandal, a more objective rewrite of this article, or some neutral information on the company's activities. Results show that the corporate image was seriously damaged by negative publicity. The more categorical the accusations were, the more damage there was. More than two weeks after reading the article, damage to the image was still present. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study examines the influence that organizational metaphors have on report writers' framing of their writing tasks and the stylistic, organizational, and document design choices they make. The study, conducted at a medium-size organization, uses participant observation, semi-structured individual and group inter views, and protocol analysis to gather data from 23 staff professionals at three field sites. The data show that writers see themselves as communication ciphers or con duits and describe their communication activities in mechanistic terms. These metaphors, which complemented the organization's view of itself as a smoothly operating machine, help explain why writers were neither aware of nor concerned about their report readers and why they write difficult-to-read reports. These results indicate that root organizational metaphors significantly influence writers'perception of their communication role and the rhetorical choices they make. Altering these writers' composing habits would be a major intervention requiring a change in the organization's dominant or root metaphor. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Included were the responses from 168 full-time nonmanagement working adults of Mexican origin working in Mexican organizations. The current study was grounded by the theory of independent mindedness. The findings offered support for the value of cultural congruency between the societal culture (macro) and the organizational culture (micro). Additional findings indicated that power distance, avoidance messages, communication apprehension, and communication satisfaction, were all positively related to the job satisfaction and organizational commitment of Mexican employees. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study sought to extend prior research by examining the prevalence of relational maintenance behaviors between coworkers and the impact of such behaviors on the work-related attitudes of job satisfaction, organizational commitment, communication satisfaction, and work alienation.

Based on Ames's theoretical framework on motivation, we propose a model for knowledge contribution in problem-solving virtual communities (PSVCs). The model includes two second-order individual motivations, with four major mechanisms in PSVCs that are associated with these motivations. Results confirm that only egoistic motives affect members' knowledge contribution in PSVCs. Further, knowledge repository and social identity are found to be important mechanisms for promoting knowledge contribution through egoistic motives. This paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications and provides insights for future research. © 2011 IEEE.""The aim of this study was to map the influence of reading task and text format on reading results with an online text. To this purpose, an experiment performed by Gordon et al. (1988) was replicated and enhanced. In four conditions, subjects were given a reading task (summarize or answer specific questions) and an online text (linear or hypertext format). In all conditions, both text and task were administered through the World Wide Web. After the subjects had completed their reading, all were given the same assignment: make a summary and answer specific questions. No significant main effects of the independent variables (format and task) were found on the performance of the subjects. There proved to be a significant interaction effect, however, on the completeness of the summaries. The most thorough summaries were written by subjects who were told before the experiment that they would have to summarize the text, and who were presented with the text in a linear version. As far as reading time was concerned, there was a significant difference between the format conditions: reading the text in linear format took more time than reading the text in hypertext format.""This study attempts to show how the purpose of three types of business and technical documents (instructions, annual reports, and sales promotional letters) affects the syntactical and rhetorical choices authors make in writing these documents. While the results of the examination rendered some predictable results, there were some surprises in the absence of many rhetorical schemes in sales promotional letters. Another value of this study is that it provides partial syntactical and rhetorical ""fingerprints"" of three important documents in business and technical writing to offer students norms they can go by in constructing such documents. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This research looked at the mechanisms newly-assigned managers used for handling personnel problems. The study compared the perceptions and information behaviors of new managers who were coping with personnel problems versus those dealing with other types of workplace problems. Subjects handling personnel problems were more uncertain about the situation, and used the rich media channels of supervisors and peers significantly more often than did subjects dealing with non-personnel problems. Demographic characteristics that affected the choice of information sources included whether the new manager had been appointed from inside or outside, sex, age, hierar chical level, and the type of business. Input from the subjects stressed the need for more effective information linkages, especially for managers appointed from outside of the organization; frequent communication with superiors, improved liaison with peers, and the development of subordinates as information providers. © 1991, Sage Publications.

Such an analysis may be of interest to textbook writers and educators.""Drawing upon eleven volumes of articles published between 1890 and 1990 in The Auk, journal of American ornithology, this study shows the path to professionalization through four phases of ornithological discourse history. In the science of ornithology, the interests of conservationists, science students, and scientists themselves were originally served by a single discourse form - the personal narrative of natural history. But, with professionalization, scientists increasingly associated such narratives with amateur performance. The resulting gap between professional science and public understanding of science was reinforced by the establishment of a university program of study in ornithology, by an emerging sense of a scientific community, and by the forces of environmentalism.""As the demand and opportunity for international business ventures increase, the need for interpreters also will increase. When an executive communicates through an interpreter, however, he or she must realize that the interpreter is not a passive conduit of information and may in fact have strategic impact on the conduct and scope of the cross-cultural encounter. This paper explicates this thesis by presenting descriptive models of the interpreter's role, six implications executives should consider before hiring an interpreter, and questions for future research. © 1993, Sage Publications.

We begin with background on the two disciplines involved in this particular project. Next, we explain why this project came to be and how it has progressed. We conclude with a framework for understanding our interdisciplinary exchange—what its outcomes are and how they are relevant to academic programs and the field in general.""This study examines the relationship among demographic factors, interview communication patterns, and interview outcomes. Specifically, we treated the interview as an interactive communication event by pairing and coding interviewer and applicant statements made in employment interviews to examine whether or not gender or race affected interview communication patterns and outcomes. Our findings indicate that gender and race factors had no direct impact on interview outcomes (i.e., ratings and referrals) nor did these factors indirectly affect outcomes through communication patterns. © 1995, Sage Publications.

These new channels require communicators to rethink the sources of information available for their messages, the ways they create messages, and the networks through which they distribute their messages. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service went through these steps when it created a unit to distribute information on public opinion to its managers in more than 900 field offices nationwide. © 1993 IEEE""The ISTE approach offers a new method of concurrent testing that is less time-consuming than usual. In addition, it helps catch the user in the act and the scores show almost immediately whether the user has processed the manual as intended. In the ISTE approach, the main Information (Sub)Types in a manual are coupled to their intended and unintended Effects on users. Research has shown that the ISTE approach yields reliable and valid findings. In addition, it has been found to be versatile and easy to apply, and it provides valuable insights on the usability of a manual.""We tend to regard listening as a passive, automatic process that just happens rather than as a skill that is essential for good communication. Yet in reality effective lis tening is a skill that needs to be developed as a prerequisite for successful practice of the more 'active' skills of speaking and writing. The insurance industry is a prime example of an industry that relies heavily on good listening skills for effective marketing. We conducted a study in Singapore of how listening is perceived by people involved in insurance. We found that more experienced people were well aware of its key role although students majoring in insurance believed speaking was more important. This study confirms earlier research: in the insurance indus try in Singapore there is a gap between the perceived need for good listening and the degree to which good listening skills are perceived to be possessed by insurance agents. © 2000, Sage Publications.

The technology transferred is a computer program named KIVA that simulates air flow, fuel sprays, and combustion in practical combustion devices such as automobile and truck engines, gas turbines that power jet aircraft, and industrial furnaces, heaters, and waste incinerators. The success of the transfer process derives not from presenting a finished product, but rather from working closely with KIVA users at every stage of development. By making the original source code available to a broad user community, a second avenue of transfer occurs as university engineering departments prepare students to enter industry. © 1993 IEEE""This article analyses the discursive and rhetorical strategies that help promote an image of competence in the corporate histories provided by the webpages of the top 25 companies ranked in the 2008 Fortune Most Admired 500. The analysis sheds light on the lexicogrammatical features deployed within a temporally structured framework. Furthermore, the linguistic approach is integrated with the modalities of visual semiotics. Specifically, referring to Lemke's ""trifunctional"" theoretical framework, this article discusses the mapping of organizational meanings as competence-oriented thematic pathways developed cross-modally. Against this background, it is argued that the identification of the construals of time can be particularly useful for the retrieval of meanings underlying the representation of competence as a process. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Nowadays there is a huge volume of financial information available on the web. There is also considerable debate about the impact, if any, that this information has on share prices and overall market sentiment. Fundamental and technical analysts believe that there is some value in financial information and that it can be exploited for predictive purposes. This article provides a commentary on various studies that involved the analysis of financial content for various goals using various methods. This article includes a discussion of their main findings and recurrent themes and concludes with some possible future directions for research. © 2015, The Author(s).""This article analyzes the recognition, development, and use of the power of persuasion in American sales letter from 1905-1920, as well as two other business-writing traditions which developed during this period: the “you” viewpoint and the five C's. Examples will show how these two traditions changed the language used in business letters, allowing these letters to play a dual role by making these letters easier for the consumer to read and understand and by using these letters to pursue the growth in national character of American business. The article concludes with a call for further research, to help prepare writers to produce the letters of the future. © 1991, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

We advocate teaching a unified system of visual rhetoric that encompasses both text and graphics within a common visual-language system. Using C. S. Peirce's three-part theory of rhetoric and his ten categories of sign, we offer an integrated semiotic system, interpreting in one model the effectiveness of graphics, document design, and formatting, all considered as subtypes in this proposed visual rhetoric, organized around three primary communication goals: to decorate, to indicate, and to inform. Thus, any evaluation of visuals, either textual or graphic, must be made with reference to rhetorical contexts in which audience needs and graphic/textual media choices should align with authorial goals. © 2007 IEEE.""Modern culture, with its rapidly increasing reliance on information exchange, requires that we develop a better understanding of the communication process. Because communication is such a complex process, previous communication models have generally oversimplified the process and failed to provide a usable, systematic overview of it. The Targowski/Bowman model introduces a new paradigm that isolates the various components for individual measurement and analysis, places the components into a unified whole, and places communica tion and its business component into a larger cultural context. © 1988, Sage Publications.

In this examination of the learning history, an emerging genre of organizational research writing, genre theory is used to examine the ways in which the learning history serves the rhetorical aims of the writer. Understanding the social image, rhetorical dynamics, and formal features of this genre will help organizational writers and researchers use learning histories within a qualitative research methodology. Furthermore, this research serves to demonstrate that genre analysis itself can be a rigorous research methodology. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Establishing the legitimacy of a profession is not a new idea. Many others have attempted to do so within their own field, most notably Kenneth Boulding. As an economist and a philosopher, Boulding published over 400 papers during his career. About 10 of these were concerned with the concept of legitimacy. The authors will use the model developed by Boulding and used by him to establish the legitimacy of economics to advance the legitimacy of the profession of business communication. Examples meeting the criteria identified in the model will be discussed to support this legitimacy. The future of the profession must include an awareness of characteristics that assist in the legitimization of a profession. Internal and external acceptance of professional legitimacy is necessary for continued success. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Many companies have entered a new era of human resources management - one based on transaction cost economics and one in which downsizing has become a permanent part of the corporate landscape. But their insistence on communicating decisions to downsize solely in economic terms is creating serious problems among employees who survive the layoffs. Disloyalty, disaffection, increased absenteeism, and even acts of sabotage are growing among workers who view downsizing as a social, not economic, issue. This article discusses the new era of human resources management and reviews survivor literature in an effort to provide guidance to companies about how to communicate downsizing, specifically, and how to communicate with the postdownsized workforce, generally.""Both in methodology and in findings, the investigations of the Challenger disaster, one by a Presidential Commission and one by a Congressional committee, demonstrate that even in highly technical matters, meaning is socially constructed. Drawing on the many recent critiques of the supposed impersonality of technical communication, the author examines the evidence and testimony before the investigating bodies and finds that before the launch, NASA officials construed information about O-ring charring in socially contingent ways and ultimately pressed engineers to work under similar assumptions in declaring the shuttle flightworthy. Further, although the two investigations examined much the same evidence, differing methodological assumptions led them to different conclusions and recommendations. Dombrowski finds that both investigations emphasized procedural concerns while largely neglecting personal judgment and responsibility, even though the evidence suggests a key role for personal and social judgment. He concludes that the field of professional communication needs to become more alert to the role of social factors in technical matters. © 1991 IEEE""There is a lot at stake when one submits an article for publication in a journal. The writer risks losing face by having the article rejected, but the writer's employment may also depend on publication. The writer is in a relatively powerless position; the editor who receives the article is in a more powerful position, making a judgement beyond which there is no appeal. The article is accompanied by a letterof submission in a stressful situation that might be expected to call for what V.K. Bhatia (1993) describes as a ""promotional letter"". These are letters written by people who hope to get some benefit from the recipient which the recipient is under no obligation to grant, e.g., unsolicited sales letters in business and letters of application. Bhatia characterizes promotional letters as having seven moves, which are listed. In contrast, actual letters of submission are rather short and cool and do not conform to Bhatia's model. The failure of submission letters to match the general ""promotional"" form that seems to be applicable to the power relations involved raises several questions. Is Bhatia's hypothesis that power relations and the purpose of the letter determine the content simply wrong, or is its operation suspended here by some subcultural convention? And if so, why? We carried out an investigation designed to resolve some of these questions and collected submission letters of four different types.""The current study examined the influence of supervisor communicator competence and leadership style on employee job and communication satisfaction. Participants were 220 individuals (116 men and 104 women) working full-time for a variety of companies in the Midwest. The findings indicated a strong relationship between supervisors' communicator competence and their task and relational leadership styles, with supervisor communicator competence being a stronger predictor of employee job and communication satisfaction. More specifically, the findings indicated that supervisor communicator competence accounted for 68% of the variance in subordinate communication satisfaction and nearly 18% of the variance in subordinate job satisfaction. More important, these findings provide an association between communication, leadership, and employee job and communication satisfaction. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Should business writing be strictly fuctual, devoid of lit erary niceties?

Drawing on genre theory and cultural studies, the paper further explores the relationship between linear texts and nonlinear hypertext genre. The paper shows how the websites aimed at the English-speaking readers are different from the sites targeted to the Finnish readers. It further illustrates the company strategies employed to establish the website in Finnish and English. These are endorsed by a company representative who was interviewed for the paper. The Finnish website meant for local Finnish readers contained detailed and itemized information and portrayed a retail-oriented strategy. The Internet presence targeted toward English-speaking readers portrayed an investor-oriented strategy. The characteristics of hypertext that distinguish it from linear texts are high rate of repetition and low macrolevel cohesion."Explains the rhetorical implications of actions and states in various models of procedural discourse and in specific writer strategies  Considers more flexible alternatives to the streamlined-step model."The popularity of technical writing and communication has caused many colleges and universities to scramble to hire qualified tenure-track faculty members. So-called lone ranger candidates are often lured to workplaces in which they are the sole technical writing faculty members by promises of autonomy and the ability to develop programs in ways, and at a pace, that would not necessarily be possible at other institutions. This article explores challenges faced by several such lone ranger faculty members and outlines survival strategies that may help lone rangers sustain and build their technical writing programs. © 2006 Sage Publications.""Joan Saliskas has a Ph.D. in English from the University of Illinois.

First, features gleaned from 13 model letters in technical writing textbooks yield figures on the number of words, sentences, and paragraphs per letter, plus the average number of words per sentence and paragraph, information helpful to those with little or no knowledge of how to write a strong cover letter. Second, the article surveys what the textbook writers offer as advice about the rhetorical principles that should be employed in composing cover letters. One piece of advice given by almost all of the experts is that writers should try to exude an energetic attitude, yet these same authorities do not delineate just how to display such a posture in the letters themselves. Third, examination of the letters reveals that one way that experts insert verve into cover letters is to use verbals, particularly gerunds, participles, and infinitives. In fact, 92.58% of the sentences in the 13 model letters have some type of verbal in them. The advantage of employing verbals is that while they are used for other parts of speech, they still retain the residue of action in their meaning. Fourth, the article describes the results of a survey to determine the acceptance of such constructions in the minds of two sets of readers: first-year writing students and third-year technical writing students. In both groups, more than 75% of the students preferred a paragraph with verbals in it over a paragraph devoid of verbals. Finally, the article suggests ""sentence combining"" as a procedure for teaching technical writing students how to combine basic sentences into verbals to garner variety and economy, one of the hallmarks of technical writing.""The instructional project described in this article explores a model for reconceptualizing a form of short video instruction manual termed here as the ""Web app video."" The goal is to determine whether explicit instruction in minimalism can help students (and practitioners) apply such principles and heuristics to the genre of Web app videos and aid in invention within emergent documentation scenarios. Method: An instructional method was used in this study, specifically the introduction of minimalist documentation concepts and heuristics to instructional video production. This study compares assessment rubrics completed by students as pre- and post-test assessment data, though the success of the instructional method is not dependent upon these results. Results: After working with minimalism heuristics, student-produced videos showed greater attention to imperative mood language, task-orientation, and error representation than existing videos for Web applications. Though student-produced videos lacked production polish, they showed evidence of minimalist strategies. Conclusions: Minimalist documentation strategies can be successfully taught and applied to short videos designed to entertain, encourage, inform, and instruct potential users while enabling them to engage the Web application with more knowledge.""To determine the metaphor that represents cloning, a contemporary scientific revolution, this study examines articles published in Nature, Nature Biotechnology, Science, and Time that describe the cloning of the sheep Dolly. A plethora of figurative language may be garnered from these articles, and this study describes a number of them: metaphor (dead, natural, and technical), simile, hyperbole, personification, irony, cliché, paronomasia, antithesis, metonymy, anthimera, oxymoron, the rhetorical question, and analogy. The significance and relationship to cloning are explicated. The article concludes that the figures do not support a central metaphor. Further research is suggested to determine if the lack of a metaphor is a fluke or a trend in the development of scientific research and what the difference may be between scientific and technical metaphor.""This article discusses a comprehensive study of the mission statements of Fortune 1000 higher-performing and lower-performing firms to assess the current state of the mission statement. After content analysis of these firms' mission statements, the components included for these two groups of firms were compared. The higher-performing firms included eight of the nine recommended components more often than did the lower-performing firms, and the differences were significant for three of those components. Also, using textual analysis methods, this study identified strategies employed by these firms to create a strong identity-or internal ethos-and image-or external ethos. The two groups used somewhat similar strategies for building corporate identities and images but differed in the values they emphasized and the goodwill recipients they targeted. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Can we say that corporations are ""morally accountable"" for their actions in the same sense as are human individuals? This essay describes three rhetorical strategies used by postmodern corporations to construct social realities and obscure individual causation and control. These rhetorical strategies are decentering, deindividuation, and distanciation. Decentering is a process whereby individuals lose their sense of personal accountability as they are submerged within the corporate voice, obscuring matters of authorship, attribution, and responsibility. Deindividuation describes the process of assimilation into a corporation's symbolic reality. Distanciation is defined as the methods used to create, maintain, and alter this symbolic reality of diffused responsibility within the postmodern corporation. After examining these rhetorical strategies, it is possible to show that the postmodern corporation mediates and controls the reality of individuals; therefore, it, and not its members, should be viewed as morally accountable. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Dorothy Winsor's induction as an ATTW Fellow in 2007 and the disciplinary moment of reflection invited by this issue provide the exigence for the story of how Winsor's scholarship, and ethnographic scholarship more broadly, has shaped the field.

But unlike others in academic, academic engineers have some writing problems which justify their receiving various kinds of writing support. The writing problems unique to academic engineers are that they often have little knowledge and experience in writing they must produce a variety of documents, some of which affect not only their professional standing but also the academic standings of their engineering colleges and some lack fluency and confidence in their writing because English is not their native language. The best solution for addressing the writing problems of academic engineers is to provide adequate writing training for engineering students. But given the already compacted curricula of engineering colleges, this solution is not realistic. This article presents some second-best solutions which can ease the writing problems of academic engineers. © 1993 IEEE""This article examines the ""hybrid"" discourses of neo-capitalism at play in the emerging economy context of India through the case study of a prominent Indian company, which launched an ambitious organizational project in 2006-2008: the cheapest car in the world.

Findings address how the organization was crafted as a social actor, the organization-State relationship, and the organization's engagement with opposing interests.

The net work (spelled intentionally as two words) function of genre proposes a solution to the inherent incommensurability in applying the notion of genre as social action within the posthumanist and postsocial perspective of actor-network theory. The study proposes an approach to genre analysis informed by the net work genre function and demonstrates its affordances by analyzing two conventional workplace genres. Performing genre analysis from a net work perspective has value for assimilating writers, both students and workplace professionals, into a new professional domain or organization. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""While experts agree the U.S. recession is over, many employees feel that they are still being asked to do more work for less pay. This concept of less compensation for employees is not surprising, but no one has addressed how volunteers in organizations might also be affected by the economy.

Every one of them applies to Richard Hickock as he is revealed by Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, a nonfiction novel about the murder of Kansas farmer Herbert W. Clutter and his family forty years ago. It transcends the boundaries of traditional journalism by closely examining the entire constellation of antisocial personality traits that Hickock exhibits. Drawn in large part from jailhouse interviews, Capote's portrait of Hickock breathes life into the psychiatric literature, thus rendering intelligible the mental evaluation provided by the physician who examined the accused in preparation for his upcoming trial. In so doing, Capote's best-selling masterpiece serves as a case study of a psychopath, one that conforms to established medical authority while maintaining its popular appeal. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Most theories for auditing communications systems are too broad or too narrow.

Despite this prolific attention to communication organisation in the literature, having resulted in a number of normative prescriptions and suggestions, there has been little if any actual empirical research on aspects of communication organisation across companies. Moreover, within the little prior empirical research, scant attention has been given, firstly, to conceptual development in the sense of defining constructs and developing valid measures of communication organisation, and, secondly, to the contextual factors that may make a particular organisational arrangement of communication disciplines either more or less appropriate for a particular company. This paper therefore develops and tests a number of literature-derived propositions relating organisational dimensions to conditions in a company's internal and external environments. Findings of an exploratory empirical study show that the organisational relationship (in the form of different types of interaction and their degree of formalisation) between the two primary departments involved in a company's external communication programmes are correlated with such internal environmental conditions as the departments' domain similarity and resource dependence, as well as the prevailing organisational norms and cultural conditions within a company. © 2001 by the Association for Business Communication.""When document designers localize documents for readers in another country, they often assume that the organization of the material used with its original audience will be effective for readers in another country. Whether this assumption is sound depends on what organizational structure readers in other countries are accustomed to seeing. This study examines the organizational structure of 17 Japanese expository texts with the goal of determining what expository structure Japanese readers are most accustomed to reading. The results lead to implications for document designers and readers in both Japan and native English speaking countries.""This article claims that two social values in science - falsifiability of science and cooperation among scientists - determine use of passives in scientific communication. Scientists do not always develop valid theories, so scientific experiments must be amenable to being repeated and found invalid. This requires that the experiments must not be discrete events. Science is also a cooperative enterprise. As an integral part of science, scientific writing employs more passives than actives to focus on materials, methods, figures, processes, tables, concepts, etc. Use of passives to focus on the physical world helps de-emphasize discreteness of scientific experiments. Besides, it also helps remove personal qualifications of observing experimental results. Finally, it enhances cooperation among working scientists by providing a common knowledge base of scientific work - thing and objects. Looked at in this way, the passive voice in scientific writing represents professional practices of science instead of personal stylistic choices of individual scientists.""Usability has been widely implemented in technical communication curricula and workplace practices, but little attention has focused specifically on how usability and its pedagogy are addressed in our literature.

Graduate organizational communication faculty are aware that their classes serve as direct preparation for students entering business and professional careers. The knowledge learned and the skills acquired in these communication classes are abilities that students take with them to the career marketplace. As such, instructors look for ways to extend the boundaries of the classroom beyond the text and traditional instruction. Faculty believe that each method selected adds value to the educational experiences of students. However, do these methods and activities truly add value to the educational experience as the instructors hope they will? Furthermore, are specific programs more valuable than others?""Because of our increasingly litigious workplace, it is theoretically, educationally, and pragmatically imperative that business and technical communicators become familiar with and informed about the legal issues surrounding products liability. This article explains the products liability theories of negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability in relation to the publication of defective product information. It also examines the legal implications of printed media and written communications (such as safety, instructional, and promotional information) as integral parts of marketed products. Finally, it cautions all professional communicators concerning their personal legal responsibility for the accuracy and effectiveness of product documentation from the perspective of the ordinary, uninformed consumer, and it offers several guidelines for writing and organizing to avoid products liability lawsuits."Examines how design elements on an e-commerce Web site carry out the rhetorical function of persuasion Concludes that understanding how design elements appeal to a shopper gives designers tools they can apply in their work"This paper looks at three hypotheses: that regardless of the financially good or bad years of a corporation, the communication in the annual let ters to the stockholders will be predominantly positive; that negative words are less frequent in a financially good year than a bad year; and that German readers also tend to accept the same preferred, positive words as Americans. All hypotheses were sustained after viewing 12 annual letters to stockholders in 1975 and 12 letters in 1977.

Using a simultaneous or an alternating screen presentation, subjects had to perform short writing tasks, half of which required the use of one on-line document, the other half required two documents. The subjects' task performance as well as their appreciation of the task and the presentation mode were measured. The results show that performance and appreciation data do not run parallel. While all subjects clearly prefer a simultaneous mode of presenting information on the screen, performance data are much more varied and less clear cut: when reading, subjects performed significantly better in the alternating mode; when producing a text, subjects slightly benefited from simultaneous screens.""This study examines the content of president's letters of high and low performing firms in an effort to discover patterns in communication strategy. Preliminary analysis of president's letters of the top and bottom 25 firms of the Fortune 500 based on return on equity revealed six recurring themes: (a) Environment, (b) Growth, (c) Operating Philosophy, (d) Markets and Products, (e) Unfavorable Financial Reference, and (f) Favorable Financial Reference. Results indicate that high and low performing firms can be correctly classified based on themes emphasized in their respective presidents' letters. Low performing firms were correctly classified more frequently than high performing firms and both groups placed predominant emphasis on the past. These findings suggest that financial performance influences the manner in which CEOs report annual corporate results. © 1992, Sage Publications.

These results indicate that a more natural estimate of the age of a paper is not the number of years elapsed since its publication but the logarithm of this number. Hence, the temporal distance between two references is better estimated by the ratio of their ages rather than by their difference. The lognormal pdf is typical not only of the engineering literature, it can also be found in the human sciences. This pdf gives a time frame for gauging the period that is necessary to separate research with lasting value from research yielding more ephemeral results.

This analysis shows how the features of a successful persuasive ethos remain consistent through several genres, including scientific articles, reports, and press releases. Three major elements of a persuasive ethos include discussions of the practical implications of technical information, consistent efforts to make information accessible to the public, and a forthright representation of scientific uncertainties associated with complex technical information. By incorporating these elements into their texts, technical communicators can craft more persuasive documents dealing with controversial, high-stakes issues. © 2006 IEEE."The author describes the senior design project he developed as a partial fulfillment of the mechanical engineering technology degree and his experience with the senior design communication curriculum provided to assist students in writing the technical reports for their projects. He discusses the particular writing problems he encountered and how the writing course helped him overcome them. He illustrates his points with quotes from his report."Despite claims for at least the past quarter century of mature professional status for the field of technical communication, studies in the history and sociology of the professions provide criteria that suggest we are not yet truly a profession. This article reviews economic, sociopolitical, and ideological factors that characterize the modern professions and argues that the technical communication field, at best, only partially meets the criteria. The prospects for professional status of technical communication might be improved by developing a critical consciousness of the processes of professionalization and concertedly acting in ways that facilitate those processes. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Research in computer-mediated communication has usually emphasized the cognitive over the social aspects of communication, the medium over the message, and the product of communication over the process. In contrast, this paper emphasizes three constructs of the communication process: goal-based communication strategies, message form, and medium. We seek to balance cognitive and social communication strategies and to combine new and old measures of the message form (organization, formality, and size). A field study in an academic institution examines the content of text-based communication delivered by letter, memo, fax, and email. As expected, people prefer certain message and medium attributes for certain strategies. These findings are further investigated using open-ended interviews. We conclude with examples of practical implications on designing and implementing computer-mediated communication.""Support for the so-called “process movement” in composition theory, which purports to offer a radically new writing pedagogy, recently has begun to appear in the business communication literature. But before business communication instructors wholeheartedly embrace the tenets of the movement, they should be aware that the process approach to writing suffers from several methodological defects, appears to be based on a number of mistakes about the nature of language and mind, and may lead to contentless courses full of solipsistic students. Examined critically, process ideas seem to have only limited usefulness in business communication; the process movement itself is more an ideology than an endeavor based on dispassionate, rational scholarly inquiry. © 1987, Sage Publications.

An arguably older form of autobiography-the portfolio-has, unlike the literary biography, languished on the periphery of academia during our time. While it should not be controversial to say that possession of an heuristic bent is one mark of a successful education (since learning how to think, that is learning how to be open, alert, engaged, is the fundamental mission of the student), the portfolio has been ignored in part because of its modern connotation as a 'marketing' tool but perhaps more significantly because as a heuristic methodology it is a threat to the centrality of the pedagogue. I argue that the portfolio deserves at very least a re-evaluation throughout academic (to say nothing of quotidian) life as an indispensable tool of the spirit of pedagogy. Like the autobiography, it is validated by the belief that gathering data or details about individual lives has to precede drawing general conclusions or seeing any overarching patterns.""Editing includes teaching authors how to write, but the traditional editor's task, like the teacher's, is complicated by the additional requirement of being a gatekeeper of an author's work. When teachers (like editors) see their primary task as judges or gatekeepers, they can become engaged in adversarial relationships that contradict their role as enablers/teachers. The author's editor, on the other hand, is an emerging model of the editor-author relationship that focuses on helping authors meet the expectations of gatekeeping journal and book editors. Teachers can use the author's-editor model in the professional writing classroom to minimize the current-traditional emphasis on the product and emphasize the collaborative nature of the writing process. © 1992, (publisher).

The discipline of writing a short, carefully planned, programmed sequence teaches a writer precision in the use of words and can serve as a teaching tool in business writing. Effective program writing requires the writer to: know precisely the objectives of the writing the program; understand the exact behavior expected of students when they have completed the program; make accurate assumptions about the knowledge the students will bring with them when they begin the program. ""Ecological inquiry (EI) in research of academic and workplace writing explores interactions between individuals and environments as these entities interpenetrate.

This article analyzes some of the values that drive science, public policy, and national intelligence, and traces how those values affected the Assessment writers' goals and communication strategies. Through close reading of the Assessment's foreword and first section, this study shows how the writers shaped scientific and technical information to satisfy their disciplines' values and to naturalize their ""proper perspective"" on the policy case. Further analysis of similar documents will extend current research on scientific rhetoric, multidisciplinary collaborative writing, and public communication.""One of the most notable aspects of the new avproach to quality control is its emphasis on the customer.

Changing the relationship between designer and user, this new form of data design has intensified the affective impact of data displays by eliciting emotions ranging from excitement and empathy to anxiety and fear. Methods: This article draws on historical and contemporary sources to build its case. It gives an overview of emotional appeals in the rhetorical tradition, from Aristotle to modern theorists like George Campbell, who emphasized sensory responses through personalization and proximity. The article provides an historical overview of pathos appeals in data design during the later nineteenth century and the shift to modernist minimalism in the twentieth century. Contemporary examples from companies, nonprofits, government agencies, and individual designers illustrate how data visualization arouses emotion. Results: Emotional appeals during the nineteenth century focused primarily on color and design novelty, which, by appealing largely to the senses, fostered emotional responses such as excitement and curiosity. Contemporary data visualization makes similar emotional appeals through the use of color, novelty, and multimodal features; however, digital technology also allows designers to appeal to the emotions by personalizing displays through interactivity, spatial and temporal proximity, and aesthetic and expressive elements. Conclusion: Pathos (emotional) appeals have become an integral part of contemporary data visualization, largely because of the multimodal and interactive affordances of digital technology. Designers who understand this dimension of data design can deploy technology to make their displays more engaging, humane, and usable. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

The information needs of corporate users, especially those found in mobile and diverse professional services organizations, have expanded as the sheer amount of data available worldwide has multiplied. Many corporations are trying to restructure traditional, and typically stand-alone, information repositories and services into entities that will better serve today's, and tomorrow's, business information customer. As an example, the paper describes the approach being taken to establishing a new information model at the ""Big Six"" public accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. © 1996 IEEE.""This study examines the reading apprehension, the writing performance, and the perceived job reading requirements of 91 students enrolled in an upper-division business writing course at the University of Arizona. To measure reading apprehension, the investigators used the Estes Scale (1971), and a modification of the frequently used writing apprehension measure developed by Daly and Miller (1975). The investigators used course grades to measure writing performance, and they used a single question to measure students perceptions of reading requirements in their future jobs. Results indicated that students with higher course grades exhibited lower levels of reading apprehension. Further, those students also anticipated higher reatlitig requirements in their future jobs. Theoretical and pedagogical implications are discussed. © 1986, Sage Publications.

Four main findings emerge from this study: (a) People are primarily interested in recruitment information and product-related information on corporate websites but not in corporate social responsibility messages or financial information; (b) content features on corporate websites are retrieved more frequently out of work-related interest than out of private interest; (c) utilitarian motivations provide more compelling reasons for people to visit corporate websites than hedonic motivations do; and (d) Internet users from Asia visit corporate websites for hedonic purposes to a far greater extent than respondents from Europe do. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication."This study was designed to investigate new ways of reducing upward com munication distortion. The independent variables of channel of communi cation and anonymity were employed to determine their relative effects on satisfaction with upward communication and distortion of upward communication.

Cultural conventions inform language, often creating differences in the content, organizational pattern, presentation of argument, style, and format of business documents. Differences in conventions can lead to readers’ misinterpretation or failure to understand a message. International business communication is evolving along with the global economy in four distinct patterns: as a hybridized language, as a business interlanguage, as a multiconventional language, and as an international language. The present workforce and those about to enter it need to become sensitized to the effects of multicultural conventions on their business communication. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The samples included a per suasive request letter, Sage Publications. Twenty dimensions of style were evaluated: number of words, number of sentences, number of passive verbs, use of the direct/indirect plan, number of abbreviations, number of contractions, number of specific references, number of courtesy words, action demanded /requested, number of jargon and slang words, number of intensifiers, number of qualifiers and disclaimers, number of superlatives, number of negative words, number of extravagant adjectives, number of sports and military-related words, number of hostile verbs, tag questions, average sentence length, and percent of passive verbs. Analysis of Variance tests showed significant differences by letter but not by gender, with no significant interaction between letter and gender. Discriminate Analysis produced a signiftcant linear equation with eight style dimensions; however, the eight variables accounted for only 14.9 percent of the variance. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Communication researchers have explored and developed persuasive/framing models for practice to bridge the gap between leader intent and employee outcomes through verbal communication with the prospect of enhancing employee motivation. This article takes a unique approach to these questions by using a different communication model to clarify the nature and processes of the relationships between motivating language theory and its effects on employee self-efficacy and performance. Consequently, this study examines the role of motivating language theory leader language, with a primarily female group of 151 health care professionals, as an enhancement of employee self-efficacy. The methodology is a partial least squares model that explores the strength and direction of leader motivating language with self-efficacy and performance. All the relationships were supported as positive and significant. The partial least squares coefficients indicate that employee self-efficacy is 34% higher with increased levels of leader motivating language. The same data analysis reveals that employee performance grows by 20% with higher motivating language speech, and that employees with higher levels of self-efficacy will perform 10% better than in those cases when self-efficacy is lessened. Finally, future recommendations are presented to nourish these relationships through research-including greater generalizability, and for practice through training and development design. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper reports the results of a field study investigating the relationship between perceived message distortion and job satisfaction.

Since one of the goals of this behavior is to create a favorable impression in the audience, self-monitoring has been identified as a factor that might be related to an individual's being perceived as a leader. Although several studies have revealed a significant relationship between self-monitoring and leader emergence, relatively few have examined the relationship outside the laboratory setting. The purpose of the two studies reported in this article was to examine whether self-reported scores on a measure of self-monitoring would be related to leader emergence in student groups working on realistic, sustained projects. Study One revealed a low, but significant, correlation between self-monitoring and leader emergence. Study Two found a negligible relationship in the overall sample, but a significant moderate correlation in a group of preferred leaders who were examined separately. The variation in magnitude of correlations in the overall sample seemed to be explained by fluctuations in correlations for females. The relationship between self-monitoring and males remained at a low but stable level over the two studies. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""This study analyzed the relationship between writing style and leadership style of 117 supervisors. It also analyzed the effect that supervisory expe rience, formal education, and management training had on this relationship. Style was defined and measured in terms of structure and consideration. There was no significant positive relationship for the dimension of consid eration. However, there were significant negative relationships for the dimension of structure. Management training had a significant effect on writing style. © 1981, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.""The relationship of thirteen communication variables to work stress was analyzed. The relationship of Personal Behavioral Style (Type A) to these thirteen variables was also investigated. By means of regression analysis, it was found that group support had the greatest relationship to work stress. The results of a stepwise regression found that Role Conflict, Role Overload, Career Development, and Group Support resulted in a.951 R-Square. Two of the thirteen communication variables—Role Overload and Responsibility for People-were significantly related to Type A Behavioral Style. The conclusion is made that group and individual level communication variables are more closely related to work stress than are organizational communication variables. Consequently, activities such as team building and individual communication skills should receive attention before variables at the organizational level when attempting to reduce work stress. © 1987, Sage Publications.

The subjects also completed questionnaires measuring their per ceptions of six aspects of the communication climate within their respective organizations: supportiveness, openness and empathy, per ceived accuracy of downward communication, upward communication satisfaction, perceived information reliability, and the overall openness of communication. Results indicate partial support for the overall hypothesis that individuals who are intrinsically motivated would per ceive the communication climate as more open than would those who are extrinsically motivated. © 1978, Sage Publications.

A pre-postinterview research design conducted at a university placement center showed that interview communication satisfaction significantly predicted applicants'postinterview attraction to vacancies, whereas preinterview attraction to vacancies did not predict applicants' interview communication satisfaction. It was also found that applicants'employment intentions were significantly influenced by the extent to which they were satisfied with the communication during interviews.

Applications of critical theory help strengthen our discipline by forcing us to delineate extant approaches and consider whether democratic goals are being achieved through those approaches. If a critical theory of illustrations can be built from Feenberg's critical theory of technology, it should be useful for classroom instructors and researchers as well as theorists.""Usability testers have drawn on demonstrated practices from a variety of the social and clinical sciences in developing their methods. They have recognized the utility of these practices in illuminating critical aspects of the interaction of humans with computers and with texts. However, they appear to have imported many of the methods without importing the concerns for the reliability and validity of the data produced, concerns that are critical to the effectiveness of the methods. This paper suggests that the concepts of reliability and validity are relevant to usability testing. Furthermore, it suggests that a concern for reliability and validity will enhance the credibility and effectiveness of usability testers. © 1989 IEEE""The report for decision making shares some common ground with the proposal, the report of scientific experiment, and even the persuasive essay, yet these genres differ. Recognizing these differences is necessary for effective inquiry, pedagogy, and decision making. The genres are means of solving different types of problems: practical, empirical, and theoretical. They serve different aims: action, demonstration, and conviction. The proposal, like the report, may solve practical problems, but the proposal advocates, whereas the report inquires. These genres all embody assumptions about problem solving and inquiry in their forms. Applying the problem-solving goals and methods of the proposal, experimental report, or essay to the report for decision making compromises the quality of the inquiry and of the resulting decision. Complex problems for decision making require a rhetorical method of inquiry based on Aristotle's special topics. The report genre reflects the invention heuristics and analysis in its form. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The development of consortia requires cooperation between industry, government, and academia, each of which has different goals. The university is interested primarily in enhancing basic research and secondarily in obtaining patents, funds, and support. Industry is interested in the the direct use of basic ideas in industrial application, while the government is interested in the rapid growth of technology and encouragement of arrangements to stimulate it. Formation of consortia requires sound science, clear administration, and plentiful financing. Each entity in the group must obtain benefits or the effort will fail. Organization of a consortium must take into account the legal requirements of patenting, disclosure of information, trade secret handling, and relations between organizations which may wish to use the same information in different ways. Difficulties often arise in academic institutions which must reconcile teaching and other faculty responsibility and work in the consortium with promotion and pay. Industry must be prepared to wait for results and to contribute while waiting. Nevertheless, the consortium idea is spreading rapidly as all elements identify clear advantages. © 1991 IEEE""The traditional internship meets the needs of full-time students with little or no professional experience. The traditional internship model is less valuable for the many students who are enrolled part-time while working in communication-related and other professional positions. In this article, I argue that this population of students can benefit from the learning opportunities of an internship if the internship is appropriately adapted to their needs, and I describe an internship model that my colleagues and I have developed to serve these students. This model, the “research-experiential internship,” has the potential to benefit not only the growing number of nontraditional students at universities and colleges nationwide, but also the client organizations where these students work and the academic programs in which these students participate.""Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene illustrates the power of ambiguity in scientific discourse. The rhetorical and epistemic resources that ambiguity provide are most apparent at the level of metaphor but are also central to the exigency for Dawkins's argument and to the narrative form that the argument takes. Using ratios derived from Burke's dramatistic pentad, I analyze how ambiguous language helped Dawkins to link different theoretical conceptions of the gene and consequently posit connections between genes and organisms that had not yet been empirically established. I thus demonstrate at a conceptual and textual level how ambiguity contributes to the construction of novel scientific arguments. For Dawkins, ambiguity provided a discursive space in which he could speculate on connections and developments for which he did not yet have evidence, data, or terminology. Despite his insistence that his use of figurative motive language was simply a ""convenient shorthand"" for more technical language, The Selfish Gene demonstrates the powerful epistemological and rhetorical role that ambiguous metaphors play in biological discourse. © The Author(s) 2010.""Two versions of a biological opinion written by different teams in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service illuminate how different rhetorical strategies reflect different values.

The study had assured women that lumpectomy plus radiation was as safe as the more invasive mastectomy procedure for early-stage breast cancer; however, the revelation of fraud called these results into question. We examine the reactions of two professional medical journals to demonstrate how negotiations for upholding ethical norms in science took place within the pages of these publications. Then, we analyze the public discourse surrounding the fraud and show that much of the coverage was devoted to scandal. Both forums missed opportunities: professional journals ignored a chance to explore the blurry boundary between ""writing up"" and ""making up"" results that all scientists must negotiate in interpreting and publicizing data, while public discourse neglected women affected by the fraud.""This article explores the ramifications of deploying free and open source software (F/OSS) for technical communication program development.

The sales model underpinning traditional business communication principles does not consider the effect of such power in memos written by managers to subordinates. Three rhetorical and linguistic strategies that reflect the construct of power in managerial communication are projecting leadership, assuming commonality, and controlling information. These strategies, which have not been sufficiently considered in theoretical and applied research, suggest the need to consider new ways of articulating principles for management communication. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The IOM's text explores social and behavioral research to devise multipronged intervention strategies; it focuses on social, economic, behavioral, and political health as a means of assuring population health - and thereby expands the conventional boundaries of public health. Since Chaim Perelman's rhetoric is seldom applied in the field of health communication, employing his ideas to consider the role of style, arrangement, and argument in such a cutting-edge document can illuminate public health writing, as well as shed new light on Perelmanian rhetoric.""The authors argue that technical communication instructors are in a particularly apt position to teach social media as key to students lives as technical communicators and future professionals.

This article reveals that these reports (svodkas in Russian) strain to rhetorically construct a social classification of the peasantry by dividing it into the kulaks (wealthy peasants hostile to Soviet power), the bednyaks (poor peasants supporting Soviet power), and the serednyaks (peasants of average means with uncertain attitudes to the regime). The svodkas persuaded their audience - the secret police and the governments - of the reality of this tripartite classification. This persuasion derived from their massiveness, secretiveness, and mixture of ideological and technical language. Since these conditions inhere in modern governmental, technical, and scientific discourse, the writers for these fields should be aware that when they engage in constructing order through classification, they face temptations of what Kenneth Burke calls rhetoric of hierarchy with its scapegoat principle. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Socializing technology is the rhetorical goal of technology transfer.

Whereas some technology-oriented genre research has sought how a new medium provides genres with new technological features, this article argues that a more insightful approach would seek how a new medium, together with its users, provides genres with new rhetorical situations. To operationally define rhetorical situations, I adapt Lloyd Bitzer's three situational dimensions of exigence, audience, and constraints. Then, to illustrate how the new rhetorical situations of the Web can influence a genre, I explore the genre of the résumé. Drawing on a survey of 100 Web résumé authors and an analysis of their sites, I show that as each of the three dimensions of the résumé's traditional rhetorical situation has opened itself to greater diversity on the Web, the Web version of the résumé genre has correspondingly reoriented itself. Hence, genres change in response not just to the new medium's technology per se but to the new rhetorical situations that the medium hosts.""Estuary English is a combination of nonregional and local southeastern English pronunciation and intonation that lies between R.

The present research models the necessary prior conditions for conference success, conference process variables, conference outcomes, and long-term consequences of effective integration for an organization that ultimately determine the effectiveness of a conference as an integrating mechanism. In general, the most important elements of the model in this empirical test were those associated with planning. Individuals get out of conferences what they put into them; old-timers who were active in the planning of the conference had very positive reactions. Thus, one way of enhancing conferences for all participants would be involving more people in their planning and execution. Conferences are, however, exceedingly expensive and only in special circumstances will their use as integrating mechanisms be justified. There are also circumstances where too much integration becomes a bad thing for an organization and not all conferences will be effective integrating mechanisms. Generally, organizations which could successfully utilize a conference will be faced with one or another of the following circumstances: a high level of differentiation with many functional subunits, a high need to maintain an organizational culture, or a highly dynamic environment. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""In ""Professional Documentation,"" a class designed to make Hungarian students of English translation familiar with written genres, that are not translation, abstracting plays an important role. Students get theoretical background to abstracting in a lecture and by analyzing the appropriate chapters of technical writing textbooks. The structure and objectivity of the abstract, the features of its informative variant receive special attention. Practical student activities include analyzing and writing abstracts in different settings. Many of the methods applied can be used in the education of translators in other languages and in technical writing classes in other countries.""The role of literary and rhetorical tropes in scientific discourse is frequently overlooked, largely because ""rhetoric"" and ""science"" seem to be incompatible modes of expression. However, if we look closely at scientific explanations - especially those designed to inform a general public-we find that they are as reliant on, if not more so, than more ""subjective"" forms of public discourse. In A Grammar of Motive, Kenneth Burke posits that all forms of discourse rely heavily on the ""four master tropes"" of metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony to express ideas, and science is not an exception. This article outlines the processes behind the four master tropes and demonstrates instances where these tropes occur in the expression of scientific concepts found in such fields as biology, physics, and even mathematics. The purpose is to show that, contrary to what many members of the scientific (and lay) community suppose, rhetorical and literary tropes are necessary components to a linguistic understanding of complex scientific concepts; that such tropes do not hinder our understanding, but are in fact necessary to it. © 1998, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Computer technology has had a major impact on the business environment and, consequently, on business communication. While computers significantly increase productivity, ignoring human considerations in automating offices leads to employee resistance. As computer technology continues to change, it will undoubtedly have a major impact on patterns of communication within organizations. Because successful implementation of automation depends upon how well employees are prepared for the change, business communication practitioners and educators must develop programs which synthesize research, training, and evaluation to help businesses anticipate the effects these changes will have on communication patterns. In this way business communication practitioners can clarify the purposes, processes, and effects of computer automation for employees, and develop an educational curriculum which prepares employees and business students for the future business environment. © 1986, Sage Publications.

This paper models how people contextualize messages in the face of changing communication complexity. Research question: Can changes in communication complexity that occur during the communication process explain and predict contextualization? Literature review: Theories of human communication and studies of computer supported collaboration suggest that communication complexity reflects potentially problematic conditions resulting from 1) the difference in perspective and context held by the collaborators; 2) the incompatibility between the message representation and the way it is interpreted and used by the receiver; and 3) the intensity of information exchanged between communicators. We use this definition as a basis of for developing a measure of cognitive communication complexity. The literature further suggests that higher communication complexity induces higher contextualization. Methodology: First, we conducted a pilot study to develop and validate measures of communication complexity. Second, we conducted a laboratory experiment, in which 258 participants working in pairs collaborated on a sixteen-step assembly task. They used a tailored system that structured each message as core (the essence of the message) and context (additional information that explains the core and the sender's perspective). We used unbalanced panel data analysis to examine the repeated measures of contextualization and communication complexity associated with each step of the task. Results and discussion: We found that collaborators respond to changes in communication complexity at the expense of higher collaborative effort. We offer a cost-benefit framework in which, at the step level, people contextualize to reduce the communication complexity, and at the task level, they additionally consider the impact of contextualization on task performance. The main limitation of this study was the need to structure the communication between collaborators, to control and measure contextualization. Future research can adapt and extend our measure of communication complexity to less structured communication. © 2014 IEEE.""This conceptual paper discusses the role communication plays in creating and maintaining learning organizations. A continuum ranging from Rational Choice Theory to Social Exchange Theory is proposed for relationship interactions. These relation-based interactions are effective for organizations exposed to conditions of instability and complexity. Attention is given to the communication embedded in the preconditions necessary for developing learning organizations (trust, commitment, perceived organizational support), in the indicators needed for preparing for this state (organization-employee relationship, valuing the employee, employee empowerment, and employee ownership and acceptance of responsibility) and in what Senge refers to as the five disciplines of learning organizations (systems thinking, personal mastery, mental models, building a shared vision, and team learning). An organizational case study using communication and relationships to create and maintain a learning organization is presented. Implications and conclusions are discussed. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""Communication plays a distinct role in the ethical behavior of managers. This paper proposes a theoretical framework of ethics, power, and communication in the workplace. First, a model of conceptual ethics is developed to provide a backdrop for viewing ethical decisions. Second, ethics in the workplace is discussed by showing how managers are often caught in a dilemma between the pressures of the job and their own personal code of ethics. And last, communication is proposed as the means to foster more ethical behavior in organizations. Although communication safeguards such as a code of ethics can and should be established, it is the managers themselves through more receptive communication who establish the norms of ethical conduct. © 1990, Sage Publications.

A Confucian virtual workplace in Korea is studied regarding the role of cultural protocol in the use of email. The survey results show that use of email is significantly influenced by cultural protocol, such as showing respect for seniors, within a Confucian virtual workplace. When a worker is faced with media choices for communication in a workplace where showing respect is considered essential, media richness of the chosen media is found to be less important than the capability of providing features to convey cultural protocol. © 2000 IEEE.""This article is a case-based theoretical exercise designed to investigate the role that ethics, culture, and artistry play in scientific illustration.

Based on a qualitative inductive analysis of data from interviews and observations at FLOSS conferences, we identify a variety of settings in which developers meet face-to-face, and we point out the activities performed in these settings and the benefits obtained. Contrary to conventional wisdom about distributed teams, FLOSS developers generally do not meet face-to-face until the project is well under way. An additional benefit of face-to-face meetings is time away from a regular job and speed of interaction for certain kinds of tasks. © 2007 IEEE.""The author reviews the research on the effectiveness of graphics in instruction and then proposes a framework for developing a theory that accounts for the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of graphics.

These professionals constructed three types of statements: vision statements, direct change statements, and indirect change statements. Professionals with higher assertive-directing motivational values tended to first construct vision statements and secondly construct direct change statements, whereas professionals higher in analytic-autonomizing motivational values tended to first construct indirect change statements and secondly construct direct change statements. Overall, early-career professionals displayed strong group orientation in their rationale for change and low directness in communicating change. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""The purpose of the study was to explore the effects of national culture and medium type on first impression bias reduction in the context of job interview and performance appraisals. Research questions: (1) Does the evaluators' national culture affect first impression bias reduction? (2) Which medium type (text or multimedia) is more effective in reducing first impression bias? and (3) Does medium effect in reducing first impression bias vary with national culture? Literature review: The purpose of the literature review is to examine the current literature in the areas of national culture, medium type and first impression bias reduction, especially in a communication context. Researchers reviewed the discussions on first impression formation, and national culture theories, and the Media Richness Theory. For media, multimedia type was found to reduce first impression bias more than text medium type. For national culture, the literature review suggested that national culture dimensions (such as collectivism, assertiveness, and uncertainty avoidance) could possibly affect first impression bias reduction. Methodology: The researchers conducted a quantitative experiment with 407 students from a US university and a Chinese university, who majored in business-related disciplines. Researchers requested the treatment group participants to access performance bias cue. The participants then performed an initial appraisal of a manager based on Denison's leadership index. The participants then viewed the job interview of the manager, via different media, and performed the appraisal again. The performance appraisal data were collected via a website. The researchers used Analysis of Variance to analyze the data. Results and discussion: This study found that for our participants, national culture reduces first impression bias more than media. It identified that first impression bias reduction in US participants is significantly greater than that in Chinese participants, independent of media used. Regardless of national culture of media users, this study found that users using text medium were able to reduce first impression bias significantly more than users using multimedia. The implications of this study are that to reduce first impression bias in cross-cultural settings, managers and employees must adapt the channels and effort allocation for communication to national culture. Managers and researchers must understand that national culture is more important than media in reducing first impression bias. The limitations of the study were the use of student participants, and absence of national culture dimensions measurement. The study was conducted in only two national cultures. Future research could use employees as participants, measure national culture dimensions, and replicate the study in various national cultures. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""This study investigates the difference in perceptions within the family-owned businesses of messages received from family members and outsiders to assess the role that relational familiarity (the amount of prior experience two people share communicating with each other) plays in internal business communication in these settings. Previous research has shown that this relational familiarity–along with experience with the communicative medium, the message topic, and the business context—lead to channel expansion (the ability to reduce uncertainty from a message with limited communicative cues) for business communicators. But the impact of relational familiarity on communication competence and personal biases between family members—which could impact the ability of relational familiarity to achieve its intended goals—has yet to be fully explored. Research questions: 1) Does increased relational familiarity between communicators lead to increased perceptions of message effectiveness and appropriateness in lean media settings? 2) In family business settings where familial biases may be prevalent, is increased relational familiarity linked to perceptions of increased sender likeability and lowered message negativity? Literature review: Channel Expansion Theory, which proposes that communicators can overcome the limitations of a medium by using their personal experience, guides this study. Previous research found that with personal experience with the communicator sending the message, a message receiver can enhance the limited capacity of a medium to convey cues that aid in understanding the message. Four perceptual variables—message effectiveness, message appropriateness, message negativity, sender likeability—result in benefits accrued from channel expansion and relational familiarity, such as reduced uncertainty and equivocality about the message topic. Methodology: A quasiexperimental setting was designed to elicit messages from business co-workers using email. Message senders were instructed to describe the same business problem in order for the recipient to understand the problem and decide how to proceed. Eighty-three family business owners, managers, and employees received one message from a family member belonging to the same business and one message assigned at random from a nonfamily member working elsewhere (a stranger). The 83 message receivers were asked to complete instruments measuring their perceptions of the messages. Results and conclusions: Results suggested that the relational familiarity between communicators played a significant role in improving message effectiveness and message appropriateness. Sender likeability was also enhanced when family members correctly identified the source of the message. The findings suggest that family members can benefit from channel expansion, though not as many members as expected, and that complex problem and task descriptions were communicated using lean media (communication channels that inhibit sending messages infused with communicative cues) and are perceived as most effective when described by familiar others.""Presents a qualitative study of three workplaces and the role rhetorical invention plays in the use of visuals in technical communication  Shows how those involved - including writers, designers, managers, and engineers - make decisions and choices about what content to visually represent in a document  Provides insights into the context and factors that shape visual rhetorical invention and their implications for teaching and practice.""In this paper, we explore the emergence of subgroups in global virtual teams and consider the impact that subgroups have on the communication patterns and interactions of these teams. The study presented here takes the case of eight virtual teams that were formed between two universities in two different countries. Our findings reveal that subgroups exert different degrees of impact on the team as a whole. Where the impact was high, boundaries were created between team members in different subgroups while the development of team cohesiveness was restricted. Nevertheless, all teams were able to produce high quality outcomes, suggesting that the emergence of subgroups may not always have a negative influence on team performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice. © 2005 IEEE.""The Association for Business Communication (ABC) has been instrumental in the development of business communication as an academic discipline.

This study investigated the reader's perspective by examining how writing features influence recruiters' assessments of résumés. Eighteen recruiters rated 72 résumés describing fictitious mechanical-engineering stu dents. Four résumé features were systematically varied: relevance of previous work experience, elaboration ofindependent coursework, stylistic quality, and mechanical correctness. The major result suggests that technical work experi ence is important but not sufficient: If the résumés of technically well- qualified applicants contained grammatical errors, recruiters rated these résumés lower than résumés listing less experience but containing more accu rate writing. © 1989, Sage Publications.

This article traces connections between this framework for technical communication and the philosophies of Michel de Certeau [4] and Andrew Feenberg [5], suggesting that the primary connection is a turn toward ""rhetoric"" as a mediator between scientific and philosophical communication. The article concludes that the current paradigm for understanding technology can be best understood by exploring three conjoined, yet competing, mentalities between a scientific, philosophical, and rhetorical worldview. While this three-dimensional approach provides a strong foundation for technical communication pedagogy and scholarship, it should continue to be re-examined for potential anomalies as the field continues to develop an identity. © 2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Some research results suggest that declarative information in a software manual is of little value to a user. However, most research methods are aimed at measuring specific information effects. They hardly ever yield data about what users select and use if they have a choice. Also, the concepts of procedural and declarative have not been operationalized consistently. Finally, one type of user has been the main focus of investigation so fan the tutorial user. In an attempt to specifically investigate the selection and use of procedural and declarative information, a new approach is described. In an experiment based on this new approach, special attention was paid to the operationalization of the information types and three different user types were included. The results show that users use more declarative information than is often assumed.""This paper describes: How desktop publishing requires us to design documents How elements in documents communicate identity, unity, sequence, and hierarchy, similarities and differences, and conventional meaning through visual characteristics like surrounding white space, size of font or element, value, placement, and orientation How information processing, graphic characteristics, and reading styles interact during reading to produce a visual hierarchy of document elements How to use this information with desktop publishing to design efficient documents © 1989 IEEE""Document designers who present procedural instructions can choose several formats: prose, table, logical tree, or flow chart.

This improved social capital leads to tacit knowledge sharing. Method: The proposed theoretical model is grounded in previously published research on organizational social capital and communities of practice, relevant literature, and survey research. The authors examine aspects of their previous research in social media and communities to build a theoretical model. Results: The theoretical model shows the congruent outcomes that occur when using social media to establish communities of practice to address the problem of sharing tacit knowledge within an organization. Conclusions: Communities of practice can form an important bridge between social media technology and people within an organization. Technical communicators can layer communities of practice on the top of social media for an effective strategy to develop increased social capital to support innovation, communication, and body of knowledge efforts.""This study examines the impact of a new communication tool, the social media release (SMR), on bloggers.

This article uses the industry life cycle framework as a lens to examine the formation of academic e-journals. The article proposes five factors affecting the academic publishing dominant design selection process, and examines these factors against six longitudinal case studies. The study concludes that from technical/functional, economic and market perspectives, e-journals are superior to paper journals (p-journals). However, academic social norms and the managerial processes needed to establish and maintain e-journals are more influential on their formation than the capabilities provided by the new technology. In addition, the long-term sustainability and survivability of e-journals depend on the administrative and managerial processes established by its management team. This study demonstrates that although the web enables a large number of new entrants and a variety of business and technical models, e-journals are a competency-enhancing innovation that relies on the existing expertise of professional publishers and the journal's ability to support the social and cultural needs of academia. © 2008 IEEE.""Dynamic relationships and interactions exist between upward and downward distortions of communication and the organizational clmate.

Rather than dwell on the familiar differences between Americans and Russians, Cold War adversaries, a common ground exists and is growing. We share a mutual interest in the successful entry of Russian technical communicators in the global marketplace. We also share an understanding that technology is central to civilization as we know it, and that the masters of technology have a substantial influence on all activities that they touch; a belief that technology has had a major beneficial effect on the peoples of the world, but that with such power comes the potential for large, serious, and potentially devastating influences; the idea that the embrace of technology is a good cultural fit with cultures formed from revolutions, for technology in the later part of this century has come to be synonymous with rapid change, and cultures with revolutionary heritage welcome change; the notion that technological breakthroughs have profound influences on the nature of work, liberating the traditional intensive physical nature of labor to the emergence of a knowledge worker; and the belief that the global marketplace forces the need for clear and rapid communication across borders, as well as among cultures. If we can agree on these technical communications issues, then we have a firm foundation for building a gateway to communication in the global market.""The few researchers who have investigated the matter date the advent of current business communication principles such as the “Seven C's” and reader adaptation from about 1906-1916. This article emends that research; demonstrates that principles supposed to have been specifically developed for the field are also found in English composition textbooks, several of which antedate 1906; and suggests that J. Willis Westlake, who enunciated similar principles in 1876, has as much right to the title of “pioneer” writer on business communication principles as do, say, A. G. Belding, Sher win Cody, or George Burton Hotchkiss. The article continues by showing that such principles belong to a 2000-year-old tradition of epistolographic writings.

In its evolution we can see the shift from individual to group authorship, an increasing use of visual elements, and a physical change from a small, hand-held volume to a weighty desktop reference. In a textual analysis, we can see that it was essentially static, changing only by additions and deletions, as the industry evolved. The eventual closing of hundreds of plants and the migration of the industry to other countries can be seen in the change of publisher, the sudden absence of photography, and the international references. Originally, the steel bible came from the factory floor and the words of the plant managers, but by the 1990s, it was a highly-abstracted representation of knowledge. In the steel bible, we can see the history of the industry and the maturing of technical communication in the 20th century.""We examine PowerPoint from the point of view of Jean-luc Doumont's design guidelines: those for individual slides and those for whole presentations. By analyzing two presentations on the same topic, designed for two very different audiences, we show that it follows from these guidelines that in all cases, full comprehension requires clearly articulated overall organization that integrates the verbal and the visual into a single message. This means that the crucial unit of analysis is not the individual slide, but the extent to which the individual slide is integrated into the presentation as a whole. The principle by which this integration is achieved changes as the audience does: General audience presentations are best organized by means of narrative, while professional audience presentations are best organized by means of argument. In all cases, audience adaptation is the master variable, determining what counts as the optimal integration of the verbal and the visual into a single message. © 2009 IEEE.""Many technical style guides and handbooks recommend use of a “topical structure” for reporting original results from experimental research. This structure typically follows the sequence: heading, abstract, introduction, experimental details, results, discussion of results, conclusions, acknowledgments, and references. Slight variations in this basic structure are also employed in reporting the development of a novel device, material, method, or theory. This article presents an overview on how each element of the topical structure evolved to its present state. © 1989 IEEE""This article proposes a taxonomy of scientific titles: those staking claims; those setting problems; and those conveying themes. A close analysis of the deep structure of these titles suggests that their goal is the maximization of information content within a short compass, a compression that permits their easy retrieval in computerized searches. Placing these titles into the context provided by Gross, Harmon, and Reidy's Communicating Science suggests further that titles evolved to this point by adapting to changes in systems of information retrieval.""The business communications professor sensing his own obsolescence should make his college his laboratory and direct his expertise toward improving its information network.

This paper investigates what syntactic manifestations of such advice we find in effective request letters. Two late sixteenth century letters are selected for this investigation: one is a model request letter from Angel Day's English Secretary and the other, Richard Quiney's letter to William Shakespeare requesting a loan. A syntactic analysis of the letters reveals that the favor, which is their topic, is not the grammatical subject of any sentence in either letter. In both letters, the grammatical subjects of all the sentences alternate between I and you. Syntactically, the I (suitor) and the you (donor) or we (both parties) overshadow the it (request). These letters thus point to a tendency in persuasive discourse towards subordinating the request itself to the psychologically delicate interaction between the suitor and the donor. The syntax reinforces this need in persuasive business correspondence to build a mutually productive relationship."This article presents an examination of a communication model that was presented in a previous issue. The author attempts to adapt this model in order to increase its supplementary value and explanatory power as well as its ability to predict the communicative outcome of a message in a given situation. The author contends that this increased value will be important to the field of business communication. The author discusses the advantages of the new model and notes that it serves as a managerial tool for evaluating the effectiveness of their communications and for anticipating a specific communicative result."With the formation of the European Economic Area in 1992, the demand for good technical communicators has grown rapidly. To satisfy that demand under specifically European conditions, courses in technical communication must have high status, be flexible, use distance-learning techniques, and meet the needs of in-service communicators. Such courses should concentrate on four skill areas: composition, text-handling, elicitation (including foreign languages), and specialized technical areas. Courses must also make use of experienced practitioners and be validated by the appropriate professional institutions. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The article presented here examines how two technical communication students successfully construct journal articles based on research from analytical reports completed earlier in the term. The students analyze their target audience(s) and revise their reports into technical articles by 1) assessing their purposes in writing the article, 2) selecting the most appropriate journal and audience for the article, and 3) adjusting the article’s topical slant, organization, content, and style to fit both the target journal’s editorial needs and the interests of its audience(s). © 1990 IEEE""This article chronicles the STC Technical Communication Body of Knowledge process from 2007 to 2009 and provides key elements of a landmark project to develop a body of disciplinary knowledge. Method: The author, who is a member of the Body of Knowledge Task Force, documents the chronology of the project through firsthand accounts. A brief review of literature helps to place this initiative within the context of technical communication professionalization and identifies its uniqueness from previous efforts. Results: The project demonstrates a productive partnership between practitioners and academics. It promises to help technical communicators assess their own level of knowledge and skills, provide easily accessible information for those wanting to hire technical communicators or enter the profession, and define the profession as a specialized set of skills, abilities, and knowledge. Conclusion: This project laid the groundwork for a body of knowledge that has the potential to establish technical communication as a true profession."" In this paper, I present the results of three studies on editing tests used to screen prospective technical communicators and the error types common to these tests. Because few publically available, authentic examples exist, I first explore the general characteristics of 55 tests and 71 error types. Error types are correlated against 176 professionals’ perceptions of these error types.Method: The sample’s characteristics were first identified from the tests and the hiring managers. Three raters then independently classified the errors types using coding schemas from previous taxonomies of college-level writing. Finally, a 24-question survey was administered to capture professional communicators’ perceptions of error.Results: Editing tests were typically designed in narrative format and evaluated holistically, but variation in administration and format existed. The sample included 3,568 errors and 71 error types. Errors related to wrong words, spelling, and capitalization dominated, but 13 other errors were frequently found as well as dispersed within at least 50% of the sample. Conversely, professionals were bothered most by apostrophe errors, homonyms, and sentence fragments. No significant correlations were found among the frequencies and dispersions of the editing tests’ errors and the professionals’ perceptions of those errors.Conclusions: Editing tests share common characteristics, but organizational context substantially influences its format and contents. There were consistencies between the editing test error types and types identified in college-writing taxonomies; however, context again influences why errors are introduced as well as the types of errors that were identified. Finally, hiring managers and professionals share different perceptions of error. Understanding these differences can produce better assessment tools and better prepare test takers. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

This study explores, through the perspective of the experiential learning cycle model developed by David Kolb, internships in technical communication. Participants in technical communication internship experiences were asked to provide, from their different perspectives, information that described the experience. Program directors, industrial supervisors, and student interns provided different views of what they had experienced, illustrating that most had entirely different perspectives on their level of participation in creating, supervising, and evaluating this form of educational experience. Besides describing technical communication programs in the United States more comprehensively, the results of this study raise questions about how the respondents perceived their experience and how the “reality” of these perceptions often conflict. When these findings are explored within the epistemology conceptualized by Kolb's experiential learning theory, a framework is established for more systemic procedures and standards that will enhance the internship as a credible learning experience. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Both studies had the same five objectives: first, to solicit the opinions of aerospace engineers and scientists regarding the importance of technical communication to their professions; second, to determine the use and production of technical communication by aerospace engineers and scientists; third, to seek their views about the appropriate content of the undergraduate course in technical communication; fourth, to determine aerospace engineers’ and scientists’ use of libraries, technical information centers, and on-line databases; and fifth, to determine the use and importance of computer and information technology to them. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to Russian aerospace engineers and scientists at the Central Aero-Hydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) and to their U.S. counterparts at the NASA Ames Research Center and the NASA Langley Research Center. The completion rates for the Russian and U.S. surveys were 64 and 61%, respectively. Responses of the Russian and U.S. participants to selected questions are presented in this paper. © 1993 IEEE""This article reports data from questionnaires assessing the day-to-day experiences that members of the technical communication field have in carrying out their research. The data revealed that most members experience at least some frustration and numerous constraints that prevent them from doing the kinds and amounts of research that they want to do and that may affect the quality of their research. In short, technical communication scholars face an array of challenges. This article presents examples of these challenges and ideas that respondents had both for lessening the challenges scholars face and for better preparing graduate students. It suggests several practical initiatives for addressing these challenges along with realistic strategies for implementing those initiatives. © 2009 Sage Publications.""This article reexamines Henry’s 2006 proposal for training technical communicators as “discourse workers,” as a solution within a certain postmodern problematic, in which changing economic conditions in the late 1990s and early 2000s made workers vulnerable to exploitation, outsourcing, and layoffs. Henry used postmodern and critical theory to describe discourse as a medium of leverage for enabling workers to define new workplace agencies. Even though Henry’s discourse worker is an appealing concept buttressed by solid theory, it did not become a widely implemented model for pedagogy or workplace practice. To reexamine Henry’s concept, the authors exchange late 20th-century postmodern theory for the more recent articulation of “post-postmodern” theory proposed by Nealon and explore the implications of swapping out the postmodern puzzle piece for a post-postmodern puzzle piece in Henry’s formulation of the discourse worker. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""This article argues for the need for a social justice approach to technical communication research and pedagogy. Given previous calls by scholars in technical and professional communication (TPC) for an attention to diversity, inclusion, and equality, the author examines the place and purpose of social justice in TPC and provides useful approaches for promoting a more genuine and critical interrogation of how work in TPC impacts the human experience. © The Author(s) 2016.""In spite of a critical turn in technical communication research, discussions of software documentation continue to forward a singularly instrumental understanding of how these types of texts are composed and consumed. Using work on multiliteracies, I illustrate how analysis of the competing evangelisms of software that occur in programming culture unveils the ways in which documentation, like code, is ideologically encoded. Attention to the evangelisms of software facilitates critical literacy and, consequently, a richer rhetorical literacy. Such literacies are necessary for composing effective software documentation and identifying how the ideologies of software and its documentation intersect with the nationally-situated cultural values in which these technologies and texts are developed and used. To illustrate this complexity, I offer examples of the intersections between free and open source software evangelisms and the national-as-local contexts of the United States, Brazil, and China. © 2011 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Communication between the West and the Middle East has at times been tenuous, disjointed, and ineffective. Due to the ever-increasing global market, it has become essential that American technical communicators cross these geographic, cultural, and language barriers to bridge this historical communication gap. Business with Saudi Arabia particularly has prompted American technical communicators to delve into all cultural and language dynamics of an Arab audience. In essence, the technical communicator must comprehend the impact of Islamic doctrine on the Arab business person; identify the philosophical, religious, historical, and social dynamics of the English/Arab communication process; recognize the fundamental differences between the English language and the Arabic language; and, after assessing the Arab audience and language level, implement the most effective communication strategies for effective communication with a high-context society such as Saudi Arabia. © 1998, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc."Focuses on less formal approaches to implementing cross-functional teams in software development environments  Shows that technical communicators are ideal candidates for initiating cross-functional approaches in their organizations.Examines research to suggest how editors can balance clarity and politeness in interactions with native and nonnative speakers Asserts that results of linguistic research can increase the effectiveness of editor-writer communication"This tutorial introduces issues regarding dissemination of information and texts that can affect international intellectual property rights. Four areas of concern for technical communicators include: (1) US and international rules about the disclosure of ideas and inventions; (2) corporate policies about confidentiality; (3) the complexities of international enforcement of intellectual property; and (4) principles of keeping records, including laboratory notebooks, that show ownership (including ownership of business methods). The training approach stresses a multipart program that includes understanding the patenting process; understanding and supporting corporate policies; and participating in dialogue about situations involving dissemination of information. This training should prepare technical communicators to evaluate or to recognize when to seek help from counsel in evaluating whether information should be disseminated. © 2007 IEEE.""In the Bulletin for September 1982, Professor Kellner of Texas A&M University published an article called “A Question of Competency.” The article has created a good deal of interest, and it won for Professor Kellner an Award of Merit from The Society for Technical Communication.

Suggesting the need to integrate contemporary persuasion theory into the business communication literature, the author synthesizes a wide range of persuasion theories and relevant research using four theoretical approaches: learning theory, consistency theory, perceptual theory, and functional theory. Where appropriate, the author suggests practical implications of these theories to business communication. © 1986, Sage Publications.

In the past, discussions on the theory of intercultural business communication have mostly focused on intercultural communication using business as examples rather than including business as a distinct variable. The model presented here discusses the intercultural, business, and communication strategies that are part of intercultural business communication. It is argued that for intercultural business communication to take place, it is not sufficient for all three variables to be present. The three variables interact and create a synergy that reflects the dynamic character of intercultural business communication. In this process, intercultural business communication becomes a unique construct that is different from intercultural medical or intercultural religious communication. The article examines how past articles in the field fit into this model. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper argues that students of business communication should be given introduction to the creative, poetic nature of language while in school. The author states that limiting a student's access to the beauty of language ultimately limits the usefulness of their language skills, because it is harder for the student to understand language. The author gives examples of poems and how they use language, and then explains how students can learn to use specific imagery in their business communications. The author states that business students need to understand how a key image works to evoke emotions in order to become more effective communicators. ""This article introduces and explains some of the major subsystems of the signalling that indicates patterns of continuity in texts. Based on linguistic analysis of actual English use, the principles discussed demonstrate the various ways writers keep track of the main theme of the exposition and how they change to and from sublopics as necessary during the text. Basic, associated, and perspective continuity techniques are examined with the aid of short published examples of writing, and there is some mention of the other subsystems in the overall system of continuity signalling.

Method: Proposes that prevailing approaches to professionalization are rooted in theories of occupations, the exclusive right to perform a job. True occupations have such rights legally; aspiring occupations like ours are disciplines. Common components of an infrastructure for occupations include professional organizations, bodies of knowledge, education, professional activities, and certification. Results: Disciplines often establish these in anticipation of becoming an occupation, but some practicing professionals interpret and use them differently, resulting in a spectrum of approaches to professionalization. At one end of the spectrum is formal professionalism, which views professionalization as a stepping stone to full occupational status. It is rooted in a worldview that values expertise and sees the infrastructure of an occupation supporting the development of expertise and controlling access to the profession. In the center of the spectrum is quasiprofessionalization, in which individuals participate in the activities of the occupational infrastructure but without the expectation of exclusive rights to perform the work. Quasiprofessionalization is rooted in professional identity. At the other end of the spectrum is contraprofessionalization, which refers to initiatives that offer or promote professional services outside of parts of or the entire infrastructure, sometimes circumventing it completely. This world view is rooted in market theory and characterized by concepts like do-it-yourself (DIY), usergenerated, and subject matter expert (SME)-provided documentation. Conclusions: The differing views suggest tensions regarding support for specific efforts to professionalize technical communication, including formal branding of the profession, establishment of certification, and support for professional organizations.""An overview of the three laws of professional communication was presented. The laws were analyzed on the basis of a simple premise and illustrated with examples of oral, written, and graphical communication. The precedence and subordination of the three laws to a zeroth law was discussed.""This article considers why users of popular software packages choose to find answers to their task problems on user forums rather than in official documentation. The author concludes that traditional documentation is developed around an antiquated notion of ""task,"" which leads to restrictive ways of thinking about problems that users encounter and the solutions that might be appropriate. The author argues, instead, that tasks and problems arise from networked rhetorical situations and networked contexts for rhetorical action. The influence of networks requires a redefinition of rhetorical situation and context, from which we derive a networked picture of tasks and problems as emergent and uncertain phenomenon, best addressed in the uncertain and sometimes-chaotic setting of user forums. Forum threads are studied using discourse analytic techniques to determine what they can reveal about qualities making tasks and problems uncertain.? ©?2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""A comparison of the reports of two space shuttle accidents is presented. The Columbia space shuttle accident in 2003 and Challenger space shuttle accident in 1986 were tragic in the loss of brave human life. Both were also tragic in what was revealed in the aftermath about key decisions leading up to the loss of the shuttles and crews. These space shuttle accidents set back the timetable for the United State's space shuttle program, for the International Space Station and for human spaceflight generally.""This article addresses previous arguments that call for increased emphasis on research in technical communication programs. Focusing on the value of scholarly-based research at the undergraduate level, we present New Mexico Tech's thesis model as an example of helping students develop familiarity with research skills and methods. This two-semester sequence serves as a capstone experience for students' writing, designing, editing, and presentation skills. It also involves members of our corporate advisory board and provides an opportunity to teach students to understand and apply research methods to unique projects, skills we argue will benefit students no matter what environments they enter upon graduation.""This essay argues that user centeredness has become ubiquitous and is in danger of being rendered meaningless. To address this problem, a meditative essay theorizes user centeredness by examining a base term-use-as defined through the ancient concepts of techne and the four causes of making.

Usability tests, comprehension tests, and questionnaires were collected from participants, and 4 areas of usability were analyzed: effectiveness, retention, satisfaction, and preference. Findings show marginal differences between the 2 mediums, except in terms of user satisfaction and instruction length. This research helps technical communicators better understand the affordances, or potentials and limitations, of print and video instructions. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.""A discussion of the real-world environment of usability testing in the computer industry leads into a discussion of how the real world constrains the usability process, and how the usability specialist can cope with the constraints. Focus is on two major constraints that result from the need to get information to the interface designers early enough so that they can use it: the need to work with incomplete materials, and the short amount of time usually allotted for a usability test iteration. © 1989 IEEE""This study explored how sales managers and sales people construct and perform motivational communication. Sullivan's (1988) Motivational Language Theory (MLT) was used as a starting point. This theory is critiqued and reinterpreted within a framework emphasizing multiple communication goals and multiple levels of communication competence. Participants included 24 sales managers and sales representatives from University Directories, a major publishing company of campus telephone directories. A thematic analysis was conducted on interview notes and transcripts, from which three major and four minor themes emerged. The experiences of three sales teams are explored to contextualize the themes, to illustrate deficiencies in MLT, and to highlight the potential of the alternative theoretical framework for explaining motivational communication. Findings demonstrate that motivational communication acts often address multiple communication goals and are open to multiple interpretations. Motivational communication considered competent by employees typically addresses multiple goals (instrumental, identity, and relational) by strategies of integration or separation and fits employees' beliefs about what constitutes competent communication. Managers therefore must pay attention to the multiple implications and interpretations of their motivational attempts and must adapt their communication strategically to employees' beliefs and values. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""Implications for user interface design are discussed. When designing online menus designers face the decision of whether to use iconic or command-based menus. In addition, with the advent of multimedia computers, it is now relatively easy to implement sound in the user interface. Important goals for interface designers are to determine when it is beneficial to use iconic or command-based menus and how these traditional menu systems can be enhanced by the use of sound. To investigate this topic, 28 subjects were asked to maneuver through one of four different implementations of an interactive software package in order to execute a target command using either an iconic or command-based menu with or without the use of sound. The sounds descended in pitch as the depth of the menu increased and were used as an auditory cue to code the location of a particular menu item. The results indicate that icons were more easily remembered than commands but that commands were easier to locate under the highest level branch of the menu. There was also a trend toward faster performance times with the use of command-based menus in comparison to iconic-based menus designed with the same structure. However, there was no difference in performance between iconic or command-based menus when sound was included in the user interface. © 1991 IEEE""This study investigated technical communication practitioners' and students' use of online collaborative writing tools (OCWTs), as well as their opinions about these tools. This family of tools includes wikis, online word processors, learning management systems (LMSs), and other collaborative tools. The data gathered were used to illustrate these tools' value to practitioners, as well as provide educators with recommendations about which tools to teach students. Method: Surveys were deployed to technical communication practitioners and students; each group had its own survey. The surveys gathered quantitative and qualitative data. The qualitative data were analyzed through a coding system. Results: Roughly 85% of both groups used OCWTs; however, practitioners used them daily while students used them only weekly. Practitioners primarily used tools chosen by their companies, and their most-used tools were Microsoft SharePoint, Google Docs, and company intranet. Students were features driven, and their mostused tools were Google Docs, PBWorks (formerly PBWiki), and Blackboard. Both groups had positive opinions overall about OCWTs. Conclusion: Technical communication practitioners appear to be using these tools often in the workplace, and several OCWTs appear to have become standards. These tools seem to hold value for practitioners, who use them for a wide variety of collaborative tasks. Technical communication students and educators should be aware of the OCWTs and collaborative tasks found in industry so that students can learn them. These tools include wikis, online word processors, and SharePoint (or something similar, such as an LMS). Finally, some tasks that practitioners perform (single sourcing, project management, and so forth) appear unfamiliar to students- it would be beneficial if students learned to perform these tasks in the classroom.""Americans contribute $240 billion dollars to charities each year, raised in part by writing letters to potential donors. While it is debatable what the reasons are for donors to give so much money, most donors seem to be moved to contribute by pathos, particularly pity. The concept of pathos as a rhetorical appeal has become more complex over the years, growing from a simple strategy to a complicated set of parameters requiring careful delineation. Beginning with the Greeks, particularly Aristotle, pathos was defined with greater clarity (especially the concept of enargia), with Aristotle's formal definitions of the emotions, and with the use of an image upon which to direct the audience's pity. Cicero adds to the theory by calling for the use of pathos in the peroration and reinforcing Aristotle's emphasis on careful audience analysis. St. Augustine and those who follow, including Renaissance, 18thcentury rhetoricians, and 20th-century scholars like Kenneth Burke, argue that style can also be an effective persuasive strategy for a pathetic appeal. Accordingly, the charity letters examined illustrate not only Aristotle's and Cicero's tenets but also show that elements of style, particularly rhetorical figures and schemes, are common rhetorical strategies used in these charity letters. While at first the rhetoric of charity letters seems simple and straightforward, to raise billions of dollars every year charity letters use sophisticated appeals to pity that have a long and interesting history.""This study extends the theory of Recognition Primed Decision-Making by applying it to groups. An experiment was conducted in which teams made resource allocation decisions while physically dispersed and supported with a shared virtual work surface (What You See Is What I See - WYSIWIS). The task required teams to recognize patterns and collaborate to allocate their resources appropriately. The experiment explored the use of tools (item versus chunk level communication) designed to minimize the cognitive effort required to recognize and communicate patterns among team members. Dependent measures included pattern communication correctness, pattern communication time, resource allocation time, and outcome quality. All teams received significant financial rewards in direct proportion to their outcome quality. Teams supported with the pattern-communicating tools had significantly higher outcome quality and significantly less resource movements and allocation time than teams in the control condition. Further, the teams that used the chunk-communicating tool performed significantly better than the teams supported with an item-communicating tool. © 2005 IEEE."Examines past and present decks of playing cards that communicate technical and scientific information Discusses the conventions of this unusual genre of technical communication Poses questions for consideration."This article discusses a study which examines the use of post-purchase communication to reduce dissonance and improve direct marketing effectiveness. The study demonstrates the use and potentially positive effects of post-purchase communication on order refund requests and reorder rates in this particular research setting. Based upon the findings of previous research, it seems plausible that dissonance was effectively reduced through post-purchasecommunication. The study attempts to reduce the number of orders returned for a refund under the firm's 30 day no risk guarantee of satisfaction and improve customer patronage, measured by an increase in repeat orders.""This paper reports a survey on how users maintain context in an electronic mail (e-mail) dialogue and, in particular, the use of quoting as a response strategy. The target group belonged to a community of experienced users of computer-mediated communication systems: Readers of Usenet newsgroups. The results showed that quoting a message, l.e., including it in a comment or reply, was a widely used technique in e-mail dialogues, but that the majority of respondents used it selectively. Factors that affected the use of quoting were the category of receiver and the length and nature of the message. Contrary to expectations, the results showed that users perceived the use of quoting as contributing to the sense of conversation when communicating in e-mail. © 1994 IEEE""Numerous studies have compared groups using oral brainstorming with groups utilizing an electronic technique based upon individual poolwriting, but very few studies have investigated groups using other electronic meeting techniques. Some research, however, indicates that one alternative electronic meeting technique based upon gallery writing may be superior to individual poolwriting in many situations. In this paper, we report a case involving five groups of stakeholders who used the two different electronic meeting techniques to discuss ways of improving a local private school. Survey results from the groups support findings from earlier laboratory experiments. Participants in the case study preferred electronic gallery writing over electronic poolwriting because of the former's ability to show users all of the groups' comments at the same time. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""To gain a better sense of the metaphorical nature of the scientific research paper, the author reviewed 89 journal articles taken from the top 400 most-cited documents in the Science Citation Index database for the period 1945–1988. Metaphorical constructions were found in a variety of forms: conceptual models, experimental designs, technical analogies, standard technical names, conventional figurative expressions, and even original figurative language normally associated with more-literary writing. Examples are given for each mode of metaphor. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Employee morale was so diminished from six years of constant reorganization and downsizing that the newly appointed vice-president was skeptical that the department would be able to meet its new goals unless a highly participative process was used. The project therefore was designed to use an input-reaction process between employees and managers to create a shared vision, strategic plan, and measurement system. Past projects of this nature had involved management personnel only and often goals were not achieved because few employees felt motivated by the ""top-down"" directives. This process produced a motivating vision, a highly doable performance plan, and a well-accepted measurement system within the allotted project schedule.""Technical communication professionals have been considering the value of faculty internships in technical communication. Whether professional societies, or industry, will fund such internships on any large scale is still in question. I believe that faculty internships are a superb option for professional development and that the benefits to the profession of technical communication accruing from them justify their support. This article reviews the debate about this topic and then describes some benefits derived from a faculty internship I served in 1991.""The value of formal writing conventions has been diminished in mainstream composition scholarship; although research on occupational writing suggests that formal conventions are important, these findings are hard to generalize. This study, a content analysis of 12 professional style manuals, achieves generalizability by elucidating the institutional norms of disciplinary writing (a subset of occupational writing to which much scientific and technical writing belongs). Formal conventions prove to be highly valued. More important, the use of formal conventions often is justified on rhetorical grounds, suggesting that the dichotomy between formalist and rhetorical axiologies posited in composition scholarship is false. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Linguistics is often seen as a specialised branch of language for language experts. When technical authors communicate, they do need the tools of linguistics to handle the rhetorical grammar and patterns of technical prose. The linguistic features and semanics involved in technical writing also become relevant, as is visual and graphic representation. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This article examines the value added to the United States Lighthouse Service by the operator's manuals, which were issued to the lighthouse keepers by the Light-House Board in 1852. Subsequent reports of the board to Congress conclusively show that the manuals resulted in a significant savings in the operating costs of the service. In addition, annual reports of district superintendents show that the instructional information improved the appearance and reliability of the lights. Furthermore, the manuals helped to reduce significantly the number of marine disasters along America's shores in the years following the board's decision."The range of roles performed by technical communicators during the systems development process was identified and published from a 1997 survey of Australian technical communicators. Follow-up case study research investigated the development of 20 information systems. The research sought to quantify the technical communicator's contribution from the external viewpoint of developers and users. This paper describes the major findings from this research. The results support the 1997 survey findings that technical communicators do contribute positively to information systems development. The results quantitatively demonstrate that users are significantly more satisfied with computer systems where technical communicators are involved in the development process."Magazines such as Working Mother and Business Week regularly publish lists of woman-friendly companies. The compiler of one such list asks to see the company's newsletter as an indicator of how a company treats its people. An analysis of photographs for 2 two-year periods (January 1985 through December 1986 and January 1991 through December 1992) showed that women were not portrayed equitably in IBM's employee newsletter Think. Compared to their presence in IBM's labor force, women were significantly underrepresented in photographs, both in 1985-86 and 1991-92. Although women constituted approximately 29% of IBM's workforce, only 23% of the 820 subjects of the coded pictures were females. Moreover, although women were pictured more frequently in 1991-92 than in 1985-86, the mean proportion of women in Think photos did not increase significantly. Women's portrayal as leaders (17.4%) did not differ significantly from the proportion of IBM managerial positions (20.0%) held by women, and the proportion remained stable over time. However, a large percentage of small-group photographs portrayed no clear leader, male or female. This fact was attributed to IBM's tendency to downplay managers in the magazine sent to all employees. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""The visual rhetoric of data displays (e.g., charts, graphs, maps) has changed profoundly over the past 50 years as a result of research in display techniques, the application of traditional and emerging rhetorical approaches, and the democratizing effects of data design technology. Perhaps in no other visual realm than data design is the notion of clarity more critical or more contested. Indeed the ascendancy of rhetorical approaches was initiated by the perceptual/cognitive science of data design, which in seeking to identify optimal display techniques, fostered a concern for ethics and evoked the universality and minimalism of modernist aesthetics. The rhetoric of adaptation, which emphasizes the variability of audiences, purposes, and situational contexts, rendered clarity contingent and mutable-a moving target that requires constant attention. Social rhetoric considered data design as a collective construct, tethering clarity to visual discourse communities, convention-building, cultural values, and power. The concept of clarity has been further reoriented by the rhetoric of participation, which is fostered by interactive digital design that enables users to adapt displays according to their needs and interests. © 2007 IEEE.""This study was undertaken to obtain feedback from former students of business communication. Above-average achievers in business communica tion classes in three institutions between 1959 and the present were sent questionnaires. Returns indicated that these respondents write regularly on the job (79 percent); they believe that ability to write well is important to success (89 percent); and they believe written communication should be taught because little writing is required in other courses, and well-written communication may be the only avenue to recognition for a new employee. © 1976, Sage Publications.

Studies of conversational storytelling have demonstrated that narrators not only relate events and conditions but also indicate the significance of their stories by means of story evaluations; that is, they highlight the points of their stories in various ways, such as suspending the story, making overt comments about the importance of an event, and repeating certain key words or phrases. This article demonstrates how story evaluations can reveal a story’s significance within an organizational setting by examining two narratives from research interviews that form part of the data in a study of readers’ responses to writing in a marketing organization. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

To the surprise of the experimenter and perhaps of the reader of this article—the variables test ed did not cause differences in the effectiveness of the mes sage. Possible reasons for this are postulated and preliminary results of a follow-on experi ment are indicated. © 1969, Sage Publications.

This paper examines the technologies employed in using the Web, including software and hardware concerns, and the uses to which the organization can employ the technology. A case study of how the College of Journalism and Communications at the University of Florida developed and is using the Web provides additional illustration of the Web's potentials for internal and external communication. The paper concludes with a brief description of organizational and legal issues which have been spawned by use of the Web. © 1996 IEEE.""This empirical study examines whether independent technical communicators' Web portfolios are worthwhile and how technical communicators manage to post work for clients on their own Web sites. Method: The study surveyed 240 independent contractors, consultants, and principals of small businesses that maintain Web sites to market their technical communication services, briefly interviewed half of them, and analyzed posted samples of their work. Results: Results reveal the extent to which posted work samples are useful in marketing technical communication services, and how the numbers of such samples are associated with their overall usefulness. Results also reveal how independent technical communicators overcome such challenges as clients' concerns about proprietary information, confidentiality, and intellectual property in order to post their work. Conclusion: These results carry implications not only for how independent technical communicators disseminate a portfolio of their work but also for how any technical communicators would develop portfolios of their work for employment, academic credentials, or professional certification.""U.S. business organizations are beset by numerous conflicting pressures emanating from a wide variety of sources. One characteristic of a healthy organization is the ability to adapt to the pressures.

To make the consulting experience successful and to understand the communication problems in an organization, the consultant should be aware of how the organization's culture may affect communication practices of members and should learn to read the various signs of organizational culture. Effective reading of cultural signs may be critical to the consultant's success or failure. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The impasse between different factions in the univer sity concerning the nature of good writing, who should teach it, and the proper function of language; 2. the available talent for teaching writing and the university structure within which it is taught; 3. the coming crises in the ability of business to cope with the information explosion. Sug gested as a first move to redefining the problem is better communication among all those involved in teaching language, writing, and information science; only then can strategies for reversing the decline in language mastery be devised and implemented. © 1980, Sage Publications.

This study is based on sec ondary research, examination of documents written by nurse managers, and interviews with 54 nurse managers and 13 nurse educators. It indicates that writing a variety of business communications is a crucial career task jor nurse managers, directly affecting their professional power. However, most nurse managers interviewed believed their undergraduate education had not pre pared them adequately for their workplace writing and perceived a need for professional writing instruction in four-year nursing programs. © 1996 By the Association for Business Communication.""The job market today is extremely competitive, and students must design cover letters and resumes that catch the attention of prospective employers. They must design documents that are brief, yet action packed. Because of the length and repetitive nature of much of the information included in the traditional application letter and resume, many employers seem to favor a more nontraditional approach. The nontraditional application letter would be only two or three paragraphs in length. Students must stress what they have to offer the employer by emphasizing skills they possess and responsibilities they can handle. The nontraditional resume should be tailored to fit the needs of a particular employer. If the students have a good understanding of the organizations for which they desire to work, they will be able to emphasize those aspects of their education and previous work experience that would be beneficial for the position they desire. Taking initiative, showing creativity, and being assertive can make the difference in being invited for those very important interviews. © 1991, Sage Publications.

The reader of such prose often feels welcome to ship whole pages, since he'll likely hear it all again on another page. Thus the repetition device is ultimately inefficient, annoying, inelegant, and counterproductive. This article examines theoretical and empirical work in related fields pertaining to the issue of repetition in discourse, and pertaining specifically to the issue of designing effective, unrepetitive openings for business and technical reports. © 1983, Sage Publications.

Recent progress in computer science and artificial intelligence research is used specify the nature of the modules in the system. The processing of a sample text is observed during the phases of reading and writing a report on the origin of sunspots. The author advances some proposals for correlating syntax and semantics of English from a procedural standpoint. The discussion is illustrated with structural diagrams.""The article focuses on the utilization of reader benefits in business communication. It states that reader benefits are essential in business communication as they can influence the recipient's attitude and behavior. It mentions that reader benefits also serve as a form of positive reinforcement for employees due to their ability to function as verbal motivational tool. It comments on why threats are ineffective in influencing behavior due to a variety of reasons, including the fact the threats only work when the employee is under observation, the fact they eliminate behaviors rather than encourage desired responses, and because punishment is perceived as aggression and can provoke a counter aggressive response.""Conclusions on how to handle organizational emergencies are almost always based on experiences learned from strategies successful in previous emergencies. This information, however, usually only explains what organizations should do, not why they do it. This paper takes a first step toward examining emergency communication from a theoretical point of view. Relevant theories from the social sciences are identified and analyzed as they apply to organizational emergencies. These theories are suggested as a necessary supplement to strategies already available from first-hand experience. © 1989 IEEE""For too long, journal articles and textbooks on scientific and technical discourse have adopted a positivistic approach to visuals. Unfortunately, this approach is problematic. It ignores that visuals are constructions that are products of a writer's interpretation with its own power-laden agenda. For example, in representing a tamed and dominated nature, visuals become instruments of patriarchy. Reading them responsibly requires that we uncover some of the values attached to the strategies of creating visuals and to the objects created. This article reviews the current approach taken by composition scholars, surveys richer interdisciplinary work on visuals, and- by using visuals connected with the Human Genome Project - models an analysis of visuals as rhetoric.""This study reports the results of 12 recent interviews with nonnative-English-speaking (NNES) authors who have conducted research and written articles on health and medical subjects. Analyzing the interview transcripts through the theoretical lens of Pierre Bourdieu’s forms of capital, this study expands on previous research by offering a more precise and theoretically grounded understanding of how NNES authors perceive the value of English proficiency in relation to their success as scientific researchers. This theorization of the varying ways in which authors perceive the value of English proficiency affords new perspectives on the inequities that NNES authors encounter in the global publishing economy and their rhetorical strategies for overcoming these inequities. The study concludes by reflecting on theoretical and practical implications for researchers, teachers, and other stakeholders in the global publishing industry. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.""Business and technical communication have conventionally been separated in academe—a separation that formalist rhetorical theory has supported. Epistemic rhetorical theory, however, suggests that this separation does not reflect the profession's current understanding of workplace discourse. This article demonstrates that the labels business and technical communication are not helpful in understanding two workplace documents: a memorandum and a report. The article then explores the increased explanatory power in two epistemic theoretical approaches, social construction and paralogic hermeneutics, after which the article discusses the radical implications of these approaches for a curricular dialogue concerning workplace writing. Finally, the article describes interests inside and outside academe that preserve the status quo and thus mitigate against curricular change, positing that such change would be difficult, but not impossible, to achieve. © 1993, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The Stop (Sequential Thematic Organization of Proposals) technique applies five principles to solve this problem: It (1) recognizes the passage unit of discourse to gain expository-descriptive coherence; (2) uses the essay (with thesis sentence) to enhance strategic discussion; (3) restricts outlining to establishing topical architecture and introduces prewriting (via storyboards) to discover and exercise argument, explanation, and visualization; (4) uses prereviewing (via real-time, walk-through group dynamics) to permit team/corporate review of the story plan prior to manuscript drafting; and (5) stresses group writing to infuse both the marketing and the technical strategy and design approach into the document. The paper reviews the principles, practices (including misconceptions), and lessons of STOP as developed, refined, and learned during twenty years. 8 refs.""A conscious and organized study of editing processes can introduce basic editorial values to technical communication students. Through research and practice, students can learn systematic methods of editing with levels of edit (or types of edit) for written manuscripts and with editorial dialogue for conferring with writers. This work can lead to development of individual theories and practices of editing. Seven 'levels of edit' are tabulated with questions related to each type. The levels shown, with brief explanation, are: Content: Knowledge of subject matter and transfer of that knowledge, information, or message; Structure: Organization of whole piece of writing, of each section, and of each paragraph with clear beginnings, middle parts, and endings; Style: Pattern of sentences and use of words; Format: Specialized physical arrangement and appearance; Mechanics: Use of language according to established rules of grammar; Tone: Voice or persona of the writer; Policy: Conventions that the writer should follow for a journal, company, or organization. The Appendix lists 143 'selected resources on editing processes' (books, papers, journal articles).""A conscious understanding of writing processes can be developed through experiencing and researching different writing processes. One approach involves examining present writing behaviors, experiencing very diverse writing processes, and researching published materials on writing process to improve and develop one's own theory and practice of writing in technical communication.""The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between organizational theory and its application in the design and utilization of communication technology. Scientific management principles, which still permeate many aspects of modern organizations, result in an implementation of technology which fails to take full advantage of the potential both of people as organization members and of the technology itself. In contrast, in a sociotechnical systems approach based on systems theory, technology is designed and implemented in ways which enhance the potential of both individuals and the technology itself, in accordance with organizational needs. The need for statements of policy and mechanisms for participation are discussed followed by consequences of a shift to a sociotechnical systems approach, such as a focus on work teams and networked organizations. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""The article outlines a system of classifying communications whereby such factors as retention time of the material, value of communication, and distribution policy within the organization are discussed. Communications are received by management. They are properly classified by the appropriate color code to allow management to know which is most important and needs a more immediate response. With the implementation of the system, management should begin to realize a savings in time and cost as well as removal of any embarrassment from delays in answering important communications.""When games are approached as a pedagogical methodology, the homologies between games and technical communication are highlighted: pedagogy that teaches people to play and succeed within certain confines; classroom assessment that provides meaningful feedback to encourage self-improvement; instructional design that incorporates gaming theory and game design principles; and usability to ensure optimum success. This article provides an overview of these topics for instructors to consider when designing a technical writing course as a game. © The Author(s) 2015.""There is little research on the use of titles in academic articles, and even less on different types of titles. In this article Crosby's taxonomy of titles [1] is brought up-to date and extended. Twelve types of titles are distinguished. The author argues that it would be helpful to discuss these different types with student writers.""The introduction of international financial reporting regulations has caused European multinationals to be increasingly reliant on the nonfinancial multimodal sections of the annual report as a means of informing and persuading international stakeholders. Due to the growing status of English as an international financial communication language, moreover, these annual report sections are usually produced in English. This experimental study compares the effectiveness of texts and photos in Dutch-English and British-English management statements from the perspective of financial analysts in the UK. The research results largely confirm the similarity-attraction hypothesis: Among UK-based analysts, typically British communication features often yield a more positive effect than the features that are typical of the Dutch-based statements. © 2010 IEEE."Spent activated carbon loaded with phenol was continuously regenerated in a packed fluidized bed with open-end cylindrical screen packing in a steam-nitrogen atmosphere. The weight loss of the regenerated carbon in a packed fluidized bed was analyzed by a two phase model for gas-solid contacting and perfect mixing for solid mixing in the bed with the empirical equation for the weight loss rate of spent activated carbon in a steam-nitrogen atmosphere. The adsorption capacity of the regenerated carbon was estimated by Iodine number."We report on an exploratory experimental comparison of two different thinking aloud approaches in a usability test that focused on navigation problems in a highly nonstandard website. One approach is a rigid application of the E&S procedure, as explained in Protocol Analysis in 1993. The other is derived from the B&R proposal based on speech communication and published in this Transactions in September, 2000. The latter approach differs from the former in that the experimenter has more room for acknowledging (mm-hmm) contributions from subjects and has the possibility of asking for clarifications and offering encouragement. Comparing the verbal reports obtained with these two methods, we find that the process of thinking aloud while carrying out tasks is not affected by the type of approach that was used. The task performance does differ. More tasks were completed in the B&R condition, and subjects were less lost. Nevertheless, subjects' evaluations of the website quality did not differ, nor did the number of different navigation problems that were detected.""In usability testing of websites, thinking aloud is a frequently used method. A fundamental discussion, however, about the relation between the use of different variants of thinking aloud and the evaluation goals for this specific medium is still lacking. To lay a foundation for this discussion, I analyzed the results of three usability studies in which different thinking-aloud tasks were used: a simple searching task, an application task, and a prediction task. In the task setting the profile of the Web-surfer, the communication goal of the website and other quality aspects are taken into account. The qualitative analysis of these studies shows that the task variation has some influence on the results of usability testing and that, consequently, tasks should be matched with the evaluation goals put forward.""Thinking-aloud protocols may be the most widely used method in usability testing, but the descriptions of this practice in the usability literature and the work habits of practitioners do not conform to the theoretical basis most often cited for it: Ericsson and Simon's seminal work PROTOCOL ANALYSIS: VERBAL REPORTS AS DATA. After reviewing Ericsson and Simon's theoretical basis for thinking aloud, we review the ways in which actual usability practice diverges from this model. We then explore the concept of SPEECH GENRE as an alternative theoretical framework. We first consider uses of this new framework that are consistent with Simon and Ericsson's goal of eliciting a verbal report that is as undirected, undisturbed, and constant as possible. We then go on to consider how the proposed new approach might handle problems that arise in usability testing that appear to require interventions not supported in the older model.""On-line publication alters the relationship between editor and writer, creating a potentially more collaborative and fluid text. This article explores implications of increased publication options and examines conceptual distinctions among Fixed-Format, Electronic, and Meta-media Editors. We propose a keyboard editing/commenting technique that will work across platforms and software programs and in every mode of electronic communication including simple e-mail. This ASCII based system uses only four symbols in various combinations to convey all of the print editor's marks and also allows the editor or reader to insert comments in the immediate context. The result is increased efficiency and flexibility for writer and editor or teacher and student.""Rhetorical voice is rarely discussed in business, professional, or technical communication textbooks, despite its strategic importance in aligning writer and audience so that persuasion can occur.

The authors discuss variation in two genres: meeting minutes and internal memos. Adopting a social constructionist, communities of practice (CofP) approach, they argue that the companies form overarching constellations of CofP. Although the participants broadly work with the same genres of written documents, the form of these documents varies according to the local context, audience, and purpose. The authors discuss the implications of their findings, with particular reference to the difficulty writers face when they make the transition from writing for one community of practice to writing for another. © 2008 Sage Publications.""The author comments on the use of graphic information systems, i. e. , signs.

It identifies the role of the speech in the technical context, provides plan-ahead notes and a choice of three sets of simplified guidelines for speech organization, and compares the needs and rewards of the self-contained speech, the technical society talk, and the presentation. Finishing, polishing, and rehearsing are discussed, with emphasis on oral-versus-written words and the use of humor. The reader is directed to a friendly, supportive environment for speaking practice. Final delivery is treated, with tips on establishing audience rapport.""Provides a historic overview of research on printed software tutorials.

For the first time, an overview is presented of the current design conventions for children's informational Web sites. Method: In this study a large corpus of 100 children's international, informational Web sites from four different domains (science, pets, arts, and health) is analyzed. The instrument for analyzing the Web sites included categories on visual design, navigation and information architecture. Results: The design conventions identified in this study show that designers of children's informational Web sites often follow general Web design guidelines. This study also shows that there is still much confusion about how to design Web sites for children. A closer look at the data revealed three categories of informational Web sites especially designed for children, diverging from a classical to a playful design approach. Conclusion: An overview is presented of the current design conventions for children's informational Web sites. The identified design conventions should be further tested and validated as design standards for children's informational Web design. Further, the design of children's informational Web sites is determined by two dimensions of aesthetics; classical and expressive. In this study, expressive aesthetics results in playful visual design or in a total playful interaction design. The effects of playful design on children's affect and cognition will be an important topic in future research on children's digital search behavior.""A technical writing course can simulate the work situation and develop in students the uniquely human faculty of imagination. Whole-group effort is needed to sustain the fiction that the course is a job. Special presentation by the instructor of traditional assignments is essential. Such a course prepares students for demands made on the job. More importantly, the course, by emphasizing the act of imagining, enables students to progress from fitting facts into given formats to designing reports for specific communication situations. Because of this emphasis on imagination, the course is a humanities offering as well as a technical complement.""Studies how one entrepreneur acquired, applied, and fit frames to her startup venture and stakeholders over one year. Research questions: How do pitchers acquire frames for pitches? How do pitchers apply frames to existing pitches? How do pitchers gauge the fit between the innovation, frames, and stakeholders? Literature review: The literature examined - framing professional communication, developing pitches, and framing pitches - stresses the relationship between framing, agency, and deliberation. However, few studies approach data from the perspective of the pitcher and few frames outside of the problem-solution frame are considered. Methodology: This autoethnography analyzes data from more than 500 pages of field notes, 60 minutes of video-recorded pitch sessions, 25 interviews with pitch stakeholders, and various textual artifacts that pertained to Author 1's nonprofit startup organization, Hacker Gals. Themes in the data were identified and analyzed through the composition of analytic memos. Frames were identified and analyzed through close reading and holistic interpretation. Results and conclusions: The entrepreneur acquired the most influential frames through stakeholder discussion, applied these frames in a way that stacked and made salient multiple frames beyond the problem-solution frame, and judged frame fit by considering the degree to which catchers took up the frames. The study's results suggest that the practice of frame stacking might increase pitch effectiveness by mitigating troubled identifications. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Genre use entails a rhetorical response to an exigence in the writer's context. In one category of genres, which the author calls temporal genres, linear time constitutes a major exigence to which writers must respond. Temporal genres, such as annual reports and status reports, call for writers to publish texts because a certain amount of time has passed, even if they are not yet ready to do so. The first annual report of the Privacy Office of the Department of Homeland Security reveals an ineffective ethos and discontinuities between the mission of the office and that of the department. But the second annual report reveals a more effective ethos and greater harmony between the missions. This study shows how the requirement to report can force writers to decide existential issues of identity and mission. © 2009 Sage Publications.""This article brings together the communication needs and positioning of women in technical areas, and asks ""how can technical communication classes contribute to the mentoring of young women engineers at a time when many of those women want to be identified as engineers instead of being spotlighted as women in engineering?"" Incorporating research into mentoring for women in engineering, and feminist approaches to mentoring in general, we adopt Heath and Heath's strategy in Switch, instituting small changes in technical communication classes (and sometimes their infrastructures) that target a mentoring problem - i.e., talk about time - with the hope of flipping a switch toward larger changes. Thus, the article demonstrates two tactics that we can use to deliver improvement in managing the discourse surrounding time and its deadlines. Our approach both mentors undergraduate women in more actively and effectively discussing and scheduling their work without singling them out as women and also integrates good mentoring practice into the infrastructure of technical communication service classes. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This paper details the development of an industrial training curriculum at Albany International Corporation, including the development of technical video as an important part of the program.

The relationship between organizational socialization practices and organizational temporality is empirically explored through a questionnaire focusing on Ballard and Seibold's temporality dimensions and measures emphasizing structural dimensions of socialization tactics. Findings indicate that the perception of time as scarce is related to organizational members' development of formal structures that promote socialization of newcomers. Further, findings suggest that organizational members holding a future temporal focus may engage in the development of formal socialization structures that provide social support for newcomers and help newcomers predict their career path within the organization. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""This paper illuminates a nonverbal dimension of public speaking: time. In this sense time has four aspects: order, cycle, depth, and rhythm. The specific ways time is thus used in communication are demonstrated. If used properly, these aspects of time blend into an effective communication tool, allowing for more meaningful message sharing between speaker and listener.""Technical communicators - both writers and editors - should know their inherent abilities, and how these abilities interface with related occupations. Publications supervisors and managers can also benefit from this knowledge by applying it to improve their units' functional efficiency. By using the Job and Talent Matrix - occupation blocks fitted into a lattice of aptitudes - one can define the general attributes of technical writers/editors, and establish their interrelationships with people from associated professions such as engineers.""Successful public speaking depends on careful preparation and proper delivery. The preparation involves understanding your audience (by asking certain questions and jotting down single-sentence answers) and knowing the physical setting for your talk (time, place, mood, and atmosphere). Writing the material calls for putting yourself in the position of the audience and asking, ″What would I like to hear?″ Other suggestions include (1) writing the conclusion first; (2) being graphic, current, and specific; and (3) using suspense, novelty, and humor.""The Research Committee of ABCA worked long and hard to compile this list which it is hoped may some day, in expanded form, find a publisher.

Guidelines are offered to help management decide between the benefits and the deterrents to publication.""This study analyzes the performance and attitudes of technical writing students in PowerPoint-enhanced and in non-PowerPoint lectures. Four classes of upper-level undergraduates (n = 84) at a mid-sized, Southern university taking a one-semester technical writing course were surveyed at the beginning and end of the course about their perceptions of PowerPoint. Of the four sections, two classes were instructed using traditional lecture materials (teacher at podium, chalkboard, handouts); the other two sections were instructed with PowerPoint presentations. All four classes were given the same pre- and post-test to measure performance over the course of the semester. Traditional lecture or PowerPoint presentations consisted of at least 50% of the course, with the remaining time spent on exercises and small group work. Results reveal that while most students say they preferred PowerPoint, performance scores were higher in the sections with the traditional lecture format.""Participants read a standard orienting statement describing the founding, current business, and policies of a fictitious corporation. Half of the read ers studied the original statement, which was written in terms of a “flexi ble” approach to organizational structure. The remaining half of the sample read a modified version in which three percent of the original words had been changed toward a “strict” tone of communication. After reading, both groups rated the organization in terms of how they perceived its atti tude toward social responsibility, labor relations, and personal values. The three-percent wording change toward the strict climate significantly influ enced the amount of negative ratings, with people in the strict wording group consistently seeing the organization’s climate as less pleasant and more restrictive. These results indicate that management should take great care in structuring even the most general communications since very small changes in wording can lead to substantial shifts in attitude about the organization. © 1981, Sage Publications.

Topics include perspective, focusing, camera stability, light-bouncing, and film processing, and these are discussed in the context of ″hardware″ considerations.""'Top-down' communication (i. e. , from executives to large groups of employees) is part of the process of managing a corporation or other complex organization. Top-down messages convey management's 'corporate vision'; unify a corporation's diverse businesses; and generally implement corporate and business strategies. The challenges of top-down communication as seen by executive communicators--specialists who work closely with senior managers to prepare speeches, policy statements, directives, and related materials--are explored.""In a society in which expertise becomes increasingly specialized, we need to understand how to manage gaps in knowledge between experts in various fields and between experts and the public in general. That need is especially great in the public sphere, where technical understanding and lived experience do not always align. This study attempts to model the process by which discipline-specific topoi filter into common knowledge and general topoi are acknowledged by experts. It first addresses the issue of expertise in complex rhetorical places, then employs Michel Meyer's reinterpretation of ethos, pathos, and logos to show how experts and non-experts in such places negotiate rhetorical relationships. The study then explores the social and rhetorical mechanisms by which ideas become commonplaces, building on the established theory of symbolic convergence. Finally, the study demonstrates proof in principle with a brief analysis of one topos in the Reports of the Immigration Commission (1911). © 2015, The Author(s).""The author argues that technical writers need to pay close attention to writing good headings because headings not only provide information to users but also motivate users to examine a document. Writing a good heading is a rhetorical action; that is, the writer first determines how the writer wants users to perceive the document and then uses language and structure to project that image.""The primary journal is the true repository of the original scientific and technological data. The secondary service provides access to that original data; it does not replace it; it is not a surrogate. Experiments to date include the exchange of abstracts, index entries, and uniform bibliographic citations; also, the simultaneous editorial processing of the primary manuscript and the required secondary records. In the latter example, it is possible to produce primary journal indexes automatically from the secondary service database and to plan for one-time keyboarding of specific input data needed by both services. Large computer composition systems developed for the needs of secondary services are now composing primary journals economically.""Business communication research on reader analysis has stagnated. This article examines why current business communication theory and practice makes new inroads into reader analysis difficult. To account for this lack of new critical thinking, the article assesses the field's confusion about critical terminology, its poor heuristics for assessing readers, its oversimplified cases, and its misleading message classification system. In addition, the article explores a new factor in reader analysis—readers' perceptual sets—as a way o f more accurately modeling the dynamics of the writer-reader relationship. © 1988, Sage Publications.

The persons best equipped by training and experience to explain and describe the problems of communications, the professors of business communications, are not meeting the challenge.""This paper makes a strong case for a comprehensive listing of technical writing publications. An introduction to the main thesis establishes the importance of technical writing both academically and professionally. A strong bibliography would provide a mine of information for both teachers and technical writers,""Research has indicated technical and professional communicators (TPCs) continue to struggle with establishing value in the workplace. Studies advocate for more effective communication with management, but scholarship has yet to adequately address the relationship between establishing and explaining value and management philosophy. This article takes up the two issues of workplace value and “speaking the language of business” as they relate to management efficiency philosophy, specifically Lean and Six Sigma. I argue that management philosophy, particularly efficiency philosophies, is an integral, yet often overlooked, aspect of organizational context that affects both organizational structures and cultures. Method: I share the results of an ethnographic study of a series of trainings that were part of a Lean initiative. I buttress these observations with two documents, one internal and one customer-facing, from Lean Six Sigma initiatives. Results: The trainings illustrate the work of creating an organizational culture and the importance of communication in developing a sustainable Lean culture. The two documents are examples of how processes and workflow (e.g., organizational structures) are written in efficiency environments. Conclusion: Practitioners and researchers should see efficiency management philosophies as important components of organizational contexts not to be glossed over. Communication is acknowledged as important to maintaining culture, but TPC knowledge and expertise are not necessarily recognized. The two documents show opportunities in these kinds of cultures to make work visible and establish value. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

However, in the last four decades, contextual factors such as economic globalization trend and the advances of communication technologies are changing our ways of interacting with others. As a result our understanding of culture and cultural differences need to be adjusted. In this research, I start by recommending a workable definition of culture in the present context-culture as a process, which establishes a foundation for cross-cultural rhetorical research in the new era when communication across cultures transcends national boundaries. Based on the critical perspective of culture, I continue to point out the limitations of contrastive rhetoric and argue that contrastive rhetoric's view of culture and its research purpose and methodology need to be modified to overcome its constraints and better meet the needs of the present social context.""Although the usefulness of evaluating documents has become generally accepted among communication professionals, the supporting research that puts evaluation practices empirically to the test is only beginning to emerge. This article presents an overview of the available research on troubleshooting evaluation methods. Four lines of research are distinguished concerning the validity of evaluation methods, sample composition, sample size, and the implementation of evaluation results during revision.""This article extends current thinking about the rhetoric of technology by making a preliminary inquiry into what a feminist rhetoric of technology might look like. On the basis of feminist critiques of technology in various disciplines, the author suggests three ways in which feminist approaches to building a rhetoric of technology might differ from current nonfeminist approaches to this task. First, feminist scholars should adopt a more expansive definition of technology than that which informs current rhetoric of technology research. Second, feminist scholars should ask research questions different from those being asked by current rhetoric of technology researchers. Third, feminist scholars should move beyond the design and development phases of technology, which most of the current research on the rhetoric of technology emphasizes.""Recent studies of technical communication practice have suggested that writing documents is no longer the focus of technical-communication work. To test these suggestions and our own suspicion that technical communication work is now richly multi-dimensional, we conducted a series of focus groups of experienced practitioners. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results confirm that, while technical communicators still write documents for internal and external clients, they spend at least equal amounts of time working on teams and planning and facilitating communication processes, not just products. These findings have implications for the metaphors by which technical communicators and their employers conceive of technical communication work and its value. The images and metaphors we collected suggest that successful communicators are functioning or poised to function at the core of their companies’ business and strategic processes. These findings also have implications for technical communication curricula, which must ensure that their courses and projects are educating technical communicators for this new, dynamic, participative work.""Increased demand for user experience (UX) designers requires new approaches to teaching and training the next generation of these professionals. We present a model for building educational programs within academia that train job-ready designers. Key concepts: To be successful, this model necessitates a working knowledge of the UX process, the systematic use of sound principles during the design of digital products and services. The model also requires a pedagogical approach that puts learners in a position to solve real problems and that treats them as apprentices on their way to competency. Key lessons: Academic institutions clearly have parts to play in producing job-ready UX designers, but barriers exist to doing so, including access to adequate training in UX best practices. To overcome these barriers, we provide tips for understanding core UX competencies, developing partnerships with UX practitioners, and deploying UX education courses and programs. Implications: Though the barriers to producing sufficient numbers of well-trained UX designers are significant, the combined ingenuity of devoted professionals in both academia and industry can be leveraged to create sound educational opportunities for UX learners from all walks of life. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Distribution of documents in electronic form, often called soft copy, permits more rapid sharing of information and the acceleration of new knowledge; however, barriers to soft-copy document distribution have arisen out of the diversity of the tools currently available in publishing technology. The authors address solving these problems by means of the development of a public font standard, and novel tools and services. They describe a cooperative effort now under way among graphic arts professionals, representatives of industry, and national and international standards-making organizations to develop such a standard along with the associated tools and services.""Courses in intercultural communication often put non-Western students at a dis advantage. In developing a course with a majority of non-Western participants at The University of Waikato, we adapted critical pedagogy to address the Western biases in the texts and approaches of intercultural communication. We selected both mainstream and alternative readings that allowed students to connect the field's neo-colonial business present with its colonialist past, to question the ethics and efficacy of an often skewed territorialisation of knowledge; and to redress tra ditional distortions by introducing perspectives from a range of critical and post colonial theorists. The readings were reinforced by student presentations of their own experiences crossing cultural borders. These experiences were then assessed in class, so that we didn't rely on the simulated experiences recorded in the conven tional texts. © 2001, Sage Publications.

These chemical and photo-mechanically reproduced images often functioned as the basis for carefully defined claims for truth. In the natural sciences, in microscopy, in medicine, in the emerging studies of psychology and the social sciences, and in the dissemination and promotion of technological accomplishments, the verity of early published photographs led authors to claim that an image could be equal to its referent in nature, or even exceed its referent when conveying scientific and technical information. This article presents a technological, cultural, and rhetorical history of published photographs based upon twenty-three images selected from a review of forty photographically illustrated texts published between 1854 and 1900.""This article proposes a model of organizational change by describing change as a discursive process, sparked by a conflict in an organization's narratives and images. As such, change is the process of realigning an organization's discordant narratives and images. Several implications that the model has for organizational communication and for the study of organizational change are presented.""This article explores the social meaning of locale in mobile communication research and introduces an approach of user localization to study technology integration. It investigates how locale forms an essential role in mobile communication in the way that practice, agency, and identities are articulated into a user localization process of incorporating technology into user's everyday life. It argues that the use of mobile communication technology is both a complex and dynamic interaction with its surrounding social, cultural, technological, and economic conditions, and an articulation work of self and locale.""Studies of corporate reporting that focus on information disclosure do so primarily from a mandatory, financial perspective owing the decision to the rationality of corporate actors. Yet, social and environmental disclosures-often reported voluntarily-are increasing in importance because of their impact on a firm's performance and perceived value. Likewise, disclosure decisions are made based on managerial choice, often being communicated for a specific strategic purpose. The aim of this article is to illuminate the importance of voluntary disclosures as an aspect of corporate reporting and to integrate the deterministic and behavioral elements of disclosure decisions. A taxonomy of the disclosure process, activities, tasks, forms, types, and strategies is provided to add to our understanding of the additive and corrective nature of proactively disclosing information either to provide context to existing disclosures or to use information in a preventive manner. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""To develop and present a systematic, hierarchical taxonomy of visuals used in science communication, in order to facilitate analysis as well as selection and design of visuals. Methods: Iterative analysis of commonly used visuals and existing typologies and selection of a classification system. Results: A taxonomy is proposed based on Linnean principles, which distinguishes three classes of visuals based on their information and sign content; these are subdivided in orders and families. A systematic nomenclature is described. Conclusions: Used successfully in training sessions and research, the taxonomy offers the basis for the development of comprehensive guidelines and improvements in the design and usage of visuals.""The primary purpose of this paper is to facilitate a more systematic approach to develop ment of a single theory of ad ministration from the present formal and informal theories. It limits its focus to deter mining when the use of formal communication channels, infor mal channels or some combina tion thereof contributes to the effectiveness of the administra tor and when verbal, written or some combination of these methods facilitate an admini strator's effectiveness when using the formal and informal networks. Clarification of the alternatives available to the ad ministrator is attained by the specification of channels and methods of using them.

But AT-based studies typically emphasize the uniqueness of activities rather than examining how certain types of activities share configurations. Consequently, these analyses often miss the chance to examine activities’ internal contradictions that are a result of interference between different configurations of activity. This article argues that a typology of activities can deepen our understanding of these internal contradictions. Drawing from a range of literature, it describes the general characteristics of different types of activities, providing examples from other AT-based studies. It concludes by discussing how this typology can help such studies to better analyze internal contradictions in activities. © The Author(s) 2014.""This article discusses the development of a unified social theory of genre learning based on the integration of rhetorical genre studies, activity theory, and the situated learning perspective. The article proposes that these three theoretical perspectives are compatible and complementary, and it illustrates applications of a unified framework to a study of genre learning by novice engineers. The author draws examples from a longitudinal qualitative study of a group of novice engineers who developed their professional genre knowledge through both academic and workplace experiences. These examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the study of professional genre learning. © 2008 Sage Publications.""While there have been measurable improvements in the technical development of multimedia, research from a sociotechnical viewpoint suggests that the benefits of multimedia technology, especially in fulfilling user requirements, do not always live up to initial promises. This paper aims to address one of the fundamental, but often neglected, areas in user requirements, i.e., gender-related issues. The paper identifies and discusses gender differences in multimedia communication and suggests how the differences can be addressed. It proposes a model for accommodating gender differences in multimedia communication.""This article explores the challenges and opportunities that the rising numbers of students with disabilities and the changing definition of disability pose to technical communication teachers and researchers.

Reactions to the advent and abuse of image-adjustment software (such as Adobe Photoshop) reveal the complex relations among visual representations, scientific credibility, and epistemic rhetoric.

This research describes key characteristics of Arabic persuasion by reviewing the extant research and analyzing the persuasion dynamics between a U.S. organization and a Jordanian organization attempting to form a service partnership. Both the literature and results from the case study indicate that Arabic persuasion strategies differ in fundamental ways from U.S. and Western strategies. Various forms of repetition, highly metaphoric language, and strong emotion characterize Arabic persuasion norms when using Arabic and English. These norms are created by the linguistic characteristics of Classical Arabic, the close connection between the Arabic language and Islam, and the social and political hierarchies that shape Arabic interaction. © The Author(s) 2014.""Empirical studies of gender-based language differences have provided conflicting, discreet conclusions that have little relevance for business-communications instruction. This paper presents informally collected observations of male and female students in undergraduate and graduate business-and technical-communication courses. Calling for future formal studies to verify its findings, this study concludes that people-intensive work experience modifies gender-based language differences in written business communications of undergraduate and graduate students. However, instruction in audience analysis, tone, content design, and style also modify these gender differences. If formally supported, these observations would help teachersargue for the value of business-communications instruction in helping students develop varied and androgynous communication styles important for job-related communications. © 1990, Sage Publications.

This paper discusses inaccurate uses of the term ""case study"" and then presents ideas for conducting more rigorous case studies. Advantages and disadvantages are described, as well as typical techniques, such as interviews, logs, and visual and verbal protocols.""Meetings are potentially the best means of communication between managers and the people who report to them. Often, however, meeting time is misused and unproductive. The author suggests that in planning your next meeting you consider group size, check the meeting place before the meeting convenes, and prepare and distribute an agenda. Tips are given on guiding the discussions, handling behavior problems, establishing rules of order, and voting.""Communication during tough times necessitates response. More appropriately, it necessitates continuous response. This paper presents a case study conducted over a six month period that focuses on an internal Communications Process Improvement (CPI) initiative called “Toward Better Two-Way” that was carried out in a manufacturing division of a Fortune 100 company. The initiative developed an active, two-way communication channel in a setting where exchanges between managers and employees had been infrequent and ineffective. © 1993 IEEE""Technical communication inherited many of the stylistic conventions adhered to within scientific discourse. This article examines current theories and research that support the contention that some of these conventions should no longer be applied across the board. In particular, the effect of analogy and direct address (2nd person versus 3rd person) on novices' comprehension and experts'preference are discussed and evaluated through a series of controlled experiments. The results of these experiments suggest that analogies have a tremendous effect upon the ability of readers to freely recall material at a later time. Direct address does not appear to affect comprehension, although subject-matter experts preferred 2nd-person to 3rd-person sentence construction. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Yet, a critical examination of the field methods of UCD suggests that they suffer from unintegrated scope: an undesirably limiting focus on a particular level of scope (either the macroscopic level of human activity or the mesoscopic level of goal-directed action) in their theoretical underpinnings and data collection and analysis. This focus is often paired with the assumption that this particular level of scope causally affects what happens at the other levels. Both the focus and the assumption are at odds with sociocultural theories of human activity. This article lays out the problem of unintegrated scope and examines it through critical analyses of two field methods used in UCD research. It concludes by proposing an integrated-scope research methodology for UCD research, with roots in both sodocultural theory and the central issues of technical communication.""The author describes his efforts to develop international communication as an academic subject matter, and describes the historical development of studies in the various fields of Business English and Business Communication in Japan.""Through the past several years, the emphasis in education has shifted from a teacher-centered to a learner-centered approach. Traditional teaching has too often been based on a passive lecture model, dependent on an expert teacher who funnels knowledge into the somewhat retentive minds of students. More current learning theory suggests a different role for teachers-that of facilitators. Based on research about how people learn, this article advocates that teachers use more active, inductive instruction in the classroom and demonstrates a student-centered approach using classroom examples implemented in a required, college-level business communication course. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article asks what can be learned about knowledge flows in the field of technical communication from the networking activities that independent entrepreneurs use to learn relevant information, influence practice, and build professional conversations. Method: The article uses qualitative methods informed by theories of social network analysis to examine interview data collected from eight successful technical communication entrepreneurs. Results: Technical communication entrepreneurs actively publish and read publications to learn relevant information about the field, influence practice, and build professional conversations. Academic publications are often outside these entrepreneurs’ scope of interest because of differing timescales, venues, and key terms; however, they often read publications of and publish toward the professional networks generated as they connect with others for business interests. Conclusion: The field must continue to find ways to bridge academic and practitioner divides by seeking common venues, shared timelines, and collaborating on emerging topics of interest. However, these divides are more complex than simply among academics and practitioners, as knowledge flows in the field have become multidirectional rather than two-sided. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Economic and academic pressures often make this difficult. A degree in modern English studied is planned which attempts to combine traditional academic values and functional needs. A new approach to rhetoric combining linguistic and critical disciplines with practical skills in communication can combine liberal and vocational needs. The course content of the degree and the teaching approach is related to the ethos of a technological university."Distributed work is an increasingly common phenomenon in a number of technical and professional settings, and the complexity of this work requires high degrees of knowledge sharing and integration that move beyond assembly-line approaches to collaboration. Since participants in distributed-work settings rely almost exclusively on written and spoken language to mediate their collaborative relationships, professional communication faculty need educational approaches that empower students with language practices designed specifically to support effective teaming in these complex environments. To address this need, we employ discourse analysis and Speech Act Theory to identify these language practices in a case study of two cohorts of distributed, interdisciplinary, and cross-cultural student teams. The findings show correlations between language practices and successful collaboration. These correlations have significant implications for teaching and practice. © 2010 IEEE.""This paper introduces the Knowledge Base Comprehensible Text, a digital resource containing 702 studies on comprehension and usability of text and discourse, published between 1980 and 2010. The paper explains which publications were included in the knowledge base, how they were collected, how they were annotated and what the interface of the knowledge base looks like. Method: Literature search Results: The paper presents a brief survey of the studies contained in this resource, and discusses the answers of the knowledge base to an exemplary question about the comprehensibility of passives. Conclusion: The knowledge base makes research on comprehension accessible that is relevant for both practitioners and researchers in the field of technical communication. It is a useful tool in a field which, by its very nature, has a strong interdisciplinary orientation and is therefore hard to oversee.""Reports on the use of visual narrative for user-testing an interactive museum show* Demonstrates that mapping the audience's reading of the visual narratives was an effective testing structure in developing the show""In this article, I present findings from a discourse analysis of an often-overlooked genre of technical communication, regulatory writing. The study focuses on post-bellum regulations that disproportionately affected African Americans and the historical contexts in which the regulations were written. Historically, African Americans of all socioeconomic backgrounds have maintained an implicit mistrust of government regulations and the government officials who write them. The justification for this mistrust is deeply rooted in the fact that for decades regulations were not written to protect the rights of African Americans nor was their input considered in regulatory writing. In Communicating Across Cultures, Stella Ting-Toomey argues, ""if conflict parties do not trust each other, they tend to move away (cognitively, affectively and physically) from each other rather than struggle side by side in negotiation"" [1, p. 222]. This study reveals rhetorical strategies used in historical regulatory wri ing that may still impact the ethos of regulatory writers.""This article describes a study conducted among technical communication managers. As one part of a special issue reporting on the entire study, this particular article focuses on the participants’ responses to questions about education and training of technical communicators, including credentialing, skills and competencies, the gap between school and work, professional development, and the pattern of technical communication careers in terms of professional growth. Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews. Results: Participants valued basic technical writing skills and traditional credentialing (such as college degrees in TPC) over technical degrees or certifications. Yet they also advised that academic programs push students to develop strategic thinking and other professional skills and confidence. Conclusion: Practitioners will need both basic skills and strategic skills to advance in their careers. © 2015, Technical Communication.

Although it is assumed such people are hired for their writing skills, they still must be trained quickly in four areas: how business is done in the organization, the process used to produce information, the style of writing preferred, and the technical tools available and how they are to be used. This paper shows one way of setting up such a training program. It is based on an actual course developed over a period of three years. © 1990 IEEE"The author reports on social media research in technical and professional communication (TPC) training through a national survey of 30 professional and technical communication programs asking about their use of social media in technical communication.

However, its focus on a uni-directional translation from one language into another by an individual scholar, with too little consideration for the influences, expectations, and entanglements of culture, proves problematic. The present essay envisions translation as a bi-directional, dynamically negotiated process that occurs within and between communities of scholars and that transforms the language, the person of the translator, the communities involved, and the cultural expectations. This conception of translation as a dynamic process in which business communication scholars participate predicts a balance of trade between business communication and other disciplines, situates language use in place and time, and helps to articulate and develop international cultural expectations for transforming business communication and the Association for Business Communication. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication."The steady stream of new scientific and technical terms and expressions is a major source of difficulty for those whose task it is to translate technical literature from English into Chinese. the problem is the greater because of the effective division of the Chinese language territory into two separate domains: Mainland China and Taiwan.

The creative possibilities in medical and science writing are illustrated in the juxtaposition of fictioin and nonfiction writing. Four major areas of career opportunities are presented for the medical or science writer.""This article presents translation as a user-localized activity. Using Sun’s (2012) distinction between user and practitioner localization, the researchers present a preliminary illustration of how translation is enacted by multilingual participants aiming to translate words from their heritage languages into English. Method: As part of this pilot study, ten, ten-minute interviews were conducted, video-recorded, and coded to better understand how multilingual users adapt information from their heritage languages into English. Results: Results suggest that users employ several strategies when translating in context: acting, comparing/contrasting, deconstructing, gesturing, intonation, negotiating, sketching, and storytelling. These strategies involve the use of both words and other semiotic resources (for example, gestures, intonation) to convey meaning across languages. Conclusion: Technical communication researchers and practitioners could develop more effective translation and localization frameworks by learning from the userlocalized translation practices of multilinguals. Analyzing the translation practices of multilinguals who are not professional translators or interpreters could provide a framework for technical communicators to better recognize the complexities of writing in English for international audiences. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

The author starts with the discussion of translation criteria of different contemporary schools such as aesthetic equivalence, dynamic equivalence, adaptation school, and alienation school. Then, in light of the characteristics of each school's criteria, the writer points out that there is not such an issue as to which criteria are more correct or superior to other ones. Each set of criteria has its own application area. Mechanically sticking to a single set of criteria will only yield undesired effects. To justify this point of view, the author uses specific examples of international business translation to show how international business stumbled because of translator's undifferentiated adherence to the use of the same translation criteria or alienation approach throughout the translation process. © The Author(s) 2015.""In a world of interlinked economies and communication networks, the translation of pragmatic documents is prevalent, important, and increasingly costly.

Four general variables relating to business communication systems and communication technology are analyzed: channeling which involves the direction, route, and destination of information; timing which includes the time factor between message receipt and transmission; editing which considers message modification; and abstracting which concerns summarizing major points of a message. Fourteen statements that relate to information transmission and retrieval for each of these variables their corresponding needed areas of research are presented. These statements will enable business communicators to understand better the relationship between communication technology and business communication systems for future research considerations. © 1984, Sage Publications.

The purpose of this exploration is threefold: (a) to show the interactions between these three modes of rhetoric more comprehensively than they have been shown in previous case studies of scientific controversies; (b) to examine the ways in which all three modes have shaped the emerging scientific consensus and, further, through a close analysis of key experimental reports, to reveal how forensic rhetoric in the cold fusion controversy has come to occupy pride of place; and (c) to suggest how the events in this controversy support Robert Sanders's contention that rhetorical practices interact with scientific practices to allow diverse researchers to arrive at constructive agreements—not merely political ones—on both research findings and ways to resolve competing interpretations. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Some Chinese people have moved their business activities to overseas countries, in particular, to developed countries. Some of them have migrated and settled down in a host space. About the case: This study aims to examine the identity work-in particular, the construction of a hybrid identity-And the business communication of a Chinese-Australian migrant, Jack, from the perspective of Chinese researchers. Situating the case: The communication characteristics of Chinese people are reviewed, and some factors related to identity work are examined. These interrelated strands provide a foundation for analyzing Jack's business communication and identity work in a host context. Research questions: (1) As an immigrant, how has Jack managed his identities in his business communication with self and Others during his life experience of more than 20 years in Australia? (2) Has Jack achieved a hybrid identity that enables him to switch his identities as he confronts the communication challenges of business situations? (3) What forces affect Jack's everyday business communication and identity work as a Chinese-Australian migrant in Australia? Methodology: Theories are applied to analyze anecdotes relating to the business communication and identity work of the migrant chosen for this case study. The first author is positioned as a cultural insider and ethnographer, observing, experiencing, and reflecting on some episodes in Jack's everyday business communication and identity work. The second author's informed input as an outsider to the case study provides interpretation of data and adds balance and a measure of objectivity. Results: Jack's communication with self and cultural Others is presented and analyzed to examine his complicated identity work in a host business arena. His shifting hybrid identity helps him to cross the border of his host culture and obtain privileges in business competition. These stories reveal that Jack's identity is continually changed and reconstructed as he builds social and cultural capital in his new business arena. Conclusions: This study captures characteristics of the transnational and cross-cultural business communication practices of Chinese migrants from the inside looking out, and it suggests that identity work is an ongoing and complex project, and that stereotypes should be avoided in transnational and cross-cultural business communication practices. © 2017 IEEE.""With the ever-increasing complexity of technology, the terms applied to technical processes pose a problem for the technical communicator. Many terms are acronyms. Some are trade names. Some are merely jargon. A style analysis that can be of help in dealing with this communications problem is presented.""Note: This commentary reflects a phone conversation with Charles Hickman, Director of Products and Special Services, AACSB (The International Association for Management Education-formerly American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business) on 16 November 1998.

Two competencies and one skill were selected from the ""Workplace Know-How's"" identified by the 1991 U.S. Department of Labor Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS). Specifically, ads including interpersonal competencies increased for the fourth consecutive year; ads including basic communication skills increased for the second consecutive year. Ads including technology competencies decreased slightly; however, the overall trend for technology remains strong. Therefore, the workplace continues seeking the competencies and skills advocated by the SCANS authors. © 2000, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""The purpose of this empirical study is to explore expectations of industry insiders and identify how student interns are performing in relation to those expectations as defined by 11 performance areas. The results of a survey of 238 industry supervisors were collected over a 5-year period in the departments of English and communication at a private university in the Northeast. While the results suggest that student interns tend to meet their supervisors' expectations in many areas, performance categories such as initiative, writing skills, and oral communication skills require increased attention in the ways we prepare students for their internships and post-graduation employment and, perhaps, the ways we help onsite supervisors develop expectations for and evaluate our interns. © 2009 by the Association for Business Communication.""Graduate schools of business are realizing how important communication is for MBA's. Therefore, over the past five or six years, many graduate schools have either started up or expanded their management communica tion programs.

Much of the wisdom about formats, arrangement, and style that has been the staple of technical writing classes for several decades is rapidly being abandoned, as are the assumptions upon which that wisdom rests. In its place a quite different perspective is developing out of new beliefs about what technical writing is and how it is created and used. The results of studies in modern rhetoric, composition pedagogy, and empirical research are altering classroom practice in many ways. This article describes those trends of change and suggests that they are establishing a new tradition.""Reports the current state of curriculum in 80 bachelor degree programs* Answers questions about requirements, program location, degrees, internships, and portfolios* Describes two newly revised programs to suggest curricular trends""Replacing freshman English with technical writing seems logical because the freshman course stresses essays by uninformed students directed to well informed teachers, who encourage the inductive pattern and pay more attention to the writer than to the communication. Moreover, essays are rarely encountered after college. Technical writing, despite its misleading name, is applicable to all fields because it emphasizes efficiency, precision, and communicative effectiveness. The information flows from the knowledgeable to the uninformed, is normally arranged deductively, and focuses upon the reader. Intellectually and rhetorically demanding, it belongs in all professional training.""Since this article was written, Radio Shack has improved the TRS-80 in ways that make it more attractive for word processing. First, they have im proved the keyboard considerably. Keyboards on new units are entirely usable. Second, there is an official lower case modification that is installed by Radio Shack technicians, and it works well. Small Systems Software sells a version of the Electric Pencil that works with this lower case modification. Third, the cassette storage reliability has been improved so tapes are nearly always recorded suc cessfully. These improvements make the TRS-80/ Electric Pencil even more attractive. © 1980, Sage Publications.

The writer conveys information using printed letters concatenated to make words, these, in turn made into sentences. He has available similar mechanisms to supplement his written communication but rarely uses them: he can use different type faces; he can lay out the information upon the page in different fashions; he can vary the size of the printed material. Only the last, the use of different type faces to supplement communication is examined here, with examples from books which teach computer science. The salient feature of multiple type faces is that they increase intelligibility with no diminution in the information transmitted.""This paper describes a general methodology and principles for the preparation of tutorials, or computer-assisted instructional courses, to introduce first-time users to computer terminals.

Compared to the ""golden age of letters,"" so the argument goes, each subsequent generation of writers is worse than the last. Although contemporary readers and educators commiserate over encounters with bad writing, a fair comparison of 18th century American exemplars to modern American exemplars reveals a significant advance in clarity, an advance that technical communicators can be proud of. To demonstrate the advances in expository writing over the past two centuries, the author compares what the authors of the U.S. Constitution did with their limited resources to what modern professional communicators do with their abundance of resources. Many of the communication problems that were pervasive when the U.S. Constitution was created have since been remedied by insights emerging from the fields of linguistics, human factors, and cognitive psychology, among others.""Expansion of typewriter composition and the shift from letter-press to sheet-fed offset and web-offset printing are two major developments that are lowering costs and improving the efficiency of the overall publishing operation at the American Institute of Physics (AIP). In 1972, out of a total of 104,000 text pages published by AIP and its member societies, about 69,000 pages, or 66 percent, were typewriter composed. About 11,000 pages for Physical Review C and Physical Review D are typewriter composed at AIP's new publishing facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Another 8000 pages mainly for Applied Physics Letters and the Journal of Applied Physics are produced by the Publications Division Composition Section in New York City. A small fraction of the total is composed to AIP specifications by the authors themselves. Outside contractors handle the remaining typewriter composition including all of the Russian translation journals. The main justification for the switch from monotype to typewriter composition is the resulting savings of 20 to 30 percent in composition cost. Depending upon the journal and the compositor used, these savings amount to as much as 10 per page. In addition, the close coupling of copy editing, composition, proofreading and page makeup that is possible with an in-house typewriter composition operation has shortened publication time by as much as 2 weeks out of a total of 3 months. The AIP typewriter composition system is described from copy editing, through the composition of galleys, to page makeup and the production of final camera-ready copy for offset printing. specially modified IBM Executive proportional-spacing electric typewriters, equipped with unique attachments, permit the use of a wide range of special characters and signs (italic, Greek, mathematical symbols, superscripts, etc. ) needed to compose scientific articles.""Finds that x-height, line length, and line spacing in brochures, scientific journals, and novels do not reflect typographic guidelines  Demonstrates that the boundaries for these typographic dimensions differ by genre.""Structured abstracts contain more information, are of higher quality, and are easier to search and read than are traditional abstracts. However, there is a bewildering variety of ways in which structured abstracts can be printed and little is known about how the typography of structured abstracts can affect their clarity.

To apply the new technology, professional communicators need to understand the principles underpinning typographical design and their origin in the functionalist aesthetics of modernism, particularly as articulated by the Bauhaus. While some of the key concepts of modernism—strict economy, universal objectivity, intuitive perception, and the unity ofform and purpose—are well-suited to business and technical documents, these concepts are bound to an historical and intellectual milieu. By understanding the influence of modernism on typographical design, professional communicators equipped with the new technology can adapt design principles to the rhetorical context of specific documents. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Uncertainty is defined herein as the perceived lack of information, knowledge, beliefs, and feelings necessary for accomplishing organizational tasks. The goal of communicators is to reduce andlor manage their own and their audience's uncertainties through language. By analyzing corporate, departmental, and individual uncertainties, writers can interpret communication problems, design documents, and manage formal and informal communication systems efficiently and effectively. © 1986, Sage Publications.

In Sweden as well as in other European countries, understandability of financial reports is a qualitative characteristic that is increasingly focused on. This is partly due to the growing significance of the stock market as a source for venture capital. Test techniques from linguistics and pedagogy have been used in accounting research to investigate the understandability of financial reports. The cloze technique is used in this study to investigate the understandability of messages in two Swedish annual reports related to small investors, and sophisticated preparers and users such as auditors and financial managers. The results show that important parts of the reports were not understood by small investors. The conclusion is that if small investors are continuingly to be considered as a target group for these financial reports, then there must be a large improvement of the text material. Otherwise the financial reports must be left to sophisticated users and interpreters.""Technology mediated learning (TML) is gaining interest from both academic researchers and communication professionals as training with internet technology and web-based distance learning become increasingly popular. This paper investigates social norms, individual-level cultural orientation (collectivism), and affective commitment (internalization and identification) and studies their influences on the system users' (or learners') attitude toward sharing knowledge by email in the TML environment. An empirical test of the proposed model was conducted in the pilot test (n=15) and the main test (n=411).

Specifically, they highlight the primacy of logics and identities in the social construction of PR by exploring how a wide range of actors interpret and understand PR in Chinese cultural contexts. In conducting 40 semistructured interviews with PR agency consultants, in-house PR practitioners, media journalists, and industry association officers, the authors have found multiple and competing logics within the field that, in turn, confer reconciled identities on Chinese PR. The Chinese cultural contexts serve as a repertoire for stakeholders to draw institutional logics and legitimize their interpretations of PR practice in China. © The Author(s) 2013.""Few concepts in the social sciences have wielded more discriminatory power over the status of knowledge claims than that of statistical significance. Currently operationalized as a = 0.05, statistical significance frequently separates publishable from nonpublishable research, renewable from nonrenewable grants, and, in the eyes of many, experimental success from failure. If literacy is envisioned as a sort of competence in a set of social and intellectual practices, then scientific literacy must encompass the realization that this cardinal arbiter of social scientific knowledge was not born out of an immanent logic of mathematics but socially constructed and reconstructed in response to sociohistoric conditions.""This paper presents an overview of the ways in which self-esteem operates in employee communication. As they develop effective communication skills, managers need to consider the consequence of stress on employee self-esteem and performance.

This paper discusses the relationship among self-esteem, occupational stress, and communication quality then recommends ways In which self-esteem can be enhanced through employee communication. © 1994 IEEE.""Legislative requirements like those in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have sharply increased the incidence of monitoring of electronic communications, but the consequences of this trend are little understood. This study examines the impact of organizational monitoring of sensitive instant message (IM) discussions with a designed experiment. When their IMs are known to be monitored, individuals are found to sharply curtail their discussion of personally incriminating information and to increase their spontaneous denials of knowledge of sensitive topics. Surprisingly, perhaps, they also increase their discussion of relayed information that may incriminate others or the organization. Qualitative analysis suggests that people are not aware they make these adjustments to their IM communication content when monitored. Given the legislative compliance motivations for some of the monitoring activity in companies, it is ironic that study findings suggest organizations may communicate less firsthand information about potentially curtailable legal liabilities and other sensitive incidents requiring corrective action when communication is monitored. Organizations enacting monitoring of IM should pay heed to the requirements as well as the discretion available to them within those requirements to enact monitoring in a way that suits their organizational goals. © 2008 IEEE.""U.S. and Mexican managerial attitudes concerning the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) process on the United States are explored.

Other benefits of ITV networks are listed. The planning and implementation of an ITV network are discussed."This study investigated how Canadian university student interns in three disciplines perceived their educational preparation for workplace writing. The students' perceptions differed markedly according to disciplinary background, with Management students responding very positively about their preparation, Political Science students responding positively, and Communications Studies students responding negatively. The authors discuss how these responses potentially reflect differing student expectations; theorypractice linkages; and patterns of integrating instruction and practice in research, analysis, and workplace genres across these disciplines. The results suggest that universities can prepare students for workplace writing by providing them with instruction and practice in common workplace genres, relevant research and analytic skills, experience in collaborative writing, ample feedback on their writing, and an appreciation for the socially situated nature of genres and genre acquisition. The authors also point to the benefits of work placement and internship programs and suggest directions for further research. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Despite the legal and social ramifications of presentence investigation reports, little is known about them outside the legal community. The author uses the frameworks of genre theory and activity systems to analyze the documents, the criminal justice system's ideology of sentencing, and the statutes and regulations that govern the reports. What emerges is an ambiguous and contradictory genre at odds with the philosophy of individualized justice underpinning its origins, a genre that has eschewed narrative for the sake of objectivity. The article further underscores the value of employing a flexible theoretical framework when studying workplace genres. © The Author(s) 2012.""Experienced practitioners in the technical writing business are inclined to believe that they know a good piece of writing when they see one.

The article focuses on teachers who want to integrate critical perspectives about business communication into their classes. A course ethos, learning groups, and an introductory activity were used to develop students' thinking about business and management communication. These strategies encouraged collaborative peer learning in a large bicultural/multicultural lecture environment and developed learning relationships typically found in a small class context. In addition, the activities produced ongoing lecture learning groups in which business students could question their 'trained incapacities,' boundaries, and assumptions gained from their experiences of communicating and managing relationships during these activities. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication."Technical translators must know more than one or two foreign languages: they must be competent in one or more technical subjects as well.

It uses as a case study Hong Kong’s strict new food-labeling law that requires distributers and retailers to remove certain nutritional claims from packages of imported food before they sell them. This practice of redacting unlawful text on packages requires that distributers and retailers engage in complex processes of discursive reasoning, and it sometimes results in packages that are difficult for customers to interpret. The case study highlights important issues in the regulation of commercial texts concerning collaboration, intertextuality, and the conflicts that can arise when the principals, authors, and animators of such texts have different agendas. © The Author(s) 2014.""The best practices presented in textbooks and professional publications provide separate guidelines for paper-based and electronic or ""scannable"" résumés.

This paper also examines major issues in the evaluation and design of usability. The sampling of realistic tasks and target readers is often very difficult, particularly in a laboratory setting. Additional emphasis must be placed on using multiple observation periods, standardized measures and materials, and multimethod assessments of usability. © 1989 IEEE""Although usability testing and research have become critical tasks for technical communicators in the workplace, little discussion in technical communication focuses on teaching usability in technical communication programs. This article asserts that technical communication programs are particularly well positioned to adopt usability testing and research in their curricula because of inherent connections between usability and technical communication, such as their mutual emphases on audience analysis, technology, and information design. Approaches to implementation of usability courses at three universities are described, and the authors share suggestions for adopting usability in the areas of curriculum, equipment, and facilities needed for conducting usability."This study compares two versions of a manual for the Intel SatisFAXtion faxmodem: the original manual shipped with the product and a proposed shortened manual.

User reviews can provide a new perspective for rewriting a document. This article discusses how to obtain user reviews by conducting usability tests and controlled research. Usability testing is very simple: you just find users who know nothing about a product and have them use it with the manual. By watching where they have problems using the product or where they need help, you can identify problems in the manual (and sometimes in the product).""Examines four usability issues that emerge from XML development* Contends that usability will need to be evaluated in terms of the interrelationships among different interfaces and content views""Although computer-based presentations are nowadays an expected standard, empirical research on them is still surprisingly rare: Little knowledge exists about general attitudes toward presentation software or users' functional demands other than editing texts and images. Therefore, we focus in our explorative study on users' handling and evaluation of such software, including a comparison between educational and business users. Method: A total of 1014 participants (51% female, 49% male) took part in a web-based study. Among them were 444 students and 570 employees from different fields. The online questionnaire consisted of 67 questions in three parts and was based on the current literature and ratings of five experts. Results: Our results show a strong preference for using Microsoft PowerPoint, which led to rather satisfied users. Computer-based presentations are mainly used in educational settings, talks, and meetings. Differences between students and employees were identified, with the latter showing a broader use. Furthermore, independent of occupation, participants stressed the importance of usability aspects such as ease of use, compatibility, or loading speed; however, they equally desired more creativity in computer-based presentations and better speakers. Conclusions: The process of slide generation seems to be patchwork, and a large amount of time is spent on design and animation; thus we recommend measures to reduce the time spent on matters of visual style. In addition, current presentation software still suffers from several usability issues. Generally, the central function of the speaker and the supporting role of the presentation software are to be stressed.""Quotation marks and italics - two devices for giving special typographic treatment to words - are customarily used when a writer is introducing unfamiliar terms. The purpose of this as-yet-unexplained convention is to prevent the reader from experiencing a moment of apprehension in sentences in which an unfamiliar term appears several words or more before its explanation. The quotation marks or italics signal the reader that the writer knows the term is probably unfamiliar and that the term will therefore be explained. In those few instances in which unfamiliar terms are not explained, the reader infers that an explanation is not necessary for a productive reading of the text. This convention is less functional when the unfamiliar term is followed immediately by its explanation and is nonfunctional when the explanation precedes the term.""The technique of repetition violates what most writers have learned about good writing (and good manners). It is, however, a prominent and effective rhetorical feature of technical communication. In the way it is used in technical writing, repetition establishes that technical authors are ″reader friendly.″""Technical communicators are often confronted with the problem of style when they encounter trademarks in the documents they process.

Specifically, I analyze how women bicyclists of the 1890s authored instructional materials to complicate gendered and classed assumptions about users implicit in manufacturer-produced texts. I argue that technical communicators, in their teaching and research, should consider the role that extraorganizational technical communication plays in generating vital and lasting cultural changes. © 2012 Copyright Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""Little information is known on user attitudes toward corporate style guides (CSGs). A national survey shows that an overwhelming 93% of users and 85% of non-users advocate CSG usage primarily to generate consistency in documents, to save time generating documents, and to create a professional look in documents. As corporations face the future by restructuring, usually by downsizing, and by competing more in a global economy, CSG usage will be more prevalent in corporate America, as the results of this survey indicate that CSGs are an economical quality tool that benefits both the user and the corporation.""This article examines research literature on educational hypermedia design and divides the literature into two groups, one advocating no author control of the user's path through the material, the other advocating varying degrees of control.

Instructions that optimally fit the needs of this elderly audience could enhance the usability of the products they belong to. The study described in this article is aimed at an investigation of this gerontological research literature to find out what is already known about age deficiencies in cognitive processes which might adversely influence instructional text processing. On the basis of the findings from this research, tentative guidelines could be given on how such manuals could be designed and written. Moreover, we propose several kinds of follow-up research that still have to be carried out to gather more knowledge on the topic of manuals for the elderly.""The failure of a delivered Information System (IS) to match users’ expectations of it is a frequent cause of project failure. This paper examines some of the causes of expectation failure, in particular the development of inappropriate mental models of a new IS by users. The documents traditionally used to express the requirements for a new IS are seldom fully understood by users, and often prove hard to verify. Documents written for, with, and sometimes by the users—the user manuals—have proved more successful in these respects. A companion paper [1] discusses the practicality of using user manuals to help understand and shape users’ mental models at an early project phase, and thus reduce the probability of expectation failure. It includes a review of the (scant) literature, describes the different roles that user manuals can play throughout a project, and provides advice for professional communicators, project managers, and other project personnel. © 1994 IEEE.""In a companion paper [1], I argued that the mismatch of a delivered Information System (IS) to the users’ expectations of it is a frequent cause of project failure. These expectations are held in a conceptual structure, referred to by some authors as a mental model. Helping users develop appropriate mental models of the new IS in an early project phase is an important element in managing expectations, but the documents traditionally used to express and check users’ requirements often fail in this regard. Over the last two decades a few authors have found that user manuals written early in the project can be very effective as a means of communication between developers and users. This paper reviews the literature and describes the different roles that user manuals can play throughout a project. It provides practical advice for professional communicators, project managers, and other project personnel. © 1994 IEEE.""Tutorials and user manuals are important forms of impersonal support for using software applications, including electronic medical records (EMRs). Differences between user-and vendor-generated documentation may indicate support needs, which are not sufficiently addressed by the official documentation, and reveal new elements that may inform the design of tutorials and user manuals. Research question: What are the differences between user-generated tutorials and manuals for an EMR and the official user manual from the software vendor? Literature review: Effective design of tutorials and user manuals requires careful packaging of information, balance between declarative and procedural texts, an action and task-oriented approach, support for error recognition and recovery, and effective use of visual elements. No previous research compared these elements between formal and informal documents. Methodology: We conducted a mixed-methods study. Seven tutorials and two manuals for an EMR were collected from three family health teams and compared with the official user manual from the software vendor. Documents were qualitatively analyzed using a framework analysis approach in relation to the principles of technical documentation described before. Subsets of the data were quantitatively analyzed using cross-tabulation to compare the types of error information and visual cues in screen captures between user-and vendor-generated manuals. Results and discussion: The user-developed tutorials and manuals differed from the vendor-developed manual in that they contained mostly procedural and not declarative information; were customized to the specific workflow, user roles, and patient characteristics; contained more error information related to work processes than software usage; and used explicit visual cues on screen captures to help users identify window elements. These findings imply that to support EMR implementation, tutorials and manuals need to be customized and adapted to specific organizational contexts and workflows. The main limitation of the study is its generalizability. Future research should address this limitation and may explore alternative approaches to software documentation, such as modular manuals or participatory design. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Twenty years after the publication of Patricia Sullivan's ""Beyond a narrow conception of usability testing""in the IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, three scholars-all Sullivan's students-reflect on the history and development of usability testing and research. Following Sullivan, this article argues that usability bridges the divide between science and rhetoric and asserts that usability is most effective when it respects the knowledge-making practices of a variety of disciplines. By interrogating trends in usability method, the authors argue for a definition of usability that relies on multiple epistemologies to triangulate knowledge-making. The article opens with a brief history of the development of usability methods and argues that usability requires a balance between empirical observation and rhetoric. Usability interprets human action and is enriched by articulating context and accepting contingency. Usability relies on effective collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders in the design of technology. Ultimately, professional and technical communication scholars are best prepared to coin new knowledge with a long and wide view of usability. © 2007 IEEE.""To produce more effective user manuals, writers can be guided by the results of user polls. The information collected can come from response forms in the back of each manual, from surveys among selected user groups, and from personal communication with members of user groups. Such polls typically point out that most users want (1) manuals with fewer words, (2) instructions that are task-oriented, not software-descriptive, and (3) more explanation on how to use a software product. The apparent contradiction between the first and third findings implies that different classes of users require different information. By reorganizing both the content and the format of a manual a writer can come closer to satisfying the needs of different users. Each manual should contain a learning section and a retrieval section; chapters should be self-contained and exercises should abound.""This article describes a holistic, discourse-based method for assessing the critical thinking skills of undergraduate senior-level finance majors. Rejecting a psychometric assessment approach in which component features of critical thinking are disaggregated, this study is based on a holistic scoring of student memos. Students were asked to recommend and justify a course of action to a lay client facing an ill-structured finance problem. Analysis of student memos reveals critical thinking weaknesses that may be ameliorated by changes in assignments or instructional methods. The memos reveal four kinds of critical thinking problems: (a) failure to address the client's problem, (b) random rather than purposeful application of finance tools and methodologies, (c) inability to translate finance concepts or methods into lay language, and (d) inability to construct rhetorically useful graphics. The curricular implications of this study are discussed. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""As an organization’s in-house computer system be- comes more complicated, user manuals can quickly become so large and complicated that they become unusable. Redesigning a computer user manual to be both comprehensive and usable can be a question of finding what information to keep and what to cut. To produce a more efficient and portable computer user manual, a structured, three-stage design analysis was added to the pre-writing strategy. To find what information users really needed, a needs assessment was used as part of the three-stage procedure. the portable manual was designed for a large government organization whose employees are in a highly mobile environment. © 1992 IEEE.""During the aftermath of recent disasters (both natural and human made), people have communicated by cobbling together available social software resources-relying on the capabilities of Internet tools such as blogs, news sites, and Flickr. Examining the use of social software taking place after the London bombings of July 7, 2005, I propose a method by which we can study users' literate appropriations to shape the development of more accommodating communication systems.""This article discusses accessibility barriers as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and provides a basic primer on how technical communicators can remove these barriers during their Web design process and test to ensure the barriers were removed. The article focuses on 10 common barriers to a meaningful experience for people with disabilities, barriers that a technical communicator can consider when designing online information. Working on accessibility issues before online information goes live will help to reduce re-work and re-design and can save a lot of headaches for a technical communicator.""Technical writers and translators struggle with language consistency in emerging technologies. Corpus linguistics can track language structures in such quickly developing environments. An ad-hoc corpus may be the tool needed for technical communicators. Key concepts: Mega-corpora versus ad-hoc corpora: The term 'mega-corpora' typically covers the existing national corpora, whereas ad-hoc corpora can be created quickly for technical communication. Variation versus consistency: variation covers the range of possible solutions compared to the need for consistency of terminology in given contexts. Representativeness versus adequacy: representativeness defines the possibility of variation within the scope of the field; in contrast , adequacy represents contextual suitability. Key lessons: To use ad-hoc corpora as a tool for keeping track of and understanding language variation in texts about emerging technology: (1) design and compile a small set of relevant descriptions regarding the emerging technology, (2) use the software corpus tool representation of corpora to evaluate whether the ad-hoc corpus is representative - meaning that adding new texts does not add new words or variations in terminology use, (3) use the software corpus tool AntConc to analyze the ad-hoc corpus finding concordance patterns and variation in terminology usage, and (4) use linguistic strategies for selecting terminology based on linguistic evidence rather than intuition. Implications for practice: The ad-hoc corpus method offers an evidence-based approach for determining patterns of terminology. This method can be applied to standardizing product documentation or tracking variations in language use and can help technical writers and translators keep track of evolving terminology for emerging technologies. © 1988-2012 IEEE.""Technical communication is a translation process translating 'computerese' or 'engineerese' into the language of the user. This paper describes how the translation process was simplified for a particular project and explains why this process made it easier to produce usable documentation. The workbook process described here was used to document the first release of the Distributed Processing Programming Executive (DPPX), an IBM program product. The basic idea of the workbook concept was to have everyone who was assigned to the project (designers, developers, and writers) use the same information source. This concept was carried out by consolidating all the information in a single online data base ('the workbook') that was used by everyone from the beginning of the project to the end. We put the product's documentation online in an attempt to eliminate the problems of hard-copy distribution among reviewers and the use of outdated material by project developers.""In this article, we use extant International Business Machines' internal communications to demonstrate how Boje's notion of ""antenarrative"" can serve as a methodology for feminist historiography and as a way of uncovering forgotten and unchallenged systems of power and legitimacy in technical and professional communication. The antenarrative fragments of any official, sanctioned story give us insight into the ways in which power has been distributed throughout an organization and where agency can be claimed in real time. We also see that a methodology that considers the untold and unofficial stories of women in the workplace works to explain current distributions of power. This can be done by investigating the antenarratives that threaten to disrupt the prepackaged grand narrative of organizations; we show this specifically through a case study of International Business Machines' archival memos in contrast with the company's website and public relations documents. © The Author(s) 2016."Measurement of the effectiveness of a writing course is considered especially important to those who hire consultants to teach their employees. The author presents a method of evaluating participants' skill improvement by means of measuring their attitudes toward writing tasks before and after taking a consultant-taught course. Sample results of such pre-test and post-test analyses are given."According to the management literature, a business model explains how an organization makes money (generates revenue). These models not only affect revenue but, because generating revenue is central to the survival of an organization, affects all other operations. Method: Applies the theory of business models from the management literature to technical communication groups, using descriptions of technical communication groups from empirical studies to identify the most common business models for these groups and suggests how the source of revenue affects operations. Results: Technical communication groups typically fall into one of these models: (a) Venture Capital Model-groups that produce content published for sale; (b) Design Model-groups that design the architecture and oversee implementation of Web sites, large information campaigns, user interfaces, and designed-in information; (c) Agency Model-groups that produce marketing communication, employee communication, and other high profile content; (d) Development Shop Model-groups that support a strategic effort by developing help, user's guides, reference manuals, and similar product information; (e) Technical Support Model-groups that produce materials for internal users; and (f) Contractor Model-groups that update documentation for products and services have long life cycles (often lasting for decades). Although the literature on technical communication advocates for the Design model, most technical communication groups operate under the Development Shop, Technical Support, and Contracting Models, as well as mixed models. Conclusions: This theory does not prescribe actions technical communication groups should take to change their status; rather it describes why technical communication groups in different organizations might have different experiences.""Change management, reengineering, repositioning, restructuring, or just doing things differently-the scope of change ranges from monumental cultural shifts of billion-dollar corporations to a local retailer's efforts to remain competitive in a town under siege by national mega-chains. Implementing change successfully, regardless of the scale, requires internal communication strategies that are interactive, dynamic, and even fun. Such strategies should train workers in the useof contemporary tools, while simultaneously entertaining them and providing positive re-enforcement through continuous recognition and reward. But above all, change management communication must be closely linked to business performance, pairing the needs of employees with the needs of the business. Doing so will result in greater employee support and ultimately lead to increased performance.""Business students must possess the abilities of discovery, problem solving, and collaboration in international and cross-cultural business communication and management when entering a competitive, knowledge-based global econ omy.

To use audits, teachers need to gain access to organizations, especially through internal audit departments; negotiate the exchange of essentially free audit findings for a learning experience and research data; and secure commitment from top management, other organizational members, and student auditors. To administer the audit itself, teachers should start with a pilot audit followed by full assessment, conduct a two-phase process of data collection and analysis that includes questionnaires and interviews, and report findings in a timely and effective manner. The promises of the approach outweigh its inevitable perils."This study examines how members of a global virtual team chose communication media while managing multiple boundaries. The study is unique in that it considers the perspectives of U.S. managers who teleworked from domestic workplaces and virtual team members located in offices in India. It describes the complex dynamics of the decision-making processes that team members used in attempting to allocate their individual resources in order to meet the demands of a high-performance organizational culture. The findings suggest that managers chose media that met task requirements and maintained the boundaries between their work and personal lives rather than media that would provide the most satisfactory experience. © The Author(s) 2013."Successful rightsizing requires that managers preserve the morale and productivity of the remaining employees. A communication consultant can offer invaluable guidance on how to 1) maintain employees morale, 2) help employees perceive the layoffs as fair, 3) take care of employees who have lost their jobs, 4) assist management with layoff decisions, 5) help remaining employees cope with change, and 6) maintain effective communication with workers. On these sensitive topics, management will benefit from advice which is external, expert, and soundly based.""Regulatory reforms in the United States, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and Regulation Fair Disclosure, emphasize the significance of timely and transparent corporate reporting. Analysis of corporate financial disclosures using communication theory can provide useful information to stakeholders. Communication is a goal-directed activity that involves a purpose, and one of the central goals of communication for the corporation is to maintain a positive image. Benoit's theory of image restoration says that management presents the messages (responses) that are instrumental in obtaining the firm's goals. This article's objectives are to summarize Benoit's image restoration typology and to propose its potential use in analyzing management's communication strategies in financial reporting. The authors provide examples from corporate U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and annual reports of computer companies to illustrate the use of various communication strategies based on Benoit's typology. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""Effective use of graphics and skills in analyzing information are two topics that need to be covered in depth in the basic technical writing course. Many kinds of computer printouts can be understood by students from various disciplines. From these printouts, problems, like the ones described here, can be developed to teach graphics skills and analysis concomitantly. Using computer printouts to teach these two important topics has four specific advantages: 1. students become familiar with reading and interpreting computer printouts and learn to separate essential from nonessential data in defining a problem; 2. they learn to write analytic or information reports using computer data only; 3. they gain practice in determining what kind of graphic is best for a specific kind of information; and 4. they gain practice in correlating verbal discussion with visual presentation.""Writing, especially when accompanied by feedback and revision, is a powerful enhancer for learning, as the writing-to-learn literature attests. Yet, writing as a vehicle for learning seldom appears in engineering content courses. We relate our experiences with a pilot program in engineering design funded through the National Science Foundation. Specifically, we focus on using Calibrated Peer Review as a platform for formative and summative assessment of integrated writing assignments in targeted courses. Our results how that students improved their skills in elements of engineering design and in writing. Additionally, assessment of the learning outcomes from the targeted courses were used successfully to document Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology's criterion EC3 (g), ""ability to communicate effectively,"" in our latest accreditation cycle. © 2008 IEEE.""There is more to successful communication than learning the styles and proce dures often found in the traditional business communication syllabus.

I explain how communication consult ing projects can be used to examine the context of organizational communica tion. Finally, I discuss the implications for teaching business and technical communication using a real-world, critical approach.""In the workplace setting professionals use language to create boundaries of exclusion and inclusion, using the discourses of their professions and of specific workplace domain. Some boundaries are marked by formal testsdirected memos, posted notices, stamps that read ""For Your Eyes Only."" Less overt forms, and arguably more effective, are specific rhetorical devices relying on knowledge of the corporate and professional culture. People are included or excluded from such cultures by their knowledge and ability to manipulate professional fables and folklore, historical data, workplace experience narratives, and practical knowledge. These discourse practices can be used to promote solidarity and positively strengthen professional cultures, but they can also be used to obstruct communication and to create social fragmentation in the workplace. This article examines some examples of discourse practices among managers and employees in the customer service department of a large manufacturing firm, and shows how knowledge of the ways that language can both include and exclude people from cultural groups in the worksite can help professional communicators facilitate more effective and responsible communication practices in workplace settings. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Assessment continues to be an important issue for technical communicators in both practitioner and academic contexts. In this article, we investigate methods of program assessment used by corporate learning sites and we profile value add methods as a new way to both construct and evaluate academic programs in technical communication. Our goal is to introduce value added assessment methods as one way to supplement and expand current methods of program assessment. The article initially reviews Return on Investment (ROI) indicators as a widely used model for assessing programs. However, we are critical of these indicators, suggesting that they are biased against technical communication in both practitioner and academic contexts. The article then examines and critiques assessment methods from corporate training environments. These include methods employed by corporate universities and value added process-based assessment methods. The second half of the article profiles value added methods by applying them in a brief assessment of a technical communications certificate program. We conclude that while the program uses ROI indicators as a marketing device, the value the program brings and adds to its university is the ""portal"" it creates for university and business community collaboration. This value cannot be fully demonstrated solely through the use of ROI indicators. The article then discusses the kinds of programmatic negotiations value added processes require within university contexts that may impose non-value added activities on departments and programs. The article concludes by critically examining the appropriateness of corporate assessment methods for academic contexts.""This case study describes classroom use of the decision making criteria contained in a recommendation report for corrective action following the 1999 bonfire accident at Texas A&M University (TAMU), in which 12 students were killed and 27 were injured during a school-sanctioned activity. The instructional framework introduces criteria as a decision making tool, asks undergraduates to apply simple criteria in a hypothetical situation, outlines the TAMU case, and analyzes the TAMU report's criteria item by item. It also provides guidelines for assessing students' integration of criteria into their own recommendation reports. This case study offers an analytical model not often available to readers outside an organization and introduces undergraduates to a more sophisticated evaluative methodology than most have used in previous writing projects. © 2004 IEEE.""The authors pursue three aims in this article.

A comparison of the writing of two students—a competent writer and a weak one—before and after the design discussion indicates that a basic understanding of design principles helped them improve document macrostructure. They saw the need to involve the audience, to provide an introduction and a forecast, and to organize and highlight information using headings. The design discussion, however, appears to have had little effect on document microstructure. Although more research needs to be conducted to better understand the relationship between verbal and visual rhetoric in technical communication, integrating document design principles early appears to be a promising pedagogical technique. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

In 2000, the researchers conducted a series of three cross-sectional studies within General Electric's (GE) Global Research Center. The Center is located in Niskayuna, NY. An equivalent version of a communication survey was administered electronically to a random stratified sample of GE employees three times that year. Each employee sample was subject to a different survey intervention: no intervention, follow-up reminder email only, and leader pre-announcement email plus a follow-up reminder. The researchers also recorded how long it took respondents to return their surveys. The highest response rate (41%) occurred in the third intervention. Across the three administrations, 465 GE employees completed the surveys; 98% of respondents returned their surveys electronically rather than printing out their responses and sending them to the researcher by postal mail. The article concludes with implications and suggestions for those who administer electronic surveys within organizations. © 2007 IEEE.""Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) provide college students with hands-on experience working with genuine technical documents from the working world, an overview of the writing process, and the strategies and tasks encountered in technical writing.

This difficulty can be alleviated through genre theory strategies and research, which writing center consultants, for example, can use to focus on the specific form and content of engineering writing, which then can be taught to students in a writing center environment. Genre theory provides a means 1) for humanities writing center consultants to learn specific characteristics about engineering writing, 2) for interdisciplinary collaboration between writing professionals and engineers to take place, and 3) for students to have increased opportunities to learn the discourse of their field. All of these benefits are enhanced by discipline-specific writing programs that support and facilitate them. In addition, the collaboration provides a stimulating, fluid, creative environment in which to discuss engineering writing, an environment which reflects the changing needs of engineering education as a result of technological advancements. As technology continues to influence engineering education, prompting evolutions in both technical and communication skills and knowledge, genre theory and interdisciplinary collaboration will continue to gain importance as strategies for initiating students into the communication demands of their field. The discussion below focuses on the integration of genre theory with writing instruction in the ECE Department at the University of South Carolina. This integration stimulated interaction among ECE faculty, composition and rhetoric faculty and students, and ECE students.""Gestalt psychology principles of figure-ground segregation, symmetry, closure, proximity, good continuation, and similarity provide a simple yet powerful analytic vocabulary for discussing page layout and graphics.

Readers often lose the ability to mentally animate a mechanical process that has spatial interconnections. Technical illustrators can help readers with mental animation by providing the required graphic frames for every major subtask and situating the illustration in the suitable perspective with respect to the reader and the task. Illustrators should consider applying both external and internal graphic cueing techniques selectively and judiciously. This paper argues that illustrators need to consider multiple graphic variables before optimizing on the set of design guidelines that help readers maintain spatial connectivity in the work environment."As an educational medium, interactive television (ITV) is shaped by perceptions that all participants bring into the ITV classroom. Many articles, handbooks, and other support material already deal with standard operating advice for leading courses using ITV; here, the authors focus on the physical and mental spaces produced by ITV and explore the expectations created by the presence of such technological artifacts as television screens, microphones, and lighting banks. They explain the roles that teachers and students may assume in the ITV classroom and discuss how lack of familiarity with the technology's purpose and potential tends to reify those roles and the interactions they proscribe. Finally, they offer suggestions for responding to these issues by concentrating on students' crucial first impressions with the technology - impressions that instructors can help negotiate so they and their students can engage in pedagogically sound, educationally rich interactions in the ITV classroom.""This paper argues for using specialized collaborative writing (CW) tools to improve the results of distributed, internet-based writing teams. The key features of collaborative tools that support enhanced coordination and group awareness are compared to existing writing tools. The first internet-based CW tool, Collaboratus, is introduced, and its group features are compared with those of Microsoft Word. Next, theoretical propositions, hypotheses, and constructs are formulated to predict outcomes of distributed groups that use CW tools. A four-week-long synchronous-distributed experiment then compares the outcomes of Collaboratus and Word groups. Innovative measures show that Collaboratus groups generally experience better outcomes than Word groups, in terms of productivity, document quality, relationships, and communication, but not in terms of satisfaction. The results buttress the conclusion that internet-based CW teams can benefit from specialized collaborative technologies that provide enhanced coordination, group awareness, and CW activity support.""Building on work by Dubinsky, Haskins, and Simmons and Grabill, this article explains how a technical communication instructor used Isocrates and informal usability testing to help guide a service-learning project involving the One Laptop Per Child XO-1 notebook. For the project, engineering students received feedback from peers and elementary school teachers to determine the feasibility of using the XO-1 with at-risk children aged 6 to 9. Despite initial positive impressions, the service-learning students discovered that the XO-1 was not suitable in this situation.

Guided by an instructor, 42 students wrote daily observations of their listening behaviors for 10 weeks. These observations were arranged into 10 prescribed general listening categories. Using content analysis procedures, two trained decoders identified content themes that were observed by more than half the students in 7 of the 10 general categories. The results demonstrated that the journal, combined with content analysis procedures, can be used successfully to identify students' listening behavior problems so that a targeted training regimen can be designed to address these deficiencies. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Students are simultaneously registered in all the courses constituting the learning community. The learning community approach to writing instruction can be viewed as one way to implement writing across the curriculum with the following distinguishing features. First, students are registered simultaneously for both courses; the communication skills taught in one course are simultaneously reinforced in another course. Second, the faculty of the two courses interact extensively to deliver skills (e.g., communication skills) in a coherent manner across the two courses. In this paper we describe the development of a theoretical framework for connecting the two courses. This theoretical framework guided implementation decisions such as the choice of communication skills to be covered in the accounting course, the design of assignments, and the design of evaluation criteria. While we focus on the integration of an accounting course with a communication course, the learning community approach and the implementation steps are applicable to other disciplines. © 1996 IEEE.""Measures and analyzes effects and interactions in environments that match and mismatch the individual's learning orientation  Analyzes whether learning orientation, time, and environment account for different effects and interactions.""An overview is given on some issues concerning DTP systems.

Although ethics is generally recognized as a crucial area of study, there is little agreement about how it should be included or taught. Moreover, these disagreements often reflect deeply different perspectives on basic pedagogy, the role of business schools, and the links between business and other disciplines. The author argues that literature provides a useful means of restructuring course work to provide ethics instruction and to forge needed links between business and the humanities. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Researchers sometimes depend on large sample sizes to produce variation measurable as statistically significant. Magnitude estimation scaling, a method tracing its origin to the field of psychophysics, has had some interesting results in social science research. This article critically analyzes the technique for its potential use in business communication research. The result finds that the 12-15 percent increase in explained variance by magnitude estimation over categorical scaling methods may be useful in theory building, but may not be sufficient to justify the added expense necessary to ensure data integrity for applied business communication research. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Because microformats consist of minor additions to the HTML backbone of common webpages, they represent a simple but significant move toward what Tim Berners-Lee has called the ""Semantic Web""-but without requiring the technical and practical shifts and time demands of a complete XML-based semantic-web-development approach. Microformats also provide technical communicators with literacies and a conceptual foundation to approach more advanced Semantic Web technologies and suggest ways to refine current web design practice. © 2009 IEEE.""Previous research suggests that there are advantages to writing in groups or in pairs compared with writing individually, and that men write differently from women. However, as far as we know, no one has yet used new technology to assess published academic articles written in these different modes. Method: We assembled 80 papers from recent issues of the Journal of Educational Psychology as follows: 21 authored by individual men, 21 by individual women, 19 by pairs of men, and 19 by pairs of women. We then used two computer-based measures to assess various textual features of the Abstracts, the Introductions, and the Discussion sections of these 80 papers. Results: Several differences were found between these various parts of the journal articles (e.g., the Discussions were more readable than the Introductions and these in turn were more readable than the Abstracts). However, there were few differences between the writing of pairs or individuals, or between that of men and women. Conclusions: There was no real evidence to support the notion that writing in pairs would lead to better quality articles or that there would be differences between the readability of papers produced by men and women. Such differences may occur, however, before peer review.""Recent updates in qualitative data-analysis software have provided the qualitative researcher in professional communication with powerful tools to assist in the research process. In this tutorial, we provide a brief overview of what software choices are available and discuss features of NVivo, one prominent choice. We then use our experiences with the software to discuss how it enhances three specific dimensions of our research: efficiency, multiplicity, and transparency. We end with a compilation of best practices for using the software. © 2010 IEEE.""Business, like many other fields in higher education, continues to rely largely on conventional testing methods for assessing student learning. In the current article, another evaluation approach-the oral exam-is examined as a means for building and evaluating the professional communication and oral dialogue skills needed and utilized by business graduates. Prior studies of oral exams in higher education are reviewed, along with the empirical findings from an exploratory investigation of an oral exam in an undergraduate human resource course. Implications for future research and the use of oral exams in business education are also presented. © 2014 by the Association for Business Communication.""Retrieval of bibliographic information from literature searches is now moving from the use of comprehensive centralized data bases into specialized PC-mounted data bases. To be effective, a personal data base must take account of the structure of the literature it contains, as well as provide easy access for record entry and searching. This paper describes bow to design and compile a data base for bibliographic engineering records. Emphasis is given to keyword selection, data record form design, and report format. The data base versatility is demonstrated by an analysis of railway engineering literature which examines the structure, sources, and locations of pertinent bibliographic material. © 1989 IEEE""The accounting profession has recognized the importance of emphasizing written and oral communications skills in the accounting curriculum. Innovations in technology have greatly enhanced educators' abilities to incorporate instruction in such skills. A survey of practitioners indicates strong agreement with the new writing requirements of the CPA exam. In addition, they endorse the use of information technology in preparing documents based on specific models and prescribed criteria.""The ability to communicate effectively remains a critical skill for obtaining a job and achieving success in the workplace; however, many still lack these skills. In particular, graduates lack adequate writing skills. This article advocates the use of problem-based scenarios to teach writing, which focuses on authentic rhetorical framing similar to writing done in the workplace. A sample scenario is provided along with three responses, showing the type of issues involved in helping students develop writing skills appropriate to an organizational context. © 2012 by the Association for Business Communication.""To demonstrate the importance of standardized process modeling notation and its value to technical communicators involved with visualizing business or technical processes. To argue that a standardized process modeling notation can assist with bridging cultural communication gaps brought on by globalized workplaces. Method: A rhetorical analysis emphasizing how effectively technical communication visualizations address audience, purpose, and documentation conventions. Communication visualizations were modeled first using nonstandard and then standardized modeling techniques. The visualizations were generated as part of a qualitative study to represent the business and communication processes of a senior level employee from a software firm. Results: Nonstandard or proprietary data models and visualizations are not readily useful to diverse audiences, especially global audiences. Models should be developed with notation software that supports open standards. Conclusion: Technical communicators should become proficient with process modeling notation and understand the fundamentals of standardized notations such as Uniform Modeling Language (UML) and Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Academics teaching and researching technical communication should be wary of creating a divide between industry and the academy by perpetuating the use of non-standard models. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

SME computer resistors include 1) the slow-plodding neophyte computer users in the far right hand lane, 2) the firms curious about computerization but who are yet to make a purchase decision, idling in neutral on the access ramps, and 3) the business that purchases improper equipment and/or software and ventures onto the ""road"" without proper training and support, being run over by the speeding industry. In the information high-tech world of the 1990s it seems amazing that an estimated quarter of all small businesses still do not have their first personal computer. This article calls upon the innovators of the communications field to look in the rear view mirror to see the businesses left behind in the information expansion race. A model utilizing social learning theory defines a framework for road service [1], getting the small business ""resister"" up to the information superhighway speed limit.""This article examines changing social media practices, arguing that technical communicators and teachers understand their roles as mediators of information and communication technologies. Drawing on a case study growing out of a colloquium on technology diffusion and communication between the Global North and South, the author proposes that technical communicators be attentive to the participatory nature of social media while not assuming that social media replace the dynamics of face-to-face human interaction. © 2014 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""This paper assesses the text structure imposed on patient information leaflets in the European Union (EU). It proposes an alternative structure based on readeroriented research. Method: Two card-sorting studies were used to identify reader expectations. In a closed card-sorting study, participants were provided with scenario questions on medication use and were asked under which of the template headings they expected to find information on each question. In an open sorting task, the schemata of patient information leaflet readers were explored. In this study, participants sorted a large set of sentences that can be found in actual patient information leaflets. Results: The closed card-sorting study reveals that users provided with the EU template structure do not always look at the correct section when searching information about patient situations. The results of the open card-sorting study indicate that readers prefer the following structure: goal of the medicine - directions for use - potential problems - packaging and storage. Conclusion: Card-sorting data help to evaluate and design text structures for genres such as patient information leaflets. The European template does not match users' expectations concerning the leaflet's structure. There is a mismatch between the wording of headings and reader interpretations. A second mismatch has to do with classifying and grouping information. Patient information presented in the alternative format may be expected to improve reading performance.""In the process of working with a variety of corporations to design and produce standards and procedures, the author discovered that, while the need for comprehensive standards and procedures is great, many companies have failed to establish systematic methods for developing them. To help these companies establish a standards and procedures methodology, analysis techniques were instituted that had been developed by and for the data-processing community. It is argued that these techniques, which include top-down analysis of process flow, are effective because they encourage the companies to examine their top-level processes before analyzing their desk procedures. They also encourage the analysis of manual processes that can result in greater procedural efficiencies throughout the organization. The author first looks at some of the reasons companies have for developing written standards and procedures, and at the problems associated with the current state of procedure writing. Then two case studies of companies the author worked with are presented. Finally, the methods are reviewed and some ways they might be implemented by procedures writers are proposed.""The past decade has produced a growing body of evidence suggesting small group-based instructional methods can promote the achievement of a variety of desirable higher educational outcomes. Therefore, within college and university settings, group-oriented instruction has increased. Team Learning goes beyond using temporary groups or assigning occasional group activities. With this approach, students spend approximately 80 percent of their in-class time working in permanent and heterogeneous teams. The system, when used properly, appears to overcome many of the potential problems with using small groups. The methodology empowers both instructor and students. The instructor becomes a facilitator and manager of learning rather than the ""spoon feeder"" of information. The students become active and responsible participants in the learning process rather than passive recipients. The process facilitates effective teamwork in settings where teams gain first-hand experience with the kind of team dynamics they will encounter in high performing teams at work. © by the Association for Business Communication.""A series of team reporting projects is used to teach concepts of audience and written, oral, and interpersonal communication skills in technical and professional communication courses at the University of Texas Arlington. Supplemental to conventional reporting assignments, the projects range from short exercises done in a single class period to extended out-of-class projects involving both a literature review and primary research. In each, students work in small, interdisciplinary groups to solve a problem, prepare a team-written report, and deliver an oral presentation. Short exercises are graded by the instructor; the more extensive reporting projects are graded by peers and by the instructor using evaluation checklists. Students have responded favorably to the projects, and as a result of their team work have enhanced not only communication skills, but problem-solving, decision-making, planning, and management skills as well. Team projects are an effective supplement to conventional reporting assignments.""Many current technical writing handbooks still advise writers to avoid the passive voice except in certain limited situations, primarily when the agent is unknown, understood, unimportant, or better left unnamed. However, a growing body of research indicates that the passive voice has a broader array of rhetorical functions. To identify some of the functions of the passive, as well as the active, voice, the frequencies of active and passive verbs were determined in 185 documents written by twenty-eight civilian and military members of the U.S. Air Force. The frequencies were similar to those in similar types of documents written by nonacademic writers in previous studies. In addition, writers were queried about their reasons for choosing active or passive verbs. While the results of the study confirmed the importance of agency in the choice of active or passive, they also revealed numerous other factors that were significant in writers' choices. The most significant reasons for choosing one type of verb over another were the voice of the verb, organizational requirements, audience awareness, efficiency, genre, euphony, personal preference, agency, emphasis, and topiccomment flow. These results suggest that technical writing instruction and handbooks should promote general principles for the use of both active and passive verbs rather than advising against the use of passive verbs.""Ethical codes are written documents which presume to state the major philosophical principles of an organization and to express its values and beliefs. The present study uses a competing values framework to describe the dimensions of ethical codes, telling us how change-oriented and transformational, instructional, informational, and relational they are in their communication and as representative of the organizational culture. Present results suggest that ethical codes are relationally and informationally dynamic, but exhibit transformational and instructional characteristics to a lesser degree. Findings suggest that ethical codes are generally framed from a defensive position designed to protect the organization from the employee and are not written, for the most part, using guiding or visionary language. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article reports on the results of a large survey sponsored by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), on the use of computers in business communication courses. From a total of 628 AACSB schools, faculty members from 312 schools responded—a response rate of nearly 50 percent. The results of that survey answer two major questions: (1) How and why are we using computers in the business or management communication curriculum? and (2) What hardware and software are we using?. © 1986, Sage Publications.

They are programming a computer to deliver detailed instruction and drill to individual students who need to remedy specific weaknesses identified by the teacher. A flowchart of the instructional program is given. Forty to 50 percent of all mechanical problems in student writing relate to the omission or misuse of commas. Because correct use of commas seems to be the most difficult competency for students to acquire, the authors have chosen a segment on the comma to demonstrate how their system works.""The author used a computer to teach aircraft and automobile mechanics how to write instruction manuals to military specifications. The simplified pilot program flowcharted in this paper can be executed with a computer that has 32 K bytes of random-access memory and a disk drive. The key to success in using your current computer to edit sentence syntax is to limit the range of language you allow your writers to use. Develop a program that allows only the following: verbs contained in the computer lexicon; one verb tense, preferably present tense; active voice; simple sentences, as opposed to compound or complex sentences; two sentence forms, preferably second person imperative and third person indicative. Although the program presented is extremely restrictive, the author believes that a careful analysis of many types of writing projects will show that such tightly binding measures can be imposed upon writers working on a great many types of writing projects. And those writers will still be able to produce clear, well-written copy. What is more, they will be able to do it with less effort, and with less time spent editing, than they have spent on such work before.""This paper presents the use of the dialogic communication model to teach students how to write a report introduction. In the case study presented, the students engaged in discussions and reflections regarding the contextual complexities in the writers' and readers' organizational environments, which helped them adapt their writing to their readers' needs and thought processes. The thinking process that students go through in making their writing more reader centered using this model could be a useful springboard to help students adopt the thinking processes of professional engineers. © 2011 IEEE.""Professional writing is often taught as a service course that sees writing as a set of dis crete skills, with no substantive relation to ethics or to students' future scientific, business, or engineering activities. This perception derives from the adoption of scientiftc assumptions by writing teachers, and it produces two inadequate and conflicting approaches to writing contexts. An adequate perception considers writing as a course in rhetoric, necessarily involving ethics and integrally related to students' other professional activities. Using the classical enthymeme helps students learn not only that ethical implications to writing exist but also how these implications can be managed to produce effective and socially responsible writing. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Reports that classify, partition, analyze, describe, illustrate, compare, and contrast essentially define a concept or problem. Thus, classification, partition, description, illustration, comparison, and contrast represent seven of fifteen devices which can be used to expand definitions. The expanded definition, as a beginning assignment (after audience analysis), can show how these same devices are embedded in the major ways of organizing information for reports, technical descriptions, process analyses, and instructions - topics later introduced in the course. Furthermore, developing content about these specific devices helps students to catalog mentally information about a subject and to organize and present this information precisely.""The Internet already has become a pervasive force in our society, and projections are that it will continue to become even more so in the future. We educators need to be sure we are preparing our students adequately to use the rich resources found on the Internet.

This analysis points out that companies may prefer to have their PR executives function in roles that are decades out of date-as press agents (phase I) or as publicity agents (phase II) rather than as PR counselors (phase III). The result is that problems that could be solved when they are small grow into crises unnecessarily. The effective phase III PR counselor functions as an “early-warning system” by following a five-step process to improve the flow of communication between an organization and its many publics. © 1989 IEEE"Portfolios have long been a staple in professional writing courses: both in employment materials assignments and in entire classes that ask students to reflect on their experiential learning. Portfolios may also be used effectively in business communication teaching methods courses. This article details the justification and methodology for having a teaching portfolio as the capstone assignment in a business communication pedagogy course. It also explains how this portfolio may be used to anticipate programmatic assessment and verification of entry-level business communication courses during the accreditation process. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication."Though not a cure-all for society's ills, the Web is an important medium that is changing the way we work and learn. For graduate education in technical communication, the Web is a new tool that facilitates adult learning through electronic interactive communication. Using the Web as the medium for asynchronous distance learning allows for a high degree of learner exploration and interactivity, without the participants' being captive to a particular location and time. In Mercer University's M.S. program in technical communication management, students communicate with each other and with the instructors through a course home page, which provides students with course syllabus, lectures, outlines, assignments, requirements, a LISTSERV, and technical support. All graduate student research assignments are electronic and posted to the course home page on the Net. Additional improvements continue to be made to the electronic learning environment for these graduate courses.""Total Quality Management (TQM) is an approach that encourages employees at all levels of an organization to make suggestions about how work should be done and to take an active role in improving processes. Although business organizations have applied TQM principles with considerable success, its use in higher education has been largely limited to administrative processes. Many teaching faculty in schools of business are uncomfortable with applying TQM principles to the class room, often because the idea of empowering students requires thinking differently about their potential for participation in planning processes for the learning environment. Yet a survey of students and faculty suggests that a TQM approach can increase students' learning in a class, help students support one another in a cooperative learning environment, and foster positive feelings toward the instructor, even one who maintains the necessary high standards.""Technical-writing instructors are often hindered by their lack of understanding about U.S. government documents. However, U.S. documents are particularly valuable to technical-writing instructors because of the documents ready availability and tremendous diversity. The purpose of this paper is threefold: to explain how to use U.S. documents as models in the classroom, to guide instructors to various indices in documents so that they may better help their students get started on research reports, and to show how one may obtain documents to keep. A good working knowledge of documents is an important asset, especially for technical-writing instructors. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Evidence presented suggests that this model is insufficient to describe the complex interaction of science and engineering through the formal communication system of science. Engineers who publish are clearly more literature-conscious, and were found to have a stronger science orientation than is typically ascribed to the average engineer.""It is argued that the introduction of reports in the form of structured, retrievable technical memorandums in a medium-sized to large-sized engineering company increases the esteem of workers while decreasing the reinvention process and minimizing the time spent by supervision for training and evaluation. The primary value of the technical memo is seen as that of thought clarification, which in turn requires clear writing. The implementation of such a system is discussed. The memorandum format is shown by example.""In this paper, we describe our approach of using value-sensitive design to guide the design, development, and implementation of health information systems for use in rural areas of two developing countries in Africa. By using shared conceptual investigation, we are able to create a generalized list of stakeholders and values that span multiple projects without losing any of the power of the conceptual investigation. This process can be applied to other projects to develop a stronger set of stakeholders and values.

This study, based on responses provided by a random sampling of ABCA members, examines one of the causes: varying evaluative criteria.

These same studies show that such abuse decreases worker satisfaction, undermines relationships, and distracts workers from functioning as team members committed to common goals. This study examines a classic example of verbal abuse and harassment in the workplace-that of Union Civil War General William Rosecrans toward his subordinates during a campaign conducted in Tennessee during 1863. It can, in fact, be argued that Rosecrans' abusive language was a major factor in the Union defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga in September of 1863.""Pretentious, wordy writing occurs because written English is different from spoken English and because writers have developed bad habits. Four specific varieties of verbal pollution are (1) the smothered verb, (2) the freight-train adjectival phrase, (3) the indiscriminate use of jargon, and (4) the habitual hedge. Once their causes and symptoms are understood, these faults are easy to detect and eliminate.""Discusses the intrinsic properties of visual codings, as opposed to verbal ones Establishes that visual representations, because they are limited to conveying the concrete, are no panacea: words convey the abstract better than a thousand pictures""The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of two types of motivational elements - verification steps and personal stories - in an instruction manual for a cell phone targeted at senior users (between 60 and 70 years). Research questions: What are the effects of adding verification steps and personal stories to an instruction manual on: (1) Seniors' confidence in being able to work with a cell phone? (2) Seniors' motivation to work with a cell phone? (3) Seniors' effectiveness and efficiency in performing tasks, and their satisfaction with the cell phone and the instruction manual (usability)? Literature review: To optimize products and services for older users, the literature suggests that two specific motivational elements may be beneficial: (1) verification steps, which provide information at the end of procedures to allow users to check if these procedures were performed correctly. These appear to users as part of conventional procedural information in user instructions and (2) personal stories, which are anecdotes or testimonials that describe how a fictitious user succeeded in completing a procedure. Methodology: We conducted a quantitative experiment in which 59 seniors between 60 and 70 years of age participated. They performed a number of tasks with a cell phone, using a version of the instruction manual with added verification steps, or a version with additional personal stories, or a control version without motivational elements. We measured participants' confidence, their motivation, and usability by asking them to answer several questionnaires and by measuring task performance. Results and conclusions: Results support the use of verification steps or personal stories as motivational elements in user instructions as they can positively affect confidence, motivation, and usability, especially when senior users encounter setbacks. © 1988-2012 IEEE."Technical writing is a discipline with clear limitations in both language and ideology. These limits pose a special problem for the teacher. Technical writing instructors tend to dwell at length upon the value of simple generalizations and also capitalize heavily upon the comic effects of bad writing. The vices of '%'easy generalities'%' and '%'easy comedy'%' must first be understood in order to be avoided."Victor W. Pagé was either the first or one of the first to make a living primarily as a technical communicator in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s. His 33 automotive and aviation books published by the Norman W. Henley Company were popular with both the public and critics because they contained timely, comprehensive coverage of novel technology; profuse illustrations; occasional analogies; easy-to-access information; well-established expertise; and sophisticated employment of task orientation. Page was able to publish many books quickly because he reused manufacturers' and his own material and methods of organization. He was also able to communicate his novel information effectively because he had both extensive firsthand experience with early automobiles and planes and because he was continually involved in teaching. Victor Pagé's early twentieth-century work demonstrates both what have become mainstream techniques in technical communication and a number of unique rhetorical strategies.""With an ecological approach to the genres that circulate within communities of practice, this article traces the overlap between technical communication and online gaming communities in terms of their rhetorical uses of technical communication genres.

But are they the most effectice method in today's high tech world? This article reports an attempt to determine if face-to-face meetings are as effective as their electronic counterpart—the video teleconference.

Use of video tape reduces the cost of conducting technical schools. Limited results indicate that video-taped technical reports convey information about as well as do written technical reports although some users prefer audio-tape cassettes and recorders for automatic audio synchronization with 35 mm slides."Based on a quantitative survey of Norwegian business travelers, this study compares their use of face-to-face (FTF) meetings and videoconferences (VCs). The study finds that access and use of VCs are determined mainly by industry and the geographical structure of the enterprise. It also finds that VCs and FTF meetings differ along several dimensions, suggesting that these two modes of communication fulfill slightly different needs. Based on the survey results, the authors propose a framework to understand the emerging role of VCs. This framework would address both relational and task-based dimensions. © SAGE Publications 2012.""As more and more companies use videoconferencing to conduct business, training students to communicate through this medium becomes increasingly important. With the rapid development of videoconferencing, business schools should investigate equipment purchase, for it may be within their budgets.

In a situation parallel to that of the earliest computers, both military and game applications seem to be the driving forces in virtual reality development. Understanding these influences may help us prepare for the role of technical communicators in building virtual reality applications for education and industry and aid us in predicting and influencing both the technology and the ways we prepare communicators for the future.""Brevity, as defined by ancient rhetoricians, means much more than using few words instead of many. It indicates a human excellence, a virtue—in this case, a virtue designating a fundamental feature of excellent communication. On either side of this virtue lurks a vice: obscurity at one extreme, prolixity at the other. Brevitas dwells between the two extremes, in the golden mean of effective communication""This article provides a fresh examination of claims that biotechnology and other high profile areas of scientific research and development create a ""virtuous cycle"" that delivers benefits to society and ecology through an array of consumer products. Specifically, the article investigates who and what has agency in this virtuous cycle and who and what does not. I argue that official discourses on and definitions of biotechnology create strict demarcations not only on who can act in relation to biotechnology research development options, but also on where and at which stages of the virtuous cycle these agents can act. For example, scientists are presented as passive rather than active agents whose influence is limited to the laboratory context despite rhetorical use of their identity and credibility across all contexts of product development and consumption explored. Agency is highly significant in biotechnology and other areas of scientific advance because it determines who or what has moral decision making power regarding the place of new technologies in society. The article concludes with a discussion of the social and ethical impacts of these demarcations of agency in biotechnology's virtuous cycle."Illegible and uncomprehensible visual aids often result from confusion about sizes of lettering and symbols between the original artwork andits projected image.

This study uses empirical methods to explore the lore surrounding design principles. The study took the form of two stages: a quantitative literature review to determine what design principles are mentioned most often in discourse on design, and a card sorting exercise to explore the relationships designers, design educators, and design students saw among the most common design principles. Along with the card sorting exercise, I used pre- and post-exercise surveys to gauge how participants felt and thought about design principles and their use in design practice. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Headings in text provide critical signals that help a reader discern a writer's structural treatment of a topic. Today, writers and editors have powerful formatting and typographical tools available in word processing and desktop publishing software that can be applied to headings to visually reveal or signal the structure of text, and thus the author's perspective. The results of the studies presented in this article, however, suggest that 1) visual discriminations among headings are easier for a reader to make when headings vary on fewer rather than more formatting and typographical dimensions, 2) size is the most powerful visual cue to a heading's hierarchical position, 3) relative size differences among different levels of headings of about 20% are more discriminable than are absolute size differences, and 4) formatting cues are perceived by readers consistently but not necessarily conventionally. © 1992 IEEE""Research suggests that visual information plays an important role in affecting receivers' perceptions. Consequently, examining the ethical implications of techniques for presenting visual information seems warranted. This article addresses the ethics of visual information by first reviewing general principles of ethics. This is followed by applying these principles to a critique of standard visual techniques, including issues of construction and issues of data representation. The article concludes by offering standards for the creation and assessment of ethical visuals. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""Stallworth Williams introduces concepts of visual rhetoric and ethics for a classroom exercise in the analysis and revision of a sales letter. This article revisits Stallworth Williams's proposed teaching strategies, suggesting that not only do students need to be instructed in elements of visual design, but they must also be taught to link those elements to specific decorative, indicative, or informative purposes. This method teaches students to design documents that meet shared goals (designer and recipient) and to recognize where designs fail in purpose, so revisions can be made using deliberate choice, based on a systematic framework. © 2012 Association for Business Communication.""This paper oresents a model for the design of information products.

A visual pattern helps the technically oriented writer visualize the development of the thesis or subject and plot it against a visual model. We suggest replacing the loose form of the outline with actual shapes that serve as visual guides for the development of the thesis. Here are the results of an experiment in which the author used visual patterns to teach organization to technically oriented writers. A cooperative venture between a professional society and an academic institution led to the development of a teaching technique that can be used in workshops in industry and in modules in the classroom."Online documentation is primarily a visual medium. Many well-written online documents fail because their visual design does not account for the many differences between the paper page and the display screen.

Results indicate that programs typically do not require a course in visual rhetoric, and on average, 20% or less of teaching in undergraduate courses is dedicated to visual communication. The findings suggest that business communication curricula may not adequately prepare students for the multimodal communication tasks they are likely to encounter in the workplace, particularly those tasks that rely on knowledge of visual rhetoric. Possible solutions include adding courses, integrating visual communication more deeply into existing courses, contextualizing existing design projects to ensure they are more than software exercises, and incorporating visual communication into other typical course projects. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication."Presents a framework for analyzing imagery in multi-modal print documents and Web sites Demonstrates how images and text work together to make meaning for readers/users Provides analytical tools and tips to help choose still images to enhance textual messages"Emphasis on page design, as an aid to visual accessibility, did not receive attention in modern technical writing until the 1970s. However, accounting documents and instructional texts utilized format and document design strategies as early as the twelfth century to enhance the organization of quantitative data and linear bookkeeping entries. Format in text was used to reflect the arrangement used in oral accounting practices and to produce uniform documents. Thus, format was integral to the rise of pragmatic literacy of the commercial reader. During the Renaissance, these early format strategies received impetus from Ramist method. The result was design strategies that attempted to capture the rigid principles of organization fundamental to commercial accounting. These early accounting documents also illustrate the plain style that would become the focus of the later decades of the seventeenth century. Clarity in language paralleled clarity in page design for the sole purpose of eliminating ambiguity on the page and on the sentence level. Plain style was thus nurtured by financial forces long before the advent of natural science.""Visual ethics discussions usually consist of accuracy or injury issues. We note a third area of visual ethics that has been largely unexplored: the ethics of choosing decorative or indicative graphics over informative graphics. Oral presentations particularly tend to favor decorative and indicative graphics when informative ones would be more useful. Using philosopher C. S. Peirce’s three-part typology of rhetorical goals, we discuss the ethical implications of choosing the most effective graphics possible for visual communication, especially for visuals used in oral presentations. We distinguish among three types of visuals in terms of goals: decorative and indicative images with perception-mediating goals versus informative graphics with language-mediating goals. This distinction between perception-mediating images and language-mediating graphics serves as our primary focus, the core basis of our ethical critique of visual communication in general and of technical presentations using PowerPoint slides in particular."Explores what it means to think visually and spatially in hypertexts and how users react and maneuver in real and virtual three-dimensional spaces Offers four principles of visual thinking that can be applied when developing hypertexts."Authors of technical papers have many visual/graphic aids available to them. The most common are: grid graphs, tables, bar charts, flow charts, maps, pie diagrams, and drawings and sketches. Grid graphs are used to show relationships. Tables allow the reader to make comparisons of data. The bar chart is another form of the grid graph and is used for the same purpose. A flow chart gives the reader a visual description of a process. Maps show the location of specific features. Pie diagrams show the proportional breakdown of a topic. Pictures and sketches show the reader exactly what is being talked about in the report. Visual/graphic aids allow the technical writer to condense and present his information in an esthetically pleasing manner; in addition, these aids serve as psychological white space."Describes visualization methods used in the design of many projects intended to improve the Quality of life in developing countries Demonstrates that the technique improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the problem-solving process and the quality of the solution.Argues that the computer science orientation to data visualizations Is severely limited for addressing many usability concerns Reviews the literature on the usability of data visualizations and shows its contributions and blind spots."Report the results of a rhetorical analysis that examines the ways that data visualizations of epidemic disease influence risk perception in global contexts, propose strategies that technical communicators can draw from when constructing data visualizations for intercultural audiences in crisis and emergency risk scenarios, and discuss implications for technical communication practice. Method: Rhetorical analysis of four select infographics created by the New York Times to communicate Ebola risk during the outbreak that began in West Africa in 2014 using the following facets associated with design in global contexts: use of warm and cool colors, high versus low-context, and collectivism versus individualism. Results: Data visualizations dramatically shape how risks are perceived. Languagebased content may communicate one message about risk, while the visual strategies used in data visualizations may communicate a very different message. Rather than emphasizing control over the outbreak, I argue that the visual message in the infographics in this analysis communicates the opposite. Maps show Ebola breaching national (Figures 1 and 4) and international borders (Figure 2), and line graphs (Figure 3) show sharp increases in cases and deaths in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Conclusion: Warm colors increase risk perception. Further, data visualizations are high-context, collectivistic forms of visual communication, which lessen risk perception among experts but intensify risk perception among nonexperts. Technical communicators can draw from the following guidelines when constructing data visualizations that communicate risk for intercultural audiences: show quantitative information using a variety of visualization strategies, include explanatory text and/ or visuals to more fully contextualize data visualizations, and add comparative data visualizations. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

Both methods draw on network as a framework: a Latourian actor-network theory analysis and a network analysis. The shared object of analysis is a digital humanities and digital media research lab that is the outcome of the collective and coordinated efforts of researchers and other stakeholders at North Carolina State University. The authors show how the two methods are drawn to different objects of study, different data sources, and different assumptions about how data can be reduced and made understandable. The authors conclude by arguing that although these methods yield different outlooks on the same object, their findings are mutually informing. © 2015 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""This study examines the visual rhetoric used in Chinese and American promotional business communication. Comparing banking and financial product brochures published in the two countries, the study finds similar as well as different visual strategies. Most importantly, the Chinese samples frequently use visual metaphors, whereas the American samples hardly do. Prompted by this finding, I review relevant literature on visual metaphors and examine their structures and rhetorical functions. In addition, the study suggests that buyer images and cartoon images are used differently in the two countries, whereas product-related images are used similarly. I explore the contextual and cultural roots of these findings and offer suggestions on how to visually communicate with the Chinese audience and other international audiences. © 2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc."Outlines the history of information visualization Describes how the articles in this issue help us understand the principles and practices of information visualization Challenges technical communicators to expand their view of visual communication."Focuses on visual composition within the workforce as perceived by speakers who use visuals to instruct, persuade, or inform  Maintains that the results of this study can help a presenter incorporate audience sensitivity into visual design.""It has been suggested that teaching professional writing students how to think visually can improve their ability to design visual texts. This article extends this suggestion and explores how the ability to think visuospatially influenced students' success at designing visual texts in a small upper-division class on visual communication. Although all the students received the same instruction, students who demonstrated higher spatial faculties were more successful at developing and designing visual materials than were the other students in the class. This result suggests that the ability to think visuospatially is advantageous for learning how to communicate visually and that teaching students to think visuospatially should be a primary instructional focus to maximize all student learning. © 2011 SAGE Publications.""Although relatively little attention has been given to the voice assessment of student work, at least when compared with more traditional forms of text-based review, the attention it has received strongly points to a promising form of review that has been hampered by the limits of an emerging technology. A fresh review of voice assessment in light of recent technological developments strongly suggests that this form of review is now ready for broad adoption. Favorable student reception of voice assessment and its potential for raising instructor awareness around the review process itself argue further for considering it afresh. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Business communication instructors are often overwhelmed by the task of grading writing assignments.

Beth Israel Medical Center, a 1180 bed teaching hospital in New York City, embarked in 1991 on a plan to implement clinical information computer systems throughout its facilities. The project manager considered the unique cultural and organizational aspects of Beth Israel in order to develop a strategy for the project. Strategy objectives included promoting broad educational awareness, establishing quick project momentum and visibility, gaining the approval of a competing organizational department, and developing a productive and effective project team. The start-up phase of any project can make or break the project. If one does not set the correct tone and build the correct organization, one can easily doom the project before it has ever had a chance to develop. © 1993 IEEE""This limited case study examines the situated-language practices associated with the production of negative letters in an insurance company. Using genre and sociocultural theories, the study combines textual analyses of a set of negative letters together with writers' accounts of producing these letters to identify effective (as defined by the company) strategies for composing this correspondence. These letters are examples of generic action, and they demonstrate that genres function as constellations of regulated, improvisational strategies triggered by the interaction between individual socialization and an organization. Moreover, these constellations of resources express a particular chronotopic relation to space and time, and this relation is always axiological or value oriented. In other words, genres express space/time relations that reflect current social beliefs regarding the placement and actions of human individuals in space and time. The article identifies some of the strategies that characterize effective negative messages in this organization. It also critiques this text type for enacting a set of practices and related chronotopic orientation that are against the interests of its readers and writers.""Recommends discovering and documenting the origins of each work used in our products to ensure that we hold the appropriate rights.

Researchers point to the complexity of first person plural pronouns: not only can they refer to different participants in a communicative situation, but they can also be used to avoid other referential forms. In organizational discourse, however, transparency is of the utmost importance to ensure efficient communication. Based on the minute analysis of 3700 we-forms in a corpus of internal communications documents, we developed a framework for the interpretation of the we-form. Thirteen (con)textual and situational identifiers of different kinds are discussed and illustrated. In some cases the interpretation of the we-form is indicated by a single identifying element, in other cases a combination of identifying elements strengthens the interpretation.? ©?2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Companies are increasingly using written ethical codes to communicate their principles and practices; however, there have been few attempts to examine the complex language decisions the composers of such documents are likely to face in their attempt to “manage” the differing expectations of their readers. To reveal some of the rhetorical concerns that arise in constructing a code that is truly affiliative and inclusive of the readership and yet reflective of the goals of the corporation itself, this study focuses on the Dana Corporation's code. Using the standard linguistic technique of substitution to examine possible alternatives, especially the ways in which Dana refers to itself and its employees, brings to light some of the subtle rhetorical decisions that composers of ethical codes need to negotiate. © 1990, Sage Publications.

Research question: What is the relationship between Web 2.0 use, and work-based communication processes and outcomes in China? Literature review: Literature in the fields of information systems and media and communication research supports the value of Web 2.0 for organizations. However, how Web 2.0 can facilitate the organizational communication process and subsequently improve performance is underinvestigated. By adapting and extending the communicative ecology framework and previously published work, we developed and tested a theoretical model to investigate these impacts in the Chinese workplace. Methodology: We conducted a quantitative study using the survey method, with participants randomly selected from a panel database in China. Results and conclusions: We analyzed survey data from 179 organizational employees and found that vertical and horizontal communication contribute significantly to individual and teamwork performance, with high levels of variance explained. In this study, we provide empirical evidence of how Web 2.0 applications enable employees to reach out to collaborators and business partners, thereby boosting individual productivity and team collaboration. The study also highlights the fit between Web 2.0 and the need for organizational horizontal communication in this era of knowledge, information, and creativity. Future researchers should verify the research model in different countries, including local contextual characteristics as either independent variables or moderators. © 2016 IEEE.""This article presents an overview of the topic of web access for people with disabilities. First, we describe the four basic disabilities and explain the benefits of making sites accessible, as well as the reasons that more sites are not accessible.

Despite the frequency of these redesigns, there appears to be little evidence to explain what kinds of changes are incorporated into each updated version of a web presence. To understand how commercial organizations transform their web presence, we conduct a content analysis and a cluster analysis of press releases describing redesign initiatives in the late 1990s. Findings suggest that the majority of companies redesigned their web presence to expand information and change navigation protocols. Surprisingly, the addition of interactive features such as online ordering and community communication channels is present in only 20% of the redesign cases studied. According to the groups provided by the cluster analysis, most of the changes reported in these press releases are centered on improving the usability of the web presence. Based on this evidence, we conclude that initial transformations to commercial websites were more driven by the need to effectively communicate new information than by the addition of e-commerce features. © 2005 IEEE."The issue of special needs by describing problems that language-impaired users may face in getting information from the Internet is examined.

The study serves to bridge the gap between theoretical research of rhetoric and the needs of business communication practitioners by identifying the means of persuasion that can be used by online crowd funding entrepreneurs. Method: Qualitative analysis of thirteen crowd funding project descriptions posted on a major Web Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. rhetorical techniques via text coding. The sample included the most-funded projects to date, one from each of the thirteen project categories on Kickstarter. Aristotle's concept of ethos, pathos, and logos served as a basic framework for developing a more detailed classification of rhetorical means of persuasion used in the projects. Results: The most-funded projects have been found to contain all three types of rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, and logos), subdivided into a total of twelve specific subtypes most commonly encountered in the descriptions from the sample. The subtype definitions have been developed and refined over the course of several reviews. Conclusion: The research data made it possible to create a ""rhetorical profile"" of a successful crowd funding project description representing a summary of the rhetorical techniques identified during the study. Although this summary reflects a hypothetical all-inclusive case, it can be used as a benchmark when drafting crowd funding project descriptions. The study also identified specific directions for future research that could determine the influence of project description rhetoric on donor decisions.""The cost effectiveness of internet-based communications in the ever more fully networked business environment continues to drive the use of web surveys for corporate information gathering. However, simply applying traditional survey techniques to the web can result in significant shortcomings in the data so gathered. Recent research has been directed at these issues, within the context of web surveys as a general research tool. We discuss the application of that research to the narrower organizational context. This article synthesizes from the literature on web-based surveying and from the authors' own experiences. It suggests a design framework for managers and communications professionals interested in increasing the statistical validity of web surveys deployed in an organizational context. The results of a recent organizational web survey developed and administered within the framework guidelines support the efficacy of the framework.""Good maintenance documentation contributes to product-line image and customer satisfaction.

It argues that the authors do not engage in ethical inquiry as it is defined traditionally. Instead, they engage in the ethics-related activities known as moral casuistry, which deduces moral judgements, and moralism, which prescribes moral principles. The authors deduce and prescribe, but they do not justify or critically examine the underlying principles of morality. The analysis also suggests that at least two of the textbooks introduce ideas that are either inconsistent with traditional ethical theories or are subject to the objections that philosophers have raised against them in previous ethical inquiries. Finally, the article recommends that authors avoid approaches that are either strictly rhetorical or provide no ethical guidelines for students. They should avoid resorting to cursory accounts of traditional ethical theories because briefly mentioning philosophers' ethical approaches has very little practical value. They should also treat moral principles, not as objective and self-evident statements of fact, but as evaluative assumptions whose truth-values and meaning are both tentative and lacking universal agreement. © 1998, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc."This article analyzes the results of a survey made by Mr. Smith in connection with technical writing seminars he has conducted. It also provides some helpful suggestions about report writing which he communicated to his students."Two recent studies of writing are reviewed. One of them (Invention as a Social Act by K. B. LeFevre) exposes and reexamines long-held and often counterproductive assumptions about the balance of individual and social elements in the act of writing. The other (Plato, Derrida, and Writing by J. Neel) does the same for the way writing is thought to work in relation to reality, thought, and speech. It is suggested that these books may help the reader become a more effective communicator by better understanding what theories implicitly govern his or her own communication environment and practice."[No abstract available]"We collected written critical incidents from young business practitioners entering our MBA program, asking each person to describe a work-related communication episode that had challenged him or her and to answer several questions about the episode. Most often, respondents reported face-to-face oral events that required the respondent to function as an advocate or to manage conflict. Both gender and first language correlated with responses, suggesting that persons of different genders and cultures have differing business experi ences or draw differing conclusions from their experiences. On the basis of these results, we call for management communication courses to give sufficient attention to oral communication events that require spontaneity, persuasion, conflict management, and boundary spanning. © 1997 by the Association for Business Communication.""Despite the efforts of individual parents and teachers, and even of entire agencies such as the National Science Foundation, there is still a significant gap between the numbers of men and women who enter scientific and technological professions—and an even greater gap between numbers of Angle and numbers of minority students who do so. In this article we present the course’s design and the material for implementing a course in which students explore the current status of women and minorities in the scientific and technical professions and the possible reasons for that status. We offer it as a model for the integration of intercultural and gender issues into the technical communication classroom. Since we believe that cultural and gender issues are neither scientific nor technological but humanities issues, core readings for the course are humanities texts. By working in teams of culturally and gender-diverse colleagues, students explore the intercultural concerns and gender issues in the field of technical communication. Students conduct personal interviews, study published reports, obtain policy statements and current statistics, analyze data, draw conclusions, and submit a comprehensive technical report to audiences who might act on those findings—the National Science Foundation, for example. © 1992 IEEE""Finds that user's guides, reference manuals, and help account for most products, and about half are print Reports that no widely used method or metric of assessing effectiveness exists""Investigate the match between content published by the Transactions and content sought by its readers. Research Questions: What content does the IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication publish? How does that compare to the content published by other journals in the field? And what content do readers of the Transactions want to read? Literature Review: Researchers in most fields occasionally analyze the entire body of literature within a discipline to assess the current state of the literature, identify leading works, assess the state of the literature, provide a basis for changing the direction of a journal, and assess alignment among parts of the literature. Methodology: To identify what journals published, researchers used the STC Body of Knowledge schema and a list of categories of research methods that classify all peer-reviewed articles published between January 2006 and December 2010 in the Transactions, Journal of Business and Technical Communication, Technical Communication, and Technical Communication Quarterly. To identify reader preferences of the Transactions, researchers surveyed members of the IEEE Professional Communication Society about their preferences for content and types of research. Results and Discussion: In terms of the topics covered, the three most widely covered topics in the Transactions were: (1) Deliverables, (2) Information Design and Development, and (3) Academic Programs. Readers prefer (1) About Technical and Professional Communication, (2) Information Design and Development, and (3) Research Theory, and Practice. The three least-covered topics were (1) Business Knowledge, (2) About Technical Communication, and (3) Technical Communication Standards. Of least interest to participants were: (1) Deliverables, (2) Quality Assurance, (3) Management, and (4) Technical Communication Standards. The Transactions primarily publishes experiments, surveys, and tutorials while readers prefer case studies, literature reviews, and tutorials. © 2011 IEEE.""The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of the number of practice and feed back sessions on the development of select interpersonal communication skills. Measures were taken to determine whether the effects were only immediate or whether the subjects retained the information and new communication skills for a longer period of time. To test the effects associated with various combinations of practice and video feedback, 211 subjects were assigned to ten treatment groups plus a control group. Both cognitive recall scores and evaluations of the performance of interpersonal communication skills were taken two days prior to training, immediately after instruction, and both two-days and a two-weeks later. Results indicated that practice and feedback had a marked influence on the acquisi tion of interpersonal communication skills, but each seemed to be influencing different aspects of learning. Practice initially heightened the potential to learn the information about what to do, while feedback increased performance scores. Over time, however, the combination of both practice and video feedback produced the greatest effect on long term performance scores. Decay in the levels of achievement after training were more rapid in performance than in cognitive scores. Overlearning through practice and feedback was recommended as a way to produce long-term information retention and sustained skill performance. © 1989, Sage Publications.

To travel without the aid of tools (cars, buses, and planes), that is, to walk, barely means travel at all in the modern sense. Likewise, to think in the modern sense means thought with tools. It is not enough to speak, or write with pen and paper, or even a typewriter. We have little choice, to be competitive, but to word-process, to send email, and to build hypertext. The thoughts we think we are having in the relative comfort of our own heads mean little, until they are written out, published to others, and subjected to natural-selection tests for validity. Beyond this, we must be keenly aware of the texts produced by others and the physical circumstances that produced them. These are simultaneously the best representation of a whole community's thought, and also the best tools that we can use to further advance our own thought.""Previous literature focuses on what practitioners should be doing to demonstrate the value of technical communication, rather than what they actually do. This study addresses the gap by asking managers about the extent to which they track two measures of value—productivity and effectiveness—as well as the expectations of sponsors for receiving reports on these issues.Method: A survey of corporate communication, training, and technical communication groups was conducted. Participants were recruited through local chapters of the STC and the American Medical Writers Association. Ninety technical communication managers responded.Results: The evidence suggests that activities for tracking productivity by technical communication managers are limited. Technical communication groups rarely solicit feedback and perceptions on individual communication products and employ usability testing on a limited basis. Technical communicators rarely track return on investment (ROI). Technical communication managers feel limited pressure to report productivity and effectiveness. The most significant criteria against which the productivity and effectiveness of technical communication groups is assessed is word of mouth. The evidence only partially supports this entering belief: Customer surveys play an important role in assessing general impressions of technical communication products.Conclusions: These results are consistent with earlier studies and suggest that despite a discussion about means of assessing the productivity and effectiveness of technical communicators that has spanned over a quarter of a century, none of the methods of assessment has reached wide use. The study also suggests that perceptions are the most significant factor in assessing the value of technical communication products and services, and should be given more focus in future research and writing on this topic. © 2014, Technical Communication.

Using qualitative and quantitative methods, motivations predictive of employees' decisions to share and seek knowledge beyond their work group were examined in the present study. Results of a quantitative survey (N = 480) found that employees who perceived greater organizational rewards for sharing spent more hours sharing knowledge beyond their immediate work group. In contrast, employees who perceived knowledge as a means of achieving upward organizational mobility were less likely to share and somewhat more likely to seek information. In addition, employees were less motivated to share and seek knowledge beyond their work group to the extent that they believed that reciprocity norms governed information exchange and to the extent they identified more strongly with their subunit relative to the organization. Practical implications and directions for future research are explored in the concluding discussion of the article. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Qualitative audience responses to editorial treatment and non-treatment in terms of comprehension and evaluation of message and source were compared. This experiment was conducted in response to the trend in government and industry to cut back on editorial expenses by issuing 'quick and dirty' reports.

These processes include: invention, adaptation for audience, clarification of purpose, organization, control of voice or persona, and polishing. This list is based on an informal survey of 125 writers in business, industry, and government. Methods for teaching the processes are derived from texts and articles in rhetoric, composition, technical writing, and business writing. Although the classroom application of these processes is illustrated in an analysis of one writing assignment, the memo, the processes can be taught in assignments ranging from job application materials to negative letters to proposals to formal reports. They can serve as the foundation of any course in business writing. © 1981, Sage Publications.

The educators who design these new programs have three major resources to help them determine what their programs should look like: descriptions of existing programs; published articles that discuss program design in a general way; and advice from practicing professionals. Even when taken together, these resources do not provide educators with a completely satisfactory basis for designing programs. A more satisfactory resource is a model of what the profession does. This model consists of 1) a definition of the common professional aim of all practicing technical and scientific communicators, 2) an abstract - and idealized - description of the general activities that practicing communicators perform as they pursue that aim, and 3) a catalog of the major features of the contexts within which these communicators pursue their common aim.

The Club's goal for 1981-1982 is to hold two workshops for young specialized communicators from developing countries and to publish their proceedings as technical manuals to help train still others. The article endeavors to identify and classify some of the most critical and widespread scientific and technological problems confronting mankind today and in the foreseeable future. The problems are presented as titles, usually briefly elaborated with statements or questions. They include such topics are: Feeding the World; Health and Human Biology; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Development Policy for Mastering Science and Technology; Information and Communication; Absorbing Military Research into the Civil Sector.

Here are some ways to convince management that the packaging cost is a good investment and a multitude of practical tips on how to dress a document for reader appeal. The author discusses the packaging aspects as follows: individual book size; cover; binding; inside; box; and distribution. It is his experience that any decision made for one of these aspects of packaging probably affects most of the others. In practice, one may have to change a plan a number of times, revisiting all earlier decisions as soon as one changes any one component of the plan.

This article discusses what they should look for in both the equipment and the organization that sells and supports it."The results of an empirical study made of the report-reading habits of a group of Westinghouse managers are presented. The author systematically docuements two types of information: (1) how managers read reports; and (2) what managers look for in reports. Useful checklists for various types of reports are provided and a section on the responsibility of management in the reporting process is included.This article tells how a specification should be written and gives examples of both correct and incorrect test requirements.The article discusses abstracting and teaching of skills for writing abstracts. Good business writing techniques are essential in abstract writing since rapid reading and 100-200 word limits are common. Professionally written abstracts cost dollars and require a specialized talent to write. Author-written abstracts are generally considered the poorest. Authors developing abstract writing skill can ensure better communication with their audiences and eventually reduce the growing cost of information retrieval systems."To describe the practice of technical documentation on software user forums and consider what value technical communicators add when they are no longer solely responsible for generating help content. Argue that documentation needs undergo a shift as users’ tasks expand beyond what is directly accommodated in the software’s design. Users no longer need stabilization knowledge (knowledge of what software is designed to do) but possibility knowledge (knowledge of what the software is capable of doing). Method: Interviews with moderators and frequent posters on four software user communities for Microsoft Excel, Adobe InDesign, Mozilla Thunderbird, and GIMP. Questions probe the participants’ sense of what makes helpful contributions on software user forums. Answers are coded thematically. Results: Moderators and frequent posters stress the importance of maintaining high quality content and high quality social interactions. High quality content is that which is credible and situationally authentic, expansive, and targeted. High quality interactions are those that effectively involve multiple members of a community and distribute responsibility for addressing user problems to those community members with the most suitable experience/expertise. Conclusions: While community members may adequately generate the necessary help content, technical communicators are needed for abilities that are also strongly associated with the profession but that often seem of secondary importance. Technical communicators may be skilled moderators who can use their genre knowledge to correct, clarify, and contextualize software problems; use their interpersonal skills to help maintain ties among members of the community; and use their knowledge of text usability and organizational communication to create infrastructure for storing and retrieving help content that is performed in the user community.""Reviews workplace stress research and the ineffectiveness of popular stress-control methods Recommends that technical communicators increase their influence, education, and decision-making latitude to counter the effects of stress""Perceptions of justice are an important consideration for organizations as past research has shown that when employees feel they are treated fairly, positive outcomes result and negative outcomes can be avoided. The current study examined the effects of private and public delivery of positive and negative feedback on perceptions of procedural and interactional justice. Although past research found no differences for channel when comparing face-to-face to email, current results indicate that differences existed across channel characteristic such that private delivery was viewed as more procedurally and interactionally just than public delivery. Positive feedback was also viewed as more procedurally and interactionally just than negative feedback. This may indicate to practitioners that a private channel is more appropriate for feedback and that giving positive feedback may help engender perceptions of just treatment in employees. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication."The new (1978) Chinese phonetic alphabet is introduced and rules are given for pronouncing Chinese names."Cultural variances create different written formats of personal names or different designations of the same elements of names. The elements of names are analyzed per se, rather than being analyzed in terms of the countries where the problem originates. Suggestions are made to help editors identify index names correctly and to avoid merging names of individuals into a common name. Several examples are given."A preliminary study of secondary school pupils reveals the disturbing fact that many score low exam marks in science subjects through a failure to understand the language in which questions are couched. Changing no more than a single word often brings about a marked improvement.The elements of Arabic names are analyzed. Difficulties and confusion in translation are discussed."Support data is the technical documentation needed to support products before and after they are delivered. Most data is ultimately delivered to the customer, but it is also used in-house during development, production, testing, operation, and maintenance of the equipment at McDonnell Aircraft Company. This in-house usage assures that the data gets needed refinement before being used by customers. Support data programs face two basic challenges: cost and schedule. The author describes several systems and techniques that McDonnell Aircraft Company has developed to meet those challenges. Mc Donnell Aircraft Company uses an automated publication composition system. This system uses a computer to capture the text, automatically compose the pages, and produce a camera-ready copy of graphic arts quality.""Although rhetoricians have studied the discourse practices of engineers, little is known about the production workers who must assemble engineering knowledge into functional products. This case study examines what happens when a production worker tried to improve manufacturing documentation, and how her success depended upon both her craft knowledge and the rhetorical skills she attributes to a Writing Across the Curriculum program she experienced in college.""Arguing is presenting an opposite, alternative, or different viewpoint and the reasons for the opinion. The author warns us to consider the consequences of arguing by deciding what can be gained or lost. We often waste our time (and the time of others) by not being aware of the difference between what to argue and how to argue. What to argue calls for considering the problem's permanence, its seriousness, and the reality of winning. How to argue involves remaining impersonal and gracious, stating what you want, sticking to the issue, listening to and seeing the other person's point of view, and not harping on the same issue.""English is increasingly becoming the new international language of technical communication. With 1.6 billion speakers around the world, English has solidified its place as the medium for international exchange. However, the effective use of English internationally requires a deeper understanding of the cultures using that language. It is indicated that effective intercultural/international communication is more than just understanding `language' but also involves understanding `rhetorical' expectations.""This article examines the ongoing development of +POOL, a recreational pool, filtration system, and floating laboratory, to better understand the rhetorical work involved in civic entrepreneurship. The authors consider how the overall development of +POOL as an entrepreneurial venture might help expand the inventive possibilities for civic entrepreneurs coming to grips with wicked problems today. The study offers a look into the rhetorical work of civic entrepreneurship by examining the way +POOL develops a hybrid solution, which recognizes and foregrounds the notion that wicked problems, such as the pollution of the East River, can never be fully understood or known at any one moment. Hybrid solutions, then, offer stable outcomes for civic entrepreneurial ventures that are dynamic enough to continually adapt to the shifting and evolving contours of a wicked problem. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."Asserts that technology has made remote interaction commonplace but that lack of face-to-face contact can be disorienting aExplores rules for remote teams and special behaviors needed to integrate members on those teams"Shows how to analyze a power imbalance and succeed in ethically and diplomatically outflanking a more powerful gatekeeper  Maintains that analysis of power variables can help decide whether to go around a gatekeeper, force a concession, or take a chance.""In today's competitive markets, organizations may be tempted to reduce costs by cutting staff or hiring less skilled, and thus less costly, staff. At the same time, and for the same reasons, the need for higher quality in reports and manuals grows. As companies begin to invest in quality, they are finding that “good” is no longer good enough. To achieve excellence, staff must have the right skills. This paper describes how to find technical editors who can make documents more than just good, editors who can think about the content of the message, not just its presentation. © 1994 IEEE.""Structured document processors (SDP's) are specialized document production systems integrating word processing, databases, document management, and other functions. SDP's make heavy use of standardized document layout and format to convey meaning. They replace less specialized word-processing or desktop-publishing programs when a project requires production of a large interlocking system of standardized documents or the rapid generation of data-intensive documents or periodicals. Three industry examples are examined to illustrate the ways industry is using SDP's and to describe strengths and weaknesses of this new approach to document production. © 1994 IEEE.""This article examines specific manifestations of the generalizations identified by literature in pedagogy in a Chinese university. Method: Five open questions were asked of the university's five technical communication instructors in a 90-minute focus-group interview session to identify the important areas in pedagogy as conditioned by Chinese culture. The 300 students were surveyed to reveal their understanding of technical communication as it existed in China. Features as conditioned by Chinese culture and as manifested in the 300 students were also identified through my teaching and observing their performance in class. Results: The five instructors taught the same lessons and the same course content determined by the university. They focused on teaching professional terms and phrases. They administered examinations throughout a semester to help students memorize the terms. The 300 students generally thought that technical communication was about science and technology. The general audience of technical communication, for them, was basically their country, and the purpose was to serve their country and society. In class, these students often studied through collaboration in groups; they memorized almost everything from their professor; and they preferred a broad thinking style to tackling broad issues. Conclusions: Technical communication pedagogy is governed by Confucianism and the test-oriented Chinese society. In class, students were motivated by the collectivism Chinese culture stresses. Students' rote learning approach was influenced by their traditional way of learning, and the broad thinking style was a textual mechanism for students to complete assignments while upholding patriotism.""Although considerable previous research has focused on Chinese students' expectations and experiences while studying in English-speaking cultures, little research to date has focused on how the instructor's cultural background affects the learning process within a managerial communication classroom Using qualitative and quantitative approaches, this exploratory case study involves two U.S. instructors teaching a managerial communication course to 106 Chinese students in Hong Kong. The findings from this study provide implications for managerial communication pedagogy and further research. © 2008 Sage Publications.""This article explores what sources students use for advice while writing their résumés, their reasons for choosing those sources, and their perceptions about the sources’ quality. Results from surveys, interviews, and focus groups with 86 undergraduates and 20 career counselors and instructors suggest issues with educators’ credibility and students’ access. To address these issues, the author suggests that educators approach the résumé as a research project, which empowers students and legitimizes educators’ expertise. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing."Online help systems are very often not helpful and can even increase the user's frustration and stress level.  An instructional design perspective can increase the effectiveness of online help systems."This article examines website headings used by Fortune 500 companies in their efforts to inform stakeholders about corporate social responsibility (CSR). Instead of using ""Corporate Social Responsibility"" as a heading, companies often use specific terms to identify various CSR initiatives. The purpose of this article is to identify common CSR-related headings that are currently used on Fortune 500 company websites. Data were collected from all Fortune 500 company websites. The websites were further analyzed according to manufacturing, retailing, and service industry. Interesting similarities and differences were found. This study provides guidance on articulating CSR-related activities to consumers, employees, and stakeholders. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Professionals, like technical specialists, have increasingly needed to engage in online communications such as email or posts to online discussion lists. As the amount of their writing has increased, rules for online writing, such as, ""Make subject headings short and descriptive,"" have emerged. However, the extent to which such rules have become conventionalized, standard practice is not known. Consequently, the extent to which writers should concern themselves with following these rules is unclear. In this study, I examine eight rules in 11 handbooks for online writing, analyzing the frequency with which these rules are stated, the extent to which these rules are consistently stated, and the extent to which following the rules is justified. The results show that five of the eight rules are emerging as standard practice but that rules relating to greetings and farewells in emails, emoticons, and abbreviations are not yet standardized.""Explores a variety of technologies, including intelligent agents, information visualization, search engines, and collaborative filtering Examines related issues in the intersection of technologies and humans, including adaptation of e-commerce technology and the role of trust""Ensuring quality control in written communication is the job of a technical editor.

The discussion occurs within the framework of social-constructionist theories and is based on a feminist critique of science and composition. This critique challenges us to remember that we and our students operate within a culture, that we and our students are located within gendered categories and along class and race lines, and that each of us has a history and a system of beliefs or worldview.

Of fering students a conceptual model of the business-writing process, its audience demands and context, provides them with a basis for analyzing writ ing tasks and constructing hypothetical situations around case studies. Student texts written to a case study show student strategies; texts by experi enced writers and a memo written in the workplace reveal audience concerns common to business-writing situations. A conceptual model is presented. © 1987, Sage Publications.

If we agree that inventio is crucial to technical writing, however, we encounter a problem: namely, that the rhetor engaged in invention as part of a technical writing process does not necessarily have expertise in the subject matter of the composition. What, then, is the expertise that the technical writer contributes to the invention process? Working from the notion that knowledge is an activity rather than a commodity [1], I argue that a technical writer's expertise in invention lies in an ability to adapt rhetorical heuristics to situations of interdisciplinary collaboration. This focus expands our understanding of how invention works when the goal of communication is producing knowledge across disciplinary boundaries, rather than winning an argument with persuasive techniques. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""Promotional writing for industrial and high-tech products, or technical copy writing, is gaining more and more attention in the profession of technical communication. In contrast, higher education has largely neglected to prepare students for this major form of written communication. One reason for this neglect may be that some academics do not well understand the role and importance of technical copywriting. Another reason may be the stigma of unethical writing associated with copywriting for consumer products. This article testifies to the significance of technical copywriting and suggests that dialogical audience analysis and an emphasis on the rational appeal will contribute to ethical writing performance. Also, resources are cited of common interest to instructors, beginning practitioners, and researchers. Last, these groups receive recommendations appropriate for their individual activities.""In order to repair defective equipment in the shortest possible time, the repairman needs functional service manuals.

How can they help each other in order to obtain a useful manual?""PowerPoint has received much criticism regarding excessive use of text and the lack of contact with the audience. Why presenters use PowerPoint in this way has not been studied so far. Our study using interviews with beginning and advanced presenters shows that some use the program as a speaking note and as a means to draw the attention away from themselves. Some even think that PowerPoint can replace rhetorical skills. Slides are mainly designed on the basis of commonsense, instead of guidelines based on human information processing. Implications for the teaching of PowerPoint use in business communication are discussed. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""Employing worker and student samples, motivations to engage in flirtatious communication are explored. Six flirting motivations, derived from Henningsen, are considered. Differences across samples are considered using cognitive valence theory as a framework. In addition to differences across worker and student samples, sex differences are also examined. Measures tapping six different flirting motivations (i.e., sexual, relational, exploring, esteem, instrumental, and fun) are utilized. Overall, and consistent with cognitive valence theory, the worker sample is less likely to view flirting as motivated by sexual or relational motivations than is the student sample. Additionally, sex differences emerge for sex and exploration motivations, with men reporting greater levels of each than women. © 2008 by the Association for Business Communication.""Research identifies pleasure, affection, escape, relaxation, control, and inclusion as motives explaining why people communicate interpersonally. These motives are examined, along with a duty motive, in organizational relationships. Investigated are employees' motives for communicating with coworkers or with superiors and their satisfaction with work, satisfaction with superiors, and commitment. Full-time workers (N = 202) report high satisfaction with superiors, as well as moderate satisfaction with work and commitment, when communicating with superiors from pleasure, affection, and inclusion needs but not for escape. Employees report high work satisfaction, along with moderate satisfaction with superiors and commitment, when communicating with coworkers for affection but not for escape. Females, more than males, communicate with their bosses for affection and relaxation. Males communicate with coworkers more from control needs, while females communicate for affection. Both communicate more with coworkers versus superiors on all of the motives except for duty. Females communicate more from the duty motive with superiors versus coworkers. © 1995, Sage Publications.

However, more people should publish because it is in the best interest of the person, and of his company. The author acquires prestige, and sometimes remuneration. The company contributes to and draws on the vast store of knowledge it cannot afford to duplicate on its own.""This article develops a framework for rhetorical inquiry that builds on the concept of wicked problems as conceptualized through social policy and design studies research. Responding to technical communication scholarship that calls for increased engagement with public issues and controversies, the author specifically discusses a writing course that used the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill as a basis for teaching problem-based rhetorical invention, document production, interdisciplinary collaboration, and professional development. The framework described in this article ultimately offers a heuristic for students to research and write about ill-defined problems that must be addressed in time but that demand sustained engagement over time-activities that begin in the classroom but ideally continue to develop throughout their personal and professional lives. © 2014 Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.""This study examined the impact of performance, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and self-consciousness on individual choice to seek videotaped feedback.

Griffiths, Joseph Crane, and John H. Patterson could similarly skew our sense of American technical communication in the nineteenth century. Exploring the written work of an ordinary American mechanician of the nineteenth century, William Stillman of Rhode Island, could help balance our appraisal of nineteenth-century American technical communication. Reviewing the writing and graphics in his 1851 Miscellaneous Compositions, as well as his 1839 lock patent and 1836 bank lock instructions, reveals Stillman's ambidextrous abilities in using both text and graphics to communicate; abilities similar to his more famous fellow citizens. However, the three-dimensional qualities of his 1839 patent graphic reveals an unusual ability to mimic the biological methods in which the human eye sees three dimensions."Administrative procedures for the technical conference are considered with respect to how they affect the author of a paper."Although the writing on science and technology produced by women in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries has usually been considered peripheral to scientific and technological advancement, the history of the mediatrix, or woman mediator, reveals that women writers carried out essential tasks. History suggests that women assumed the role of mediatrix much more frequently than they assumed other roles, largely because that role allowed women to contribute to science and technology without seriously violating gender norms. This article describes the careers and writing of four women mediators: Emilie du Chatelet (1706–1749), Mary Somerville (1780–1872), Jane Marcet (1769–1858), and Louise Otto (1819–1895). The writing and careers of these women demonstrate that mediation is an unrecognized but crucially important aspect of the intellectual activity of science and that mediative writing often clarifies, rather than debases, scientific knowledge. The history of women mediators also suggests that intermediaries are essential for the functioning of the interlocking and overlapping groups and institutions that constitute science and technology and that it might be beneficial to restructure organizations so that the role of mediator is clearly defined and valued. © 1992 IEEE""Let's start educating and training both men and women for the new role open to women—the woman manager.

After analyzing a selected sample of women's scholarship in technical communication journal articles, the study explores whether traditional authoritative writing features conflict with traits more frequently characterized in feminist research as “women's ways of making meaning.” Findings point to a need for more research into how scholarly writers develop a voice of authority; such research may challenge how we define and teach scholarly writing in technical communication. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We begin with a discussion of the frequency of publication for articles whose titles have keywords relating to women and feminism. After identifying 21 articles, we consider the thematic patterns in the narrowed corpus. We conclude that scholarly publication about women and feminism in technical communication has moved from a moderate or radical concern for inclusion to a postmodern concern for critique of visual, verbal, and mechanical ""technologies,"" which previously were not considered political.""This qualitative content analysis identifies 40 articles about women and feminism published in five technical communication journals in a period of nine years, beginning with the publication of Mary Lay's award-winning ""Interpersonal Conflict in Collaborative Writing"" in 1989. Along with numeric trends about the frequency of articles about women and feminism in technical communication journals, this study also identifies major themes, all of which concern inclusion: through eliminating sexist language, providing equal opportunity in the workplace, valuing gender differences, recovering women's historical contributions to technical communication, and critiquing previously uncontested terms and concepts. The study concludes that although research about women and feminism has been accepted as part of the scholarly purview of technical communication, the ways in which this research has influenced workplace or classroom practice are unclear. © 1999 Sage Publications, Inc.""This study investigates female newcomers' experiences in nontraditional occupations by examining the process by which they seek out information during organizational entry. Data analysis included a focus group interview (N = 12) and survey data (N = 111). Miller and Jablin's (1991) model of information-seeking behavior was tested based on newcomers' reports of their information-seeking behaviors and perceived levels of uncertainty, social costs, role ambiguity, and role conflict in their work environment. These variables were tested using correlation and regression analysis. Results seem to indicate that as uncertainty and social costs increase, newcomers tend to be less direct in their information-seeking behaviors. Findings revealed the use of overt information-seeking behavior was related to a decrease in role ambiguity, while the use of a third party as an information source was significantly related to an increase in role conflict. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""A survey to study women in technical and scientific fields was conducted in 1993. The study examined the environment in which women work, the relationship between women's personal lives and their work, and women's interpersonal communication styles. Results of the study supported some of the previous research findings related to glass ceilings and career paths. However, results related to sexual harassment and benefits prompted new questions, and results related to communication styles conflicted with the findings of much previous research. To further investigate these conflicting results, a follow-up survey was conducted in 1994. Results of this survey supported the 1993 findings. Results appear to indicate that the workplace and the women in it are changing. The workplace is becoming more family-oriented, and women are practicing strategies for working effectively in traditionally male-dominated organizations. In technical/scientific fields, men and women have adopted androgynous language patterns, and little difference exists between the interpersonal communication styles of men and women. © 1995 IEEE.""Women technical communicators helped to organize many of the first professional associations for technical communicators in the 1940s and 1950s. For some of these women, organizing was an occupational closure strategy of revolutionary usurpation: They may have hoped to position themselves favorably to shape a future profession that was not predicated on hidden forms of their inclusion. Exclusionary and demarcationary forces, however, seem to have ultimately undermined their efforts, alienating some of them and inducing others to adopt a strategy of inclusionary usurpation. In addition to using gender-sensitive revisions of occupational closure theory to explain the phenomenon of the woman organizer, the author chronicles the emergence of 8 professional associations for technical communicators and identifies the women technical communicators who helped to organize them. © 2015 © Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.""This article compares the historical and contemporary clothing industry with the current microelectronics industry. It argues that the development of paper patterns, along with the perfection of the sewing machine as a techology in the 1870s, ""democratized fashion"" for lower and middle class women just as the development of the World Wide Web and Web-making software has democratized publishing for authors before unable to gain access to an audience for their writing. Comparing the businesses of three groups of women using the World Wide Web, this article finally problematizes these historical and contemporary democratizing technologies-the sewing machine and the computer-by pointing out both obvious and more subtle socioecoomic realities which undercut some utopian promises of publishing in Cyberspace.""This essay takes up the call for a rhetoric of distributed space by proposing a folksonomic rhetoric. Folksonomies, systems in which users may name any object, space, idea, or image any name they want, offer technical communicators new possibilities for how they work in network environments. As a way to explore the possibility of a folksonomic rhetoric, this essay examines 1 specific space, Woodward Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, as if it were a folksonomic space.""A method of costing books is now possible because a significant number of books are being keyed into computers.

Seventy-five percent of the dictation which comes into most Word Proces sing Centers is in handwritten form. The reason for this is the reluctance on the part of the executive to use a dictating machine.

First, the words used do not have much in common with high frequency words in two well-known word lists. Second, a great amount of individual variability was found even among subjects who worked with the most restricted vocabularies. As a result, the core vocabulary common to all, or almost all, of the subjects was surprisingly small. Third, vocabulary restrictions reduced the number of less common words used without any appreciable effect on the usage of the more common words. Finally, the findings suggest that small vocabularies can be successfully used provided they are tailored to their specific applications.""To hyphenate or not and one word or two are dilemmas often raised by common words in common usage.

Some examples of print-media illiteracy are also given and explained.""Despite the other sterling qualities of a product, a set of obscure, incomplete, or inaccurate assembly directions can leave a lasting bad impression a consumer. The challenge is to develop clear, easy-to-follow, attractive setup directions that get consumers through setting up the product. One possible solution is to develop word-free setup instructions to show the consumers what they must do. Within IBM the approach was successfully used in Europe for developing setup instructions for the IBM Selectric II typewriter. For the manufacturer, the advantages include reduced cost for translating the supporting documentation for a product, along with a reduction of inaccuracies sometimes introduced by the translation process - both strong inducements. For the customer, word-free setup instructions can prevent unintentionally hilarious translations of setup instructions, or obscure passages that yield to no amount of deductive reasoning. The rest of the article is a report on producing word-free setup instructions for the recently announced IBM 5080 Graphics System.""This article examines the concept of the efficiency with which text is entered into a word processor-from the perspective of effective use of keyboard shortcuts (sometimes called ""hot keys"" or ""accelerator keys""). The article makes reference to the Autotext facility which is available in Microsoft Word. The article illustrates how the possibility for productiveness offered by shortcuts, available through the use of features such as Autotext, are often under-utilized by many word processor users, academics being no exception. The method involves constructing a word list from a corpus of one's own writing. This word list can then be taken as the basis for a personalized set of shortcuts of the most frequent words in an individual's writing.""This article examines the Work for Hire Doctrine and its importance to technical communication instructors who prepare students to create intellectual products in workplace settings. The author explains how the Work for Hire Doctrine operates in practice, charts the progressive legal treatment of work for hire through caselaw, and calls attention to the developing trend in the courts to support a more protectionist stance regarding creative products.""The purpose of this paper is to make two suggestions about how to write a technical paper, namely, prepare an outline as a guide, and stick to the point.""Workplace ethics has become an increasingly important topic since the 1960s. Companies emphasize ethical behavior; schools and professional groups devote many resources to applied ethics training. However, very little research has explored the use of pre-employment selection measures to influence organizational ethics. This article describes initial construct validation of a structured ethical integrity interview. The article reviews evidence relating to cognitive and impression management strategies used when college students encounter an ethical integrity interview in a simulated job applicant setting. © 2000 by the Association for Business Communication.""Selected communication behaviors of a supervisor with eight-member, ex perimentally created workgroups were varied to create relative conditions of “overreward ”or “underreward. ” Information timeliness, receptive ness to subordinates' questions, and provision of verbal approval state ments were manipulated to create inequities in experimental groups. Mea surements sought to determine if subjects perceived communication ineq uity and to what extent their responses to it were consistent with previous equity theory testing. © 1978, Sage Publications.

But some have instead chosen to work at coworking spaces: open-plan office environments in which they work alongside other unaffiliated professionals for a fee of approximately $250 a month. But what service are they actually purchasing with that monthly fee? How do they describe that service? From an activity theory perspective, what are its object, outcome, and actors? This article reports on a 20-month study that answers such questions. © The Author(s) 2012.""The ability to work in groups is vital for today's workforce, yet the existence of the necessary skills among students is questionable. Although group activities are now common, specific classroom instruction in effective group participation skills is not. Moreover, students recognize the need for such instruction. Content analysis of students' self-descriptions identified ten categories of deficiencies: conflict avoidant, public speaking anxiety, leadership, shy, oral skills, lack motivation, brainstorm ing, impatient,-intolerant, dislike groups. These weaknesses were addressed by a vuriety of pedagogical exercises including individual presentations, type or tem perament identification, an enhanced understanding of argument and brainstorm ing, and ways to encourage substuntive, but not procedural or affective, conflict. Student-perceived improvements were found in all categories, with the largest improvement in public speaking anxiety. © 2001, Sage Publications.

All 15 episodes were examined to determine the role that communication competencies played in competitors ' success or elimination. Results indicate that the ability to persuade effectively was most critical to winning tasks, but leadership skills and interpersonal skills were the most common sources of praise and criticism from teammates and Donald Trump and his associates. Women appeared to be judged more critically for their interpersonal skills than men, whereas evaluations of men focused primarily on their leadership abilities. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""This article summarizes literature on workplace engagement, an issue that affects organizations' financial results and individuals' personal lives. The newest of the four generations in the workplace, Millennials, were recently shown to have different values than the other two prevalent generations. Surveys taken by 16,000 high school seniors of three generations on intrinsic, extrinsic, social, leisure, and altruistic values at work show only the altruistic value is not statistically different. When aggregated, these generational differences have noticeable practical impact. In the classroom, engagement is essential to learning. Examples of engaging activities that address the Millennials' values are provided. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""An MA student in professional writing and editing undertook ethnographic research on ghostwriting in the military headquarters where he has worked as a civilian writer for 18 years. He investigated the ways in which the military's review process (or “chop chain”) influences writer psychology and the final written product. His findings shed light on writer psychology and on bureaucratese as a cultural discursive product and lead him to propose changes in local writing and reviewing practices. To suggest innovations in teaching and curriculum, this article traces the MA student's academic authorship as he drew on the disciplines of ethnography, folklore, social psychology, and composition and as he used cultural theory from Foucault and textual theory from narratology. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Many companies have recognized the benefits of a multicultural workforce and have supported diversity efforts in a number of ways. However, there are still problems for minorities trying to assimilate into work settings as reflected in the many accounts of feelings of discomfort, alienation, and frustration experienced by racial and ethnic minority employees. One significant reason for this is the lack of preparedness for the various programs designed to promote diversity. Such programs are often developed by personnel departments without a diagnosis of the ""diversity problem"" or the input of employees, and, therefore, often end up not effecting significant change. Using the Organizational Readiness model developed by Armenakis, Harris, and Mossholder (1993), this paper discusses ways in which organizational change agents can assess the company's current interpersonal and social dynamics, use appropriate influence strategies, and create effective messages that will appeal to employees and help to achieve the desired acceptance of diversity among members of the organization. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Because communication specialists often lack the power and prestige of other knowledge workers, such as engineers and product designers, managers who direct the work of communication specialists face unique challenges. This study, based on interviews with 11 communication managers, found that their agency and identity were determined both by the structure of the organizations in which they worked and by their use of genres, technologies, and regulatory techniques. With their work undergoing transition because of globalization, outsourcing, and rapid technological change, the stories that these managers tell demonstrate the importance of studying management as it specifically applies to communication specialists. © 2008 Sage Publications.""The author describes and discusses how spoken lectures are different from written papers. Three major aspects differentiate them: completeness, contractions, and connectives. Minor differences between them include: the long asides that are often put in the middle of sentences of a lecture, and the shorter words and sentences of a lecture. As a result of these and other differences, lectures seem more alive and less formal than written papers.""Using examples from journal articles in the natural sciences, the author argues that scientific writing has conventions of personality which are rhetorically constrained. Writers represent themselves and their readers at specific junctures in the text through the use of pronominals, verbs entailing reasoning, modals expressing possibility or obligation, and adjectives or adverbs which qualify assertions. Seven rhetorical acts are identified which are likely to bring the writer and/or the reader to the surface of the text: 1) acknowledging assistance; 2) referring to one's own research; 3) justifying hypothesis selection; 4) justifying methods chosen or departures from established methods; 5) explaining adjustments to results or inability to interpret results; 6) stating conclusions and comparing conclusions to those of other studies; and 7) discussing implications for reader behavior.""To improve the writing skills of accounting students, we developed a structured writing effectiveness program across three junior level courses in the accounting major: tax, cost, and financial accounting. Writing counted for approximately five percent of the grade in each course and accounting professors discussed grammar, sentence structure, and word choice. A consulting expert on writing also con tributed to the program. We tested the results of our program empirically through both a pretest/posttest design and a control/treatment group comparison. The results provide evidence that our writing across the curriculum project significantly improved the students' writing skills. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Writing-across-the-curriculum programs have met with mixed success. We wanted to see how elements of such a program were working at our university. Through a survey of faculty, we found the pres ence of both formal and informal writing policies, differences in standards for writ ing in upper-division core courses, differences in assignments, differences in assess ment strategies and in the results of such assessments, and, finally, differences in perceptions about whether WAC is a good idea. In general, faculty do provide opportunities for students to write, but many feel students write poorly and thus can handle only easy assignments, and many faculty consider themselves ineffec tive teachers of writing. Based on this study we recommend the implementation of team-taught, interdisciplinary courses; the development of standards for writing and assessment ; and training programs for faculty who want to integrate writing into their courses. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Some give examples of different ways of doing this in general, and a few discuss the opening sentence in particular. In this article, 13 different types of opening sentences are outlined, and their usage contrasted in British and American journals in the Sciences and Social Sciences. Implications for teaching are considered.""The article emphasizes the growing need for good technical communication in application program development, and relates the usability of program documentation to the productivity of computer systems. It describes in detail the process involved and the human thinking that must accompany the generation of high quality computer user documentation. The methodology described in this paper has been exercised by the author on two major interactive IBM application programs. However, the methodology should not be interpreted as an IBM discipline, and views expressed in this paper are those of the author. A short bibliography of 10 citations is appended.""A survey of 52 top-ranked undergraduate business schools suggests that profi ciency in written and oral communication is considered an important requirement for an undergraduate business degree. This conclusion derives from a study of offi cial Web sites, with follow-up verification by e-mail. All schools have writing and other communication (primarily oral) standnrds in place; 50 have lower-division writing requirements, and 17 schools have other lower-division communication requirements (primarily oral). A total of 36 schools have upper-division writing requirements, and 25 of those schools offer business communication courses through the business schools, and not through liberal arts divisions.""Professor Thayer believes that much research has dealt with writing as if it wore a unidimensional process. In this article he touches upon some newer areas of research on writing which avoid the unidimensional approach. This paper was presented before the joint ABWA-STWP meetings, Cincinnati, April 7-8, 1967 and published in the proceedings by the Dayton-Miami STWP Chapter.""This study tested the hypothesis that high writing apprehensive subjects would differ significantly from low writing apprehensive subjects in regard to the writing intensity of their jobs. A random sample of 500 people employed in clerical, technical, secretarial, professional, supervisory, or administrative positions in two midwestern manufacturing firms was studied. A significant difference (p.05) was seen in the mean writing intensity scores between high apprehensives (n = 96) and low apprehensives (n = 91). This finding suggests that where a lack of writing productivity exists in writing-intensive jobs, managers might explore writing apprehension problems, or at least examine the match between levels of apprehension and writing requirements. © 1988, Sage Publications.

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether accounting majors have higher levels of writing apprehension than students in other majors. Also studied was whether gender, age, and grades in Freshman Composition were related to the level of writing anxiety. A sample of students responded to items on the Writing Apprehension Test to measure their writing apprehension. The students also identified their gender, age, major, and grades in Freshman Composition. Significant differences do exist in level of writing apprehension based on grades in Freshman Composition but not based on a student's age or gender choice. Most important, accounting majors did show significantly greater apprehension than non-accounting majors.""This article explores the role of embodied knowledge and embodied representation in the joint revision of a small section of a large technical document by personnel from two organizations: a city government and a consulting engineering firm. The article points to differences between the knowledge and the representation practices of personnel from the two organizations as manifested in their words and gestures during the revision task, and it points to the gestures of the city personnel as a principal means by which their greater embodied knowledge of channel easements becomes distributed across the group as a whole. The article concludes by pointing to some advantages of considering acts of writing as embodied practices and by indicating a number of related questions that should be pursued in subsequent investigations of literacy in modern workplaces.""This article presents results of a survey of 150 engineering colleges in the United States regarding writing courses in their curricula. The results indicate that a great majority of responding colleges include writing courses in their curricula. These courses are at both the freshman and upperclass level, may be either required or recommended, and are usually taught by faculty from English or Communication departments outside the college. The results also show that writing courses are considered successful and extremely important by respondents.""Networked electronic text-fragmentary, mutable, connected, and instantly accessible from any computer or handheld device-challenges traditional notions of textual coherence and composition, offering affordances far beyond those possible in traditional, print-based texts, including those made available electronically. Such texts become tools, passively awaiting a user who activates, assimilates, and adapts their contents to his or her particular situation. This article explores the creators' role in such texts, roles that remain underappreciated, unstudied, and misunderstood as a new, and necessary, form of composition activity. Their work is not considered authorship in most traditional senses of composition; although it involves a number of traditional authorial tasks: the decision to connect certain fragments to others, to add affordances beyond those allowed by print, creates the potential for structural coherence and viability of a networked text, potential then realized by users, who themselves become authors of this continually changing text.""Writing to the reader's needs is the theme of this article.

The results demonstrate that entrepreneurs highly value writing and rhetorical skills, produce a huge range of documents, and require distinctive genres at different stages of their ventures. The results can help professional communication instructors, entrepreneurship and small-business consultants, and aspiring entrepreneurs to more effectively anticipate and meet the rhetorical challenges of opening and operating a business. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.""Design technology transfer can be greatly facilitated by studying the audience expected to receive and act on the information. Before writing begins, knowledge of the audience should influence design of reports in the various choices made concerning technical level, vocabulary, organization, etc. During writing, audience awareness facilitates the writing of simple and direct prose. When writing is completed, it can be checked by reference to several mathematical formulas that can indicate its readability for a given audience.""The reading needs of those who have not yet achieved proficiency - language learners, such as adults with normal hearing learning English as a second language and deaf adults - differ from the needs of fluent readers. The author explains how writers can use specific strategies to alleviate the difficulties these readers experience.""The National Captioning Institute (NCI), a public corporation created by Congress, provides captions on commercial and public television, cable and home video for the hearing-impaired. NCI is supported jointly by major television networks, syndicators and cable companies and receives appropriations from Congress and the private sector. Captions are broadcast in coded digital form so that the general public is not annoyed by them, and decoded for use in homes by the hearing impaired. The author explains how writers at the NCI have dealt with this challenge. Both prerecorded captions for video taped programs and 'live' captioning for news are discussed.""This paper presents the findings of a thirty-month case study of how one business writer made decisions concerning audience. The primary objective of this study was to determine if audience theory adequately describes the writing that takes place in non-academic settings. Findings suggest that audience theory does not adequately describe the cognitive and social decisions that writers make in real-world professional contexts. Findings suggest that assumptions about the needs of the primary reader being most important and the needs of the external client who is paying for the report being more important than the needs of the internal audience do not necessarily approximate what takes place when professionals write. Professionals who write do not necessarily view the needs of the primary reader as most important. Intrinsic internal factors such as a writer's sense of his/her own and the firm's credibility, financial rewards, and promotions may affect decisions concerning audience more than the external client's specific need for the report. © 1996 by the Association for Business Communication.""Four benefits of writing for professional journals are: an effect on professional advancement, an enhancement of prestige, financial payment, and ″psychological″ compensation. Some manuscripts are rejected because editors have similar articles, because the subject matter has been recently printed, and because the article may not hold the reader's interest. Five guidelines for selecting a subject are its timeliness, the availability of equipment, the contribution to the profession, one's interest in the subject, and the subject's objectivity. In selecting a journal, one must consider its editorial policy, its use of graphic aids, style sheet, and review policy, and the average length.""This article explores how businesses offering technical communication services used search engine optimization techniques to attract prospective clients to their business Web sites. Method: The study draws on a survey of 240 principals of these businesses, brief interviews with half of them, analyses of their sites, and tallies of inbound links to their sites. Results: The interviews and analyses reveal how businesses oriented their sites not only to a human audience of prospective clients but also to an audience of search engines. Businesses that reported search engines to be more helpful in directing traffic to their sites had sites that, in comparison with those of their less successful peers, featured longer home page titles and received more inbound links. Conclusion: Though search engine optimization techniques can increase Web site traffic, technical communication businesses varied widely in how extensively and expertly they used such techniques.""The writing of online documentation is barely at the frontier, and this article reviews three books which are beginning to define this new territory.

However, the most vulnerable audience-the participants-is left out of the conversation. The purpose of this article is to examine the influence of legal and cultural contexts on participant-directed informed consent documentation. Such examination will help technical communicators make informed consent documentation more user-centered. Method: Using excerpts from informed consents that I translated into Russian, examples from my six years as a localization specialist, and an overview of contradictory U.S., Russian, and international laws, I analyze the legal, ethical, and cultural considerations for informed consent documentation in international clinical trials. Results: The results of this analysis show that international regulations often differ from U.S. and Russian laws. In addition, the culture and way of life in the country where a clinical trial originates (e.g., the United States) might differ from those in the country where the trials are conducted (e.g., Russia). These differences influence the comprehension of information in informed consent documentation and a patient's decision to take part in a clinical trial. Technical communicators are often responsible for the difficult task of reconciling the contradictory issues raised in international clinical trial legislation, differences in legal systems of particular countries, and tensions between law and culture. Conclusion: I offer strategies that technical communicators can adapt to work in the best interests of their audience and to present user-centered information in informed consent documentation.""To date, business communication scholars and textbook writers have encouraged résumé rhetoric that accommodates technology, for example, recommending keyword-enhancing techniques to attract the attention of searchbots: customized search engines that allow companies to automatically scan résumés for relevant keywords. However, few scholars have discussed the ethical implications of adjusting résumé keywords for the sole purpose of increasing searchbot hits. As the résumé genre has evolved over the past century, strategies of résumé ĝ€aepaddingĝ€ have likewise evolved, at each stage violating one of four maxims of the Cooperative Principle. Direct factual misrepresentation violates the maxim of quality and is of course discouraged, but résumé writers have turned in succession to violations of manner (formatting tricks) and then more recently to violations of quantity and/or relevance with deceptive keywording techniques. The authors conclude by suggesting several techniques to business communication instructors that may encourage students to create more ethically sound résumés.""The achievement of both effectiveness and efficiency in communications directed to the technical representative demands careful communications planning. In particular, it demands analysis of the information needs of technical representative trainees, journeymen, and specialists. It also requires tudy of the information functions the communication is to perform - functions such as instruction, on-the-job reference, general reference, current awareness, and consultation.""Asserts that many of the guidelines proposed for the Web have a long history in print Argues that it may be more helpful for writers to use communication purpose and form as the basis of comparison between examples of writing, regardless of medium""Not only do students of technical writing courses need to learn how to prepare documents for translation properly, but students of translation need to learn technical and academic writing. This article gives the example of such a course taught at the Technical University of Budapest.,Hungary. The course covers writing instructions and manuals, documents for scholarly and professional societies and scientific conferences, scientific papers, reports, and abstracts.""The global marketplace and the Information Age have combined to extend documentation across national borders. To date, however, few programs in scientific and technical communication have taken steps to accustom their students to the translation procedures they must undertake and the mind-set they must adopt to ready documents for translation. This article argues that technical communication courses, particularly introductory courses in technical writing, must include a translation component if they are to prepare students for the kind of work they are now likely to encounter as technical communicators.""This article considers how professional writing courses can prepare students in various disciplines for the workforce. Specifically, I argue for Writing in the Disciplines (WID) internships where students learn to write documents relevant for their careers while participating in practical work experiences. In the WID internships I describe, instructors collaborate with coordinators across campus to establish writing-intensive internships that focus on the needs of students and the community partner. This article illustrates the collaborative endeavors of three internships, highlighting the challenges and lessons learned from WID internships. © 2015 by the Association for Business Communication.""Although many business curricula at baccalaureate institutions offer a diversity of internships for their students, English departments generally offer only traditional teaching internships. Because of an increase in the placement of business majors and a decrease in the placement of liberal arts majors, a concern for the ""marketability"" of English majors, and a decline in enrollment in English departments, these departments nationwide have looked forways to increase the visibility of their curricula. Writing internships can offer liberal arts students the ""pre-professional"" experience needed to increase their employability and help generate new interest in English as a career avenue.

This shift brings with it new insights for writing teachers to apply in the classroom. The “Writing Models” approach to teaching business and technical writing presents a research-based, field- tested application of five models of composing processes which helps writers to analyze their own composing processes and to experience alter native methods of composing in order to solve a variety of writing tasks systematically and efficiently. © 1983, Sage Publications.

The purpose of these documents are clear: to increase the number of white Americans to create a clear white majority when New Mexico became a state and thereby prevent the Mexicans from gaining power. In analyzing these documents, the authors use theoretical frameworks from studies in the history of business and technical writing (SHBTW) and critical whiteness theory to show how early textual representations of New Mexico reproduce racist constructions of native New Mexicans and represent whiteness as the norm. © 2008 Sage Publications.""Althoteoh researchers have studied extensively the workplace writing of col lege-degreed professionals, less is known about the writing habits of those without such degrees. This study examined the on-the-job writing of one such group—60 front-line supervisors in a Midwest steel manufacturing plant. Responses to a questionnaire, interviews, and an analysis of 246 documents produced information about the frequency, type, purpose, and length of writ ing produced along with the challenges the supervisors faced as writers on the job. This information will help business communications instructors enhance their understanding of writing on the front line. © 1997, Sage Publications.

They can be applied to user manuals for computer systems and systems documentation as well as non-electronic-data-processing-oriented manuals and business reports. One tends to take both the writing and the logic for putting a manual together for granted, but it's as much a science as management information systems is - just a different technology.""The article discusses perceived problems with the writing of social scientists, including the formal writing, research writing and survey reporting of sociologists, psychologists, educators and economists. Effective research writing should display orderly thought processes, organization of data for analysis and selective presentation of the relevant facts. The use of jargon, presentation of statistics and quantitative analysis are discussed. The failure of the U.S. education system to teach effective writing is discussed.""In this paper, a standard model for describing the structure of research article introductions, the CARS model, is evaluated in terms of how well it can be applied to 12 articles which have received ""Best Paper"" awards in the field of software engineering. Results indicate that although the model adequately describes the main framework of the introductions, a number of important features are not accounted for, in particular, an extensive review of background literature, the inclusion of many definitions and examples, and an evaluation of the research in terms of application or novelty of the results.""A great deal has been written about methodology in the social sciences but little about scienti fic research in business specifi cally.

The author identifies the elements of a useful resume and suggests how to package those elements to emphasize your assets. Other recommendations include (1) being truthful, (2) using factual and concise language, (3) making no mechanical errors (typos, spelling, or punctuation), (4) not using carbon paper, and (5) having someone else read the resume before drafting the final copy.""Writing is an essential professional skill. The goal of writing instruction in business communication classes is to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully meet future writing challenges. However, many writers struggle to transfer skills and knowledge from one context to another. The primary reason for this struggle is that despite years of writing instruction, most people are highly apprehensive about writing and do not consider themselves ""writers."" Writing instruction typically does little to lessen writing apprehension, but fostering writing self-efficacy can both diminish writing apprehension and further writing development. © 2013 by the Association for Business Communication.""Computer conferencing, although analogous to print and telephone conversation, is a new medium. While it is a form of writing, computer conferencing text is temporary. Users of computer conferencing must become aware of the special characteristics of communicating in this medium and adopt new communications strategies if computer conferencing is to achieve its full potential.""If we are to understand business documents in their social, political, and historical contexts we must turn not only to writing texts or to letter-writers, the most frequently cited sources of business communication principles, but to texts like Defoe's The Complete English Tradesman (1727-1728). His chapters on ""The Trading Style"" and on ""A Tradesman's Writing Letters"" are integral parts of a much larger instructional manual designed to prepare young tradesmen for success in the world of eighteenth-century business. © 1998 by the Association for Business Communication.""The marginalization of business writing as a discipline has been traced to a lack of research and to the that many in the field teach in business departments that do not value the work of scholars in English studies. One way out of this position may be an act of disciplinary border crossing - aligning the field of business writing with progressive voices in business and management. This article describes a framework structured around key theoretical concepts from Senge's The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization (1995). Senge's text is surprisingly rhetorical, and I examine the associated framework in terms of its potential for invigorating both teaching and research in business writing, thereby building ethos for the profession. © 2005 by the Association for Business Communication.""Business letters can be more persuasive if appropriate writing strategies are employed. One particularly effective strategy for use in writing business letters is the motivated sequence. This strategy allows the writer to organize and develop ideas according to the same pattern used in the reader's natural thought processes. It can, therefore, contribute significantly toward making business correspondence more persuasive by helping readers make the desired decisions and reach the desired reactions. © 1980, Sage Publications.

We address the divide between instruction in pragmatic and literary writing and calls to bridge that gap. Students working in disparate areas of English learn the strengths and the limitations of their fields, and how text represents and promotes different interpretations of reality. Such written representations do not neatly line up along a utilitarian-literary binary but are more closely interwoven in the presence of a profound subject such as war. © The Author(s) 2016.""The traditional distinction between writing across the curriculum and writing in the disciplines (WID) as writing to learn versus learning to write understates WID's focus on learning in the disciplines. Advocates of WID have described learning as socialization, but little research addresses how writing disciplinary discourses in disciplinary settings encourages socialization into the disciplines. Data from interviews with students who wrote lab reports in a biology lab suggest five ways in which writing promotes learning in scientific disciplines. Drawing on theories of situated learning, the authors argue that apprenticeship genres can encourage socialization into disciplinary communities. © 2007 Sage Publications.""Technical communication may be chiefly informational in intent, but there are persuasive elements in almost all communications. Sometimes, even in technical matters, persuasive communication skills are very important. The author provides arguments for improving these skills, discusses a number of mini-strategies that can be used to persuade the recipients of written communication, and touches on the ethics of using persuasion tools.""Occupational health and safety materials prepared by government and private industry are intended to produce desirable behavioral practices in the workplace, but their authors often lack training in basic principles of attitude and behavior change. A strategy for writing a message which will lead to action - A. C. T. I. R. (Action, Credibility, Target, Identification, Reliability) - is presented based upon the findings of communication and educational research. Written materials incorporating A. C. T. I. R. principles can be effective in promoting health and safety in the workplace especially when combined with other strategies.""Engineers confront an especially trying problem when they attempt to adapt their writing to unknown readers. This paper provides some practical solutions to that dilemma. The paper first identifies four faulty assumptions often made about unknown readers - Instant Recall, Interest and Concern, Objectivity and Reason, and Mutual Vocabulary. Then the paper describes five adaptive strategies, strategies that are both alternatives to the faulty assumptions and ways of adapting to unifentified readers-Identify the Message and the Sender, Motivate the Reader, State Conclusions and Actions, Offer Necessary Background Information, and Write Carefully, Write Well. By avoiding the faulty assumptions and by implementing the suggested strategies, engineers can send forth communique with a high degree of assurance that the messages are suited to the readers.""Recent studies identify gendered differences in communication and collaboration styles which suggest consequences for professional writing classrooms. If, indeed, men tend to stereotype women as clerks, prefer hierarchical collaboration, and value product over process, and, too, if gendered differences tend to increase counterproductive dissent, then the gender balance of writing groups might affect their dominant styles in those respects. However, when I analyzed the behaviors of over sixty student groups in my professional writing classes, I did not find gender balancing to have such effects. Instead, however, I observed other gender-related effects on collaboration: tendencies to stereotype men as technical experts and to self-segregate into gendered working teams. These findings suggest new perspectives on the role of gender for collaborative groups in professional writing classrooms.""Long after a training program ends, the written materials continue to do a training job, good or bad, and to create an impression in people's minds. Good training materials must be well organized, clear and courteous, neat looking, and non-sexist. A full, accurate overview at the beginning is the most important feature of good organizing. Plain, conversational English makes the writing clear and courteous. Using plural sentence subjects helps avoid sexist language. The special problems of writing job descriptions are also discussed.""Research in document design suggests guidelines that both writers and designers can apply to make their publications easier for readers to understand and use. The author discusses the merging roles of writers and graphic designers, and provides some guidelines that document designers can use to reveal and reinforce the structure of a text. The article serves as a refresher for experienced technical writers and as a primer for those writers who are new to the field of document design.""Argues that white papers are increasingly prevalent but have received little discussion in technical communication forums Reports research on their audiences, purposes, content, the people and processes creating them, and the ways in which they are evaluated.""To communicate effectively with lay audiences, it is helpful to use verve - enthusiasm and energy for an idea. Add verve to technical writing and attract audiences by using intriguing titles and good beginning sentences. Hold an audience's attention with colorful, interesting opening paragraphs. Communicate by using analogies, using colorful words and phrases, using illustrations, using humor, repeating and explaining, being colloquial, translating terms, and detailing implications.""The three technical writing workshops the author and a colleague gave to Idaho Health and Welfare Department eligibility examiners were expecially challenging because of the discrepancy in education and writing ability within each group - as well as the workshop leaders' own initial ignorance of what eligibility examiners do and write. The workshops gradually improved as the leaders modified their material based on their increased knowledge of the examiners and their work, became increasingly problem oriented in approach, and effectively implemented inductive pedagogy.""This article presents a narrative of the experiences and beliefs of the author about academic writing in general, and specifically about writing business and managerial communication stories. The author briefly explains his motivations for writing about communication, including urging those that do not write to become active writers, and to highlight the connection between writing and effective teaching. Several reasons that the author sees as root causes that explain why members of the Association for Business Communication (ABC) do not write as frequently as they should are outlined and discussed.""Social constructionist theories, which suggest that scientific knowledge is the product of socially created conceptual frameworks, have influenced the study of scientific writing because of their emphasis on persuasion and consensus. Three books that develop these issues are reviewed. C. Bazerman, in Shaping Written Knowledge: The Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science, shows the social nature of the development of scientific genres. S. J. Gould, in Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, demonstrates the social natures of science. G. Myers, in Writing Biology: Texts in the Social Construction Scientific Knowledge, explores scientific writing as socially mediated narratives.""Communication skills are a fundamental personal competency for a successful career in accounting. What is not so obvious is the specific written communication skill set employers look for and the extent those skills are computer mediated. Using survey research, this article explores the particular skills employers desire and their satisfaction level with new hires. Results indicate that basic writing mechanics are the skills in highest demand, followed by effective documentation. Except for email proficiency, employers do not consider computer-mediated communication competencies as important as traditional business communication skills. The article concludes with curricular implications for accounting communication. © 2011 by the Association for Business Communication.""The article focuses on the importance of effective written and oral English communication skills for certified public accountants (CPAs). The article discusses three rules that the authors recommend be added as required skills for accountants, which would establish a minimum threshold for written and oral communication skills for accountants. The article also states that English teachers should be more outspoken regarding students' communication abilities while the students are in English classes, to ensure they hold the necessary skills once graduated."The article discusses the value of business writing in the college curriculum. The article describes specific subject areas appropriate for the course and suggests their scope and treatment. Communication theory offers a synthesis of ideas about the communication process.Semantics emphasizes meaning in language study. A course in written communication requires strong interdisciplinary support in the psychological principles of persuasion. Objective study of the style of business writing may be supplemented by other forms of investigation."How do your views concerning communication problems of your students and recent graduates compare with those of personnel officers and busi ness faculty? You may be surprised. Do you stress in your classes the types of reports and correspondence for which business is asking? Did you real ize that perhaps only half of your faculty is reinforcing what you are trying to instill in your business communication students?. © 1978, Sage Publications.

The findings indicate that (a) major writing responsibilities exist in various departments within international compa nies, (b) the variety of documents produced are similar to those in domestic businesses, (c) most written do cuments are produced at the keyboard or in longhand, and (d) the major writing deficiency is mechanics. Screening tech niques employed to assess writing abilities before hiring individuals most often include a review of the application materials. Most reported that no specific communication problems exist because nearly all business is conducted in English. Yet the representatives who were interviewed had recommendations for ensuring successful international written communications. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Few firms have easily accessible written policies on communication and few follow a systematic approach to this crucial communication activity. Firms that engage in systematic communication planning, auditing, and policy-making will foster excellence and enjoy a competitive advantage. © 1987, Sage Publications.

This article describes one way to give such word- processed feedback, describes some advantages of this mode over both hand written and audio comments, and identifies some limitations of this method. © 1997, Sage Publications.

The results suggest that written lan guage fundamentals in word selection and usage, sentence and paragraph construction, and other grammar and mechanics remain a problem for entry- level accountants.""Is understanding that transcends language and cultural barriers at all possible? How can we account for the different sorts of failure in achieving intercultural understanding and cooperation? What theory would describe how we can go beyond cross-cultural differences and reach some mutual agreement on business principles and practices? This article explores the relevance of Donald Davidson's philosophy of externalism and Thomas Kent's rhetorical theory of paralogic hermeneutics to these pressing issues in intercultural communication. Using a cultural perspective based on the Taoist yin/yang principle, it explains how an understanding of the externalist conception of truth and the world, and paralogic rhetoric as a theory of communicative interaction, can better enable us to deal with the radical changes taking place in the nature of intercultural relations and communication.""The most effective and proven means of communicating about technical subjects is a blend of text and illustration. Regardless of your drawing ability and experience, you can produce an illustrated document such as a paper, an article, or a book. This article describes how to produce illustrated documents; how to determine when and where illustrations are needed; how to take action photographs; how to produce line drawings quickly and easily; and how to lay out a page that contains both text and illustrations. Using the procedure described in this article, one should be able to produce his own illustrated documents for preliminary or final camera-ready drafts.""As we approach The year 2000, corporate America is focused on improving communications; yet most of the effort is directed toward improving writing and speaking. This paper describes training to encourage and improve better listening skills and attitudes. Workshops to improve interpersonal communications, negotiation, and supervisory skills have been offered to employees for a number of years. The training sessions were different from others in that they were wholly devoted to learning about listening, and managers participated in the design of the learning experiences by using case material drawn from their work situations. This focused their attention on why listening is an important part of good management, and enabled them to understand that it is their responsibility to improve their listening behavior and skills. © 1994 IEEE.""You-attitude is a pedagogically convenient cover term that subsumes considerable complexity, both with respect to the text effects it may include and the text charac teristics that create these effects. Some of the insights on politeness, tact, and def erence found in the work of Brown and Levinson, Leech, and Fraser and Nolen can help provide guidelines for assessing how important a you-attitude may be in writing about a particular real-world situation, and case grammar and information structure can inform strategies to enhance the expression of a you-attitude. Rather than being a binary variable, you-attitude appears to be gradable, and an infor mal student assessment of the you-attitude expressed in ten versions of the same passage suggests that the various strategies for enhancing the you-attitude conveyed by a text appear to have a cumulative effect, so that a greater sense of you-attitude is created when more strategies are used. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Presentations on course assignments are regarded as 'projects to be managed' just as technical problems are handled. The project stages are definition, planning, production, presentation, and post-analysis. A miniproposal is used to launch each project, giving the audience description, communication objectives, approach to the presentation, content outline, budget, and schedule.""A scientist working on a research project of planned duration T - which includes a publication at the end - benefits from describing the work in an interim report. To obtain maximum verbal self-stimulation from this writing act, a time at approximately 0. 4 T after the start of the project should be chosen. A mathematical model of the situation leads to this rule of thumb. The description involves an assumed two-stage nature of research (stage I: defining the problem; stage II; solving it). The stages consist of random (Poisson) time sequences of thought flashes - ″why-pulses″ and ″therefore-pulses″ . The model fits a problem in nuclear physics, whose solution when translated back produces the timing fraction 0. 4. The assumed statistical nature of brain activity is supported by evidence from other fields.""User-generated tutorial videos are quickly emerging as a new form of technical communication, one that relies on text, images, video, and sound alike to convey a message. In this article, we present an approach-a rubric-for assessing the instructional content of tutorial videos that considers the specific roles of modal and multimodal content in effective delivery. The rubric is based on descriptive data derived from a constant comparative study of user-rated YouTube videos. © 2012 Copyright Association of Teachers of Technical Writing."Professional communicators reporting the results of experiments often need to express the fact that the differences in the data were not statistically significant and that the null hypothesis could not be rejected. Communicators may find it difficult to express these results partly because “failing to reject a null hypothesis” is not the same as “accepting a null hypothesis.” Writers may choose to report failing to reject a null hypothesis in any of five ways: directly and briefly; directly with the exact p-value stated; directly with the confidence interval specified; directly with an explanation of not claiming causation; and directly with a discussion of possible reasons. © 1993 IEEE
